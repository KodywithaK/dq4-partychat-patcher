*: 
	Look at the Ventuno. So near and yet so far!
*: 
	If I could just save up enough money to
	start gambling...
*: 
	Pontoon's the way to get into gambling on
	the Ventuno. This pontoon! Ha ha ha! Climb
	aboard if you want to!
*: 
	Ruff, ruff!
*: 
	I'm dying to get on board the Ventuno and get gambling, only...I'm terrified of boats.
*: 
	I can't believe they expect you to dice with death on this tiny raft just to make it to the casino hall.
*: 
	What do you think, honey? Isn't this the perfect location for a romantic getaway?
*: 
	He said he was taking me on a romantic getaway.
*: 
	But we've come all this way, and now he says we don't have enough money to gamble. He says we'll just ⓗenjoy gazing at the ship togetherⓘ!
*: 
	This off-shore gambling operation's owned by a visionary entrepreneur called Rodrigo Briscoletti. He's absolutely loaded, you know.
*: 
	Urgh...
	Ugh-urgh...
*: 
	Mr Briscoletti's employed me to keep an eye on things and make sure no one gets out of hand.
*: 
	Welcome to Pontoon's casino ship, the Ventuno!
	Spend a little time, win a lot of money!
*: 
	People call this ship the Fortuno as well, you know. Because it brings good fortune.
*: 
	It's ever so popular with young couples
	who are in love.
*: 
	Just imagine if you could get married in a place like this!
*: 
	You'd be happy for the rest of your lives, wouldn't you!
*: 
	And people do, you know. Get married here, I mean.
*: 
	Vowing your undying love for each other in the middle of the vast expanse of sea...
	Aaah, it'd be just perfect!
*: 
	Hm? Can't you see I'm havin' a nap?
	Leave us be, would ya?
*: 
	I'm calculating the odds of winning
	on the slot machines.
*: 
	Only, my calculations and the actual results don't appear to tie up at all.
*: 
	I dunno why my 'usband's so hell bent on this gamblin' lark.
*: 
	I en't gonna tell 'im not to do it at all, o' course, but 'e's gonna have to learn to control 'imself a bit.
*: 
	You win some, you lose some.
*: 
	It's all good fun!
*: 
	Mr Briscoletti's a kind and gentle man for
	the most part.
*: 
	But when it comes to the crunch, he can get the better of anyone. He always gets his way.
*: 
	He never takes no for an answer, you see.
	That's the secret of his success, I'll wager.
*: 
	The Captain's seen 'is way through five separate monster attacks in 'is time, y'know.
*: 
	As a fellow seaman, I salute 'im, I do.
*: 
	All present and correct! Nothing to report!
*: 
	The oceans are very dangerous these days, aren't they? Sea voyages aren't so much of an option any more.
*: 
	I suppose that's why there are so many people here on the casino ship. It feels like a sea voyage, without ever leaving port.
*: 
	Dining under the stars with a flute of fine champagne, whilst the ebb and flow massages
	one's appetite...
*: 
	Bliss! Simply bliss! But I've had an elegant sufficiency. Any more would be a burden.
*: 
	Sorry. This is a private room for the exclusive
	use ofⓚⓛ
*: 
	Blue blazes! I, I didn't realise it was you!
*: 
	I'm ever so sorry! Mr Briscoletti did let me know, but I clean forgot.
*: 
	Were you hoping to have a rest, then?
*: 
	Very good. I hope you sleep well.
*: 
	Good morning! I trust you'll find everything you need for your entertainment and pleasure on board.
*: 
	Yes, there's always more fun to be had here!
	Just let me know when you've had enough and want to retire.
*: 
	Sorry. This is a private room for the exclusive use of Mr Briscoletti and his family.
*: 
	Oh! You're an acquaintance?
*: 
	I'm ever so sorry! Yes, Mr Briscoletti told me to be expecting visitors.
*: 
	Were you hoping to have a rest, then?
*: 
	Very good. I hope you sleep well.
*: 
	Good morning! I trust you'll find everything you need for your entertainment and pleasure on board.
*: 
	Yes, there's always more fun to be had here!
	Just let me know when you've had enough and want to retire.
*: 
	And one, two, three, and oneⓚⓛ
	Careful! Don't get in my way when I'm dancing!
*: 
	Okay, so the casino's fun. But nothing gives you more of a thrill than my dancing! That's right, isn't it? Isn't it? Tee hee hee!
*: 
	Oooh... I feel like I just trod on something...
*: 
	It pays pretty well, you know, this job.
*: 
	That guy just won't stop starin' at me!
	I'm gonna go an' punch 'im in a minute!
*: 
	One, two... One and two...
*: 
	Don't talk to me now! I'll lose the rhythm!
*: 
	Don't step on my toes when I'm dancing!
*: 
	I'm working undercover, you know. Checking up to make sure no one's cheating or anything.
*: 
	I'm employed here, you see. That's myⓚⓛ
	Oops! I forgot! I'm not supposed to tell anyone!
*: 
	It really ain't up to much, this dance. I've been watchin' 'em dance them steps for years now, but it never gets any better.
*: 
	If they'd only let me show 'em 'ow it's done, maybe they'd finally learn a fing or two!
*: 
	Ow! Phew! That's a rough dance!
*: 
	I was just going over to let the lady know how much I like her dancing, and I got batted off the stage!
*: 
	Wahoo! Yeah! That's it!
*: 
	Look at 'em go! You can't beat a good, enthusiastic dance!
*: 
	Did you know the owner of this place, Mr Rodrigo Briscoletti, donates his profits to the Church?
*: 
	Looks like I lost today, then.
*: 
	Never mind. We all have our off days.
	Ha ha... Ha ha ha...
	Ha ha ha ha ha... (gulp)
*: 
	All the world's richest are on this ship.
*: 
	I don't know how they all got so wealthy.
	And that Briscoletti fellow must be raking it in too.
*: 
	This is my first time in a place like this.
	I'm afraid I don't really know what the form is.
*: 
	I was just using that machine with all the pretty pictures on it when tokens started tumbling out of it! I hope I haven't broken it.
*: 
	What's happened to this place!?
	It's really gone downhill recently.
*: 
	I mean, I haven't had a single win!
*: 
	When you've been doing this job as long as I have, you can tell what a card is just by touching it.
*: 
	............
	Ha ha! I'm pulling your leg! Obviously!
*: 
	You've got to watch your tokens, you know. Every token counts!
*: 
	One token can become a hundred. And a hundred tokens can become a thousand! So watch the ones, and the noughts'll take care of themselves!
*: 
	I didn't come here because I'd strayed from the path, my child.
*: 
	No, I came here to test the strength of my connection with the Goddess. To gauge the
	impact of my prayers.
*: 
	Dear Goddess! Almighty caster of the dice of fate! Please! Just once! Let me win at Double or Nothing!
*: 
	This is the casino hall. It's got everything for your entertainment and pleasure. Slot machines, poker and the dancing girls, of course!
*: 
	You'll never get bored in here. We won't let you!
*: 
	There was a token lyin' about on the floor here before. It's gotta be around here somewhere...
~ %0%a000120 examines the area around %A0120%Xhis%Z%B0120%Xher%Z%C0120%Xits%Z feet. ~
~ There's something shiny on the floor. ~
~ It's a casino token! %H0860%X%0%a000120's%YThe party's%Z tokens increase by one! ~
*: 
	We've got every drink you can think of behind the bar here.
*: 
	They're all part of Mr Briscoletti's personal collection. He's a real connoisseur, you know.
*: 
	You think it's just a game, but you
	really have to concentrate!
*: 
	I've really been putting my mind to it, but I still can't get all the way 'round.
*: 
	Argh! I was so close! Just one roll away from
	the finish!
*: 
	If the ship hadn't rocked suddenly, the die would've stayed where it landed, and I'd have been a winner!
*: 
	Oh, blast it! You can't play without a T 'n' T ticket you know, no matter how much gold you've got!
*: 
	I heard some monsters have got tickets.
	A wiz pip or a conkjurer or something, I think.
*: 
	Ya don't wanna fink too much 'bout all them games 'n' that in the casino. Or 'bout Treasures 'n' Trapdoors. Just have fun! T'riffic!
*: 
	This is the ship's hold. It's always full, whether it's with casino prizes or passengers' luggage.
*: 
	I'll only tell you once: don't touch!
*: 
	Always worth checking if people are short of a thing or two. It's just good business sense, isn't it?
*: 
	Another day, another hold full of
	millionaires' luggage!
*: 
	No! I've never shirked my duties to go gamblin' in the casino! Never!
*: 
	Ah-phew... Ah-phew that was close...
	Ah-phew...
*: 
	You hear loads of folk sayin' how much they'd like to get married here on this ship.
*: 
	I s'pose it would be pretty amazin'.
*: 
	You know, Brisc'letti's own daughter got married here. It was a while back now, mind.
*: 
	Dear Goddess, we were busy! Runnin' around like mad things, we were. But it was a crackin' ceremony.
*: 
	You know, you look a bitⓚⓛ
	Mother of pearl, it's you! You are Briscⓚⓛ I mean, Mr Brisc'letti's daughter, aren't you!?
*: 
	I'm sorry! I din't mean to be rude or nothin'!
*: 
	I wasn't expectin' it, is all. I mean, Mr Brisc'letti always told us not to let his little bambina down here.
*: 
	I s'pose you're all grown up now, though, in't you? A proper lady, like.
*: 
	Mr Brisc'letti holds a fair few social gatherin's here on the ship.
*: 
	It's all hands on deck at times like that!
*: 
	Ev'rythin' has to be spot on, you know. You've gotta get ev'ry last detail just right.
*: 
	I am preparing ze very finest cuisine for ze passengers of zis finest of vessels.
*: 
	Ze people 'ere on board, some of zem 'ave a very particular palate.
*: 
	To 'ear zem cry out in joy when zey taste my créations, zat is my raison d'être!
*: 
	Ah-phew... Ah-phew...
	Ah! Phew...
	Ah-phew... Ah-phew...
*: 
	Ah-phew... Ah-phew...
	All aboard...for the Ventu-ew...
	Ah-phew... Ah-phew...
*: 
	Honey? Ah-phew...
	Where ah phew, honey?
*: 
	(whimper)
*: 
	There's no rest for a man in my position. Night and day, I have to keep a constant vigil to make sure no one's getting out of hand.
*: 
	Look how pretty the ocean is at night.
*: 
	Ah! A shooting star!
	I wish he'd propose!
	I wish he'd propose! I wish, I wish, I wish!
*: 
	Aaah... A flute of fine champagne under the starlit sky... Bliss! Simply bliss!
*: 
	I was just filling in the ship's log.
*: 
	I can't get out of the habit, even though we don't sail out into open waters any more. It's a captain's duty, you see.
*: 
	Argh-phew... Argh-phew...
*: 
	Ah-phew...
	Nothing to report! All prezzz...
	Ah-phew...
*: 
	The shame! If I don't step up now...
	Zzz...
*: 
	I've been playing the slots so much, everything looks like fruit to me now.
*: 
	Oh, no! I can't see the dancers! All I can see is a row of spinning reels!
*: 
	Ha ha! What a win! What a win!
	I can't stop smiling!
*: 
	It's good to unwind after a hard day's losing with a bit of gentle dancing!
*: 
	Tomorrow! Surely tomorrow will be the day!
	I've got to win sometime...
*: 
	I could dance anyone off the floor in my younger days, you know. Anyone!
*: 
	Watch! Watch the master's nimbleⓚⓛ
	Ooh, ow! There goes my hip again...
*: 
	My hair's all sticky because I was out in the sea air for so long. Normally it looks great!
*: 
	I got a decent bit of shut-eye durin' the day, so I'm firin' on all cylinders now.
*: 
	Everything's ready for you.
	The beds are all made up.
*: 
	Fifteen men on a cannibox chest, Ⓠ
	Yo ho ho and a bottle of Zoomshine. Ⓠ
	Drink and the devil had done for the rest... Ⓡ
*: 
	That voice! It rips your heart out, doesn't it?
	Yeah, the stage was meant for men, not women.
*: 
	No one's going to be cheating in an atmosphere like this. It's far too mellow.
*: 
	Lots of people leave the casino of a night,
	but there are still plenty of ways to enjoy yourself, you know.
*: 
	Leave me alone...
	I'm... I'm...
	(gulp)
*: 
	I do enjoy the singing, but I must say the dancing girls stole the show for me.
*: 
	When you've been doing this job as long as
	I have, you can make a card vanish into thin air
	if you want to.
*: 
	............
	Ha ha! No, no, no! I'm just pulling your leg!
*: 
	I was right, my child. The Goddess wishes us to stand on our own two feet.
*: 
	Now I realise that we must make our own luck.
	Maybe now I'll win at Double or Nothing!
*: 
	Really? You're on a grand adventure then,
	are you?
*: 
	The Ventuno here used to sail the open seas once, you know. A long, long time ago now.
*: 
	Oh no! I'm out of T 'n' T tickets!
*: 
	I'm going to have to fight another one of those conkjurer monsters now.
*: 
	Apparently there's a free pass you can get that lets you play as much Treasures and Trapdoors as you want.
*: 
	If I just knew where to get it... I'd pay
	anything. It'd be well worth it for unlimited
	access to the board!
*: 
	If this ship sank, it'd go down in history, I'll bet.
*: 
	I've been working on ships for a while now,
	but I can't actually swim, you know. I hope the
	ship doesn't sink!
*: 
	I told you, I'm not shirkin'!
	Ah-phew... Ah-phew...
*: 
	Et Voilà! Ze perfect flavour!
	Zzz... Zzz...
*: 
	Poor Mr and Mrs Porgie have both been
	awfully depressed ever since little Georgie
	was snatched away.
*: 
	Oh, what a terrible, terrible affair! If only someone would rescue Georgie and bring
	him home to them.
Mrs Porgie
	Georgie...
	Oh, my poor Georgie!
Mr Porgie
	Oh! If only I knew where my dear boy Georgie was.
Mr Porgie
	Ever since he was taken, it's as if a light has gone out and our family has been plunged into darkness.
*: 
	Welcome, welcome!
	Oh, what a happy time it is!
*: 
	Georgie is home!
	Georgie has come home!
*: 
	Mr and Mrs Porgie are over the moon, and I can barely contain myself either!
Mr Porgie
	Ha ha ha hah! I'd forgotten how jolly fun it is to be together as a family like this!
Mr Porgie
	That statue really did bring luck
	to our family, after all.
Mr Porgie
	I say! Come to think of it, you look incredibly similar to the statue I was just talking about!
Mrs Porgie
	Thank the Goddess for bringing our Georgie back to us unharmed!
Mrs Porgie
	It's rather a shock to see him all
	grown up like this, though.
Mrs Porgie
	I'd left his room as it was on the day he
	was kidnapped, but I suppose he won't
	be needing any of his toys any more.
Georgie
	Oh! I remember you!
Georgie
	It's all thanks to you that I was rescued
	and able to return home.
Georgie
	I'm truly in your debt and I swear I'll
	never forget it. Thank you so much!
*: 
	I say, old stick! Are you in the know?
*: 
	I see. Then I shan't say another word.
*: 
	Rumour has it that there's a helmet somewhere in the world known as a sun crown.
*: 
	Apparently, it can keep you safe from Kamikazee attacks, would you believe?
