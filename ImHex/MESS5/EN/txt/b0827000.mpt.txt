	Welcome to the T 'n' T board!
*: 
	One round of T 'n' T will cost you one T 'n' T tickⓚⓛ
	Oh! I beg your pardon!
*: 
	I didn't realise you had a T 'n' T free pass. In that case, I obviously won't be needing a ticket from you.
*: 
	Please, do go on through!
*: 
	One round of T 'n' T will cost you one T 'n' T ticket. Are you game?
*: 
	That's one T 'n' T ticket, then, thank you very much.
*: 
	You get a total of %a001120 goes at rolling the die here. Good luck!
*: 
	Only one person can take part in the game at a time. Be careful out there, won't you?
*: 
	Oh dear. Looks like you're a bit broke. I'm afraid that means you won't be able to play.
*: 
	Maybe some other time.
*: 
	Maybe some other time.
*: 
	Ah. I'm afraid you don't seem to have any T 'n' T tickets on you there.
*: 
	Maybe some other time.
~ T 'n' T tickets are non-returnable even if the game is not completed. Quit anyway? ~
*: 
	Maybe some other time.
~ No more die rolls! ~
~ Game over! ~
*: 
	Maybe some other time.
~ Out of cash! ~
~ Game over! ~
*: 
	Maybe some other time.
*: 
	Yikes! You came a bit of a cropper there, didn't you?
*: 
	T 'n' T may be just a game, but that doesn't mean you can afford to let your guard down.
*: 
	Better luck next time!
*: 
	Welcome to the terrific T 'n' T treasure trove!
*: 
	Here we have tantalising treasures hidden in five different rooms. Choose a room, and try to find all the treasure within the time limit!
*: 
	First you get two die rolls to decide your time limit. Eleven seconds is the lowest, but you could get as many as sixty-six if you're lucky!
*: 
	Okay! That gives you a time limit of %a001130 seconds. Your time starts when you open one of the doors above. Good luck!
~ There's still some time left. ~
~ Finish hunting for treasure anyway? ~
~ Time's up! Did you manage to find lots of lovely treasure? I hope so! And hopefully we'll see you back here again soon too. ~
*: 
	Wotcha. This 'ere is the treasure trove.
*: 
	There's four rooms, right, wiv treasure in. You've gotta pick one of 'em, then get in there an' get the treasure before yer time runs out.
*: 
	So, ya get two rolls on the die to decide wot yer time limit's gonna be. All the ones is the lowest, all the sixes the 'ighest, right?
*: 
	Right then! You've got %a001130 seconds. Time starts once ya go through one o' them doors up there. Go for it!
*: 
	Tee hee hee! Welcome to the faerie treasure trove.
*: 
	There are three rooms full of sweet, hidden treasure. You choose a room, and then you have to run around and get as much as you can!
*: 
	First you need to roll the die to determine your time limit. It'll be between eleven and sixty-six seconds.
*: 
	Sweet! You've got %a001130 seconds! The time will start to trickle away once you open one of the doors up there. Good luck!
