Debora
	It's more interesting than strange.
	There's always something different to see.
Debora
	You mustn't ever use that staff, %a000090,
	got it?
Debora
	It could be fun to have a dragon as a servant for a while, but it'd be quite an inconvenience if we couldn't turn you back.
Debora
	Aren't you the slightest bit concerned about the inconvenience it would cause me if we couldn't turn you back?
Debora
	I know this goes without saying, but I'd never forgive you if you behaved like that, %a000090.
Debora
	You have to keep a tight rein on your man if you want to control him properly. Just like I do with you.
Debora
	He's clearly been on the sauce a bit too much.
	Ugh! You can smell it a mile off. Not that I don't sympathise with his predicament or anything.
Debora
	Your home's wherever I happen to be, right, %a000090? I won't throw you out, don't worry!
Debora
	Let's hurry up and get out of here.
	It'll be a pain if we wake him.
Debora
	You may not think it to look at him now, but Papa was an explorer in his day, you know. Unbelievable, right?
Debora
	It's mouldy and dark and claustrophobic...
	Can you hurry up and finish what you're doing
	here so we can leave?
Debora
	A bunny girl stuck down in a cave?
	Talk about a fish out of water!
Debora
	You'd easily manage that, right, %a000090?
	I believe in you, in spite of myself.
Debora
	You're finally getting some recognition! At last, the fruits of my labour are beginning to show!
Debora
	I wonder if important people like kings end up in here when they do something wrong. Can you give it a try so we can find out?
Debora
	I was only joking! Think how annoying it would be for me if you ended up in prison.
Debora
	So you wouldn't do something bad even if I ordered you to? Typical! You're such a good boy, aren't you?
Debora
	Goddess only knows what'll become of him.
	I can hazard a guess, mind you.
Debora
	I can't believe you let him go!
	You're far too soft, you really are.
Debora
	Never mind. I'm sure he'd actually be safer in prison. It's up to the Goddess what becomes of him now.
Debora
	That may have been the case ten years ago, but I doubt it's still true now.
Debora
	Casinos are fun, granted, but I don't think I'd ever get that excited about gambling. Maybe it's because
	I have enough money already.
Debora
	Casinos are just fun and games. If you start to obsess over money, that's when the fun ends.
Debora
	It's important to be calm when you're betting lots
	of money.
Debora
	That man's sure to lose if he's in that sort of state. Still, as long as it's not me losing, why should I care?
Debora
	Getting carried away like that is when it starts to get dangerous.
Debora
	I suppose it's not a bad performance. The dress would obviously suit me much better, though.
Debora
	He's right. If you let the fear get to you, it really puts you off your stride. He's wiser than he looks.
Debora
	You make your own luck. You just need a bit of patience and courage and you can turn the tide in your favour.
Debora
	You could've ended up like him if you hadn't had the good fortune of marrying me. I hope you're grateful.
Debora
	There are certainly plenty of uglies!
	I suppose it could be quite fun to people-watch.
	The customers here are such a mixed bag.
Nera
	How terrible that people are placing bets about %a001240's existence! It's just so distasteful.
Debora
	How dare he try to make money by betting on my son! Ignorance is no excuse!
Debora
	I'm sure I'd give a much better performance.
	But of course that goes without saying, doesn't it, %a000090.
Debora
	I know it's just a play, but that mother character really is a nasty piece of work.
Debora
	You'd probably like to see me in a posh dress, wouldn't you? We'll have to throw a party at the castle as soon as all this is over.
Debora
	If you want to open it, just open it.
	I'm not interested, personally.
Debora
	I wonder where the performers came from.
	They're lucky they managed to make it here safely.
Debora
	There's nothing we need to do here, right?
	Then let's hurry up and leave.
Debora
	What funny-coloured slimes! It could be quite fun to keep a few as pets.
Debora
	He's a little bit too carried away with it all, isn't he? It's quite funny to watch him, though.
Debora
	Slimes seem like they'd make quite comfy bedfellows, but they're probably a bit on the...slimy side.
Debora
	I never realised monsters were as obsessed with the weather as us humans.
Debora
	I'm impressed that they managed to build a T 'n' T board this big.
Debora
	It'd be so easy to win if only you could roll what you wanted. I really love winning!
Debora
	He said ⓗtooⓘ, which implies he fell off as well,
	so he's hardly in a position to be laughing at us.
Debora
	There's nothing funny about spending thirty years laughing at other people's misfortune.
	It's downright creepy, if you ask me.
Debora
	It's very lively. This place really comes into its own at night.
Debora
	The people here just want to forget all their troubles and let their hair down. Not that I don't sympathise, of course.
Debora
	I don't mind having a bit of fun, %a000090, but I refuse to stay up late. We've got an early start in the morning.
Debora
	I don't mind spending a bit of time at the casino.
	Let's not hang around too long, though.
Debora
	Let's leave him be.
	He seems troubled.
Debora
	Ugh! As if I even wanted to go in there in the first place.
Debora
	I've got better things to do with my time than go risking my health in public bathrooms!
Debora
	Why doesn't he put a door on his bathroom if it bothers him that much?
Debora
	I wonder what'd happen to all your monster
	friends if the world was at peace, with all
	monsters banished.
Debora
	They wouldn't just disappear, would they?
	I mean, I've grown quite fond of them now.
Debora
	Well, it's not as if I'd go walking about in public with an ugly man on my arm.
Debora
	I've probably told you this before, but I often used to fight with Mama and Papa.
Debora
	I said some terrible things, but they never once even hinted that they'd like me to leave.
Debora
	I couldn't understand why they put up with me for so long. I mean, they're not even my real parents.
Debora
	Now I have a family of my own, though, I've started to have an idea of how they must've felt.
Debora
	...Anyway! I don't know what's got into me, coming out with all this. Hurry up, %a000090.
	Time to move on!
Debora
	He must be a fun-loving soul, spending every day in the pub like that.
Debora
	Fortune-telling is a load of rubbish. You make your own fortune in this life. I know I always have.
Debora
	Either be awake or be asleep, girl, not somewhere in the middle! That was creepy.
Debora
	I wonder if important people like kings end up in here when they do something wrong. Can you give it a try so we can find out?
Debora
	Don't be ridiculous! Who'd run around after me if you were behind bars?
Debora
	Surely you didn't think I was serious?
	You're so gullible sometimes.
Debora
	I can't believe you let him go!
	You're far too soft, you really are.
Debora
	Never mind. I'm sure he'd actually be safer in prison. It's up to the Goddess what becomes of him now.
Debora
	That may have been the case ten years ago, but I doubt it's still true now.
Debora
	Don't buy it if you don't want it.
	I'll probably buy it myself soon anyway.
Debora
	We did pay good money for it, so we should probably have a look. I'm not interested myself, but I'll hang around while you look.
Debora
	Who'd have thought there'd ever be a king without even a thousand gold coins to his name? We must never tell anyone about this, do you hear?
Debora
	This place must do quite a trade with its regular customers. People like you can't resist collecting strange things.
Debora
	If you don't want it, then don't buy it.
	You can always come back another time if you change your mind.
Debora
	You wanted to buy it and you bought it.
	None of my business.
Debora
	Who'd have thought there'd ever be a king without a measly five thousand gold coins to his name? 
	We must never tell anyone about this, got it?
Debora
	It must be quite tough for him, travelling about on his own to find new stock to sell.
Debora
	Casinos are fun, granted, but I don't think I'd ever get that excited about gambling. Maybe it's because
	I have enough money already.
Debora
	Casinos are just fun and games. If you start to obsess over money, that's when the fun ends.
Debora
	It's important to be calm when you're betting lots
	of money.
Debora
	That man's sure to lose if he's in that sort of state. Still, as long as it's not me losing, why should I care?
Debora
	I suppose it does happen every now and then.
	Nothing surprises me any more.
Debora
	If I became a performer, I'd have my own changing room right from the start. Not that I ever want to become a performer, of course.
Debora
	It's best to quit while you're ahead when things aren't going well. Things could go from bad to worse if he's not careful.
Debora
	There are certainly plenty of uglies!
	I suppose it could be quite fun to people-watch.
	The customers here are such a mixed bag.
Nera
	How terrible that people are placing bets about %a001240's existence! It's just so distasteful.
Debora
	How dare he try to make money by betting on my son! Ignorance is no excuse!
Debora
	I can dance much better than them. I'll have to show you one of these days. When I'm in the mood, that is.
Debora
	I don't think it's a famous song.
	I suppose it's not too bad, though.
Debora
	Huh! I'm much classier than she is.
	Never mind. Just get off the stage.
Debora
	Is she challenging me? If she really wants to see me dance, I'll dance. Da-da-daa, Da-da-da-daaa... Ⓠ There!
Debora
	You're not bad, %a000090.
	Not bad, but not a patch on me.
Debora
	How you wear a dress is all-important, you know. Just like in battle, it's all about attitude.
Debora
	Yes, I think I've probably grown even more beautiful since I began my travels.
%0%a001250
	I always get really upset when I read this kind 
	of story.
%0%a001250
	I mean, the girls who become princesses are only ever the pretty ones.
Debora
	What are you talking about, %a001250? You're my daughter. That means you're one of the pretty ones.
