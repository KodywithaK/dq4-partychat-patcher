*: 
	Wayward sheep of the great shepherdess, welcome to this house of the Goddess.
	How may we help you?
*: 
	Welcome to our house of the Goddess.
	Is something troubling you at this late hour, child?
*: 
	Confess all that you have done before the almighty Goddess, child. 
*: 
	Would you allow me to record your works in an adventure log?
*: 
	Into which adventure log do you wish me to record this?
*: 
	In that case, I must overwrite
	ⓗ%a000660: %0%a000090 %a000240ⓘ.
	Do you wish me to proceed, my child?
~ Saving adventure log. ~
~ Do not turn the power OFF ~
~ or remove the DS Game Card! ~
*: 
	Woe is me! Alas, unhappy day!
	It appears my attempt to record the adventure log has failed!
*: 
	I successfully recorded your adventure log.
	Do you plan to continue on your adventure at this point?
*: 
	You would prefer not to make a record of your adventure? Then so be it. You are free to do as you please.
*: 
	Do you plan on continuing your adventure at this point?
*: 
	You intend to rest from your adventures without recording your deeds in an adventure log?
*: 
	This will mean you will restart your adventure from the point of your last confession. Are you sure this is what you want?
*: 
	O great shepherdess, please allow this faithful lamb to rest in peace for a while!
~                   Bless you, my child. ~
~              Please turn the power OFF. ~
*: 
	The great and benevolent Goddess offers
	her wisdom...
*: 
	The Goddess smiles upon you, %a000060!
	You appear to be as strong as you can possibly be!
*: 
	Faithful servant %a000060.
	The almighty one declares you need %a000080 experience point%H0080%X%Ys%Z to reach the next level.
*: 
	Whom shall we ask the Goddess to return to the world of the living?
*: 
	You must be mistaken.
	%0%a000180 seems rather too lively to be dead!
*: 
	If I may... In order to perform this task, I shall require a small contribution of %a000650 gold coins. Can you oblige me?
*: 
	O Goddess of light!
	Our great and benevolent shepherdess!
*: 
	If it is your will, please bring your faithful servant, %a000180, back to this world!
~ %0%a000180 is resurrected! ~
*: 
	Whom shall I treat for poison?
*: 
	But %a000180 does not seem to be poisoned!
*: 
	If I may... In order to perform this task, I shall require a small contribution of %a000640 gold coins. Can you oblige me?
*: 
	O great and benevolent Goddess, lend us your awesome power! Please purge the poison from your faithful servant, %a000180!
*: 
	From whom do you wish to lift a curse?
*: 
	You must be mistaken, my lost sheep.
	%0%a000180 does not seem to be cursed.
*: 
	Ah, it seems that the problem lies not with %a000180, but with %M0070%Xthose equipped items%Ythat equipped item%Z.
*: 
	I trust you will be able to remove the %M0070%Xcursed items%Ycursed item%Z without my assistance, child.
*: 
	If I may... In order to perform this task, I shall require a small contribution of %a000400 gold coins. Can you oblige me?
*: 
	O omnipotent Goddess, reveal your heavenly might! Remove the unholy curse that torments poor %a000180!
*: 
	I will not linger over the matter.
	Just remember, the Goddess smiles upon those who give of themselves.
*: 
	I'm afraid I seem to have asked for more than you can part with.
*: 
	I see. As you wish.
	May the Goddess smile upon thee.
*: 
	Is there anything else I can help you with?
*: 
	May the Goddess be with you.
	I hope to see you in our church again soon.
