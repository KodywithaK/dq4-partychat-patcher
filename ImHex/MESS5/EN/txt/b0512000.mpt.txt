Bianca
	Oh, I get it. So all the cleanin' and stuff gets done of a night.
Bianca
	Gotta keep all the exhibits nice and tidy, eh?
	Folk come a long way to see 'em, after all.
Nera
	When I start cleaning or tidying, I never know when to stop.
Nera
	I find it so engrossing, so fulfilling. It's almost like I'm cleansing my own soul as I go.
%0%a001240
	Is this huge museum all yours now, Dad? Wow!
%0%a001250
	This cloth smells quite nice.
Sancho
	You know, the housework, ees esometheeng your Uncle Sancho ees very good at.
Tuppence
	Er, I'm rather busy polishing my sword skills at the moment to start polishing anything else.
Bianca
	I often used to help out with flower arrangements and the like back when we ran that inn in Roundbeck.
Bianca
	I s'pose it's a bit different to sortin' out museum exhibits, though, eh?
Nera
	You should lay things out just as you want them.
Nera
	There's no right or wrong way to do it, so just go with your instincts.
%0%a001240
	I'd collect all kinds of weird things and turn the place into a really good, fun museum.
%0%a001240
	What kind of plans have you got for it, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Looks like we can't do much here during the day. I'm a bit scared of being in a big museum at night, though.
Sancho
	You know what people esay... You can tell muchos about a person by the way he arranges hees theengs.
Sancho
	I know you make the beautiful exhibits, friend. Ees no question een my mind.
Tuppence
	Sounds like we can only exhibit regional souvenirs. That's a bit of a shame.
Bianca
	Does he mean that he charges different entrance fees to different people?
Bianca
	He's a cheeky old thing, eh?
	Pretty clever with it, mind!
Nera
	I suppose you have to make the most of the
	money you pay out. He should have a good
	look at all the exhibits.
%0%a001240
	I didn't realise the entrance fee was that pricey.
%0%a001250
	He's probably decided to stay as long as he can so that he can get his money's worth.
Sancho
	Ees a beeg place, sí? I believe eet takes
	muchos garbanzos for upkeeping.
	Sí, muchos, muchos garbanzos.
Tuppence
	People who take the money take the money.
	And people who want to stay in the same spot
	stay in the same spot. Simple as that.
Bianca
	That's a bit serious, en't it? Employin' a security guard and everythin'!
Nera
	A security guard? Yes, I suppose it makes sense.
	It would be terrible if things we went to so much effort to collect were stolen.
%0%a001240
	I wonder if the person he employed was surprised when he saw what Old Man Nick Knack was like.
%0%a001250
	You're really clever at collecting valuable items, Dad!
Sancho
	I hope to the Goddess there are no problems here. But you know, esometimes the bad theengs, they come for us all.
Tuppence
	I worked as a guard at the castle, as you know.
Tuppence
	But travelling with you is my best job yet, %a000090!
Bianca
	It's good that we're gettin' more and more
	customers, eh?
Bianca
	It was always nice to see lots of customers back when we ran the inn too.
Nera
	That must be the receptionist there. This place is becoming more like a proper museum every day!
%0%a001240
	I wonder if the person he employed was surprised when he saw what Old Man Nick Knack was like.
%0%a001250
	Oh! I wanted to be the receptionist. It'd be fun welcoming people to the museum.
Sancho
	Sí. Eef the clientes, they are eseeing thees
	old espirit when they arrive, ees no eso good
	for business.
Tuppence
	Now we can relax in the knowledge that things will run themselves. Not that the old man wasn't doing a splendid job, of course.
Bianca
	It'll be good if she brings in more customers. I just hope that's the only reason he's put her there!
Nera
	Old Man Nick Knack's gone a little red in the face.
	Or am I just imagining it?
%0%a001240
	So it'll get busier now we've got a young woman in reception? What would happen if we had a man?
%0%a001250
	The way Old Man Nick Knack's behaving...
	Is that what you'd call love-struck?
Sancho
	Sí, sí. The young señorita, eshe makes a beeg difference to how the place feels, no?
	Ees esomehow much more...happy.
Tuppence
	Oh! Let me man reception with her!
	...Sorry. Forget I said a word.
Bianca
	She's a breath of fresh air, eh? Most girls of her type want to become dancin' girls and the like.
Nera
	It's important to throw yourself into whatever interests you have. That's how people really shine.
%0%a001240
	I wonder what I'm crazy about. Let me see...
%0%a001240
	Hmph! Now I'm confused. There are far too many things to choose from.
%0%a001250
	Her eyes were really shiny. She must be ever so happy about getting her job.
Sancho
	Thees señorita, eshe ees young, but eshe ees esuch a good woman.
Tuppence
	It's lovely to see someone so passionate about something. She's practically aglow with excitement!
Bianca
	Looking at her reminds me of when we used to run the inn.
Bianca
	I often used to welcome the customers just like she's doin' now.
Nera
	One of the fundamentals of business is greeting your customers with a smile. That's what Papa says.
%0%a001240
	She's really getting into it, isn't she? We'd better make sure we pull our weight too.
%0%a001250
	The museum suddenly feels a lot brighter now that Sue Veneer's working here.
Sancho
	The chance to work here, ees worth more to thees señorita than the exhibits themselves, no?
Tuppence
	What a sweet voice she has.
	Consider me her secret admirer!
Bianca
	We'd better try and find somethin' to put on show, eh? He's trusted us with this place, after all.
Nera
	Yes, it's not much of a museum without any exhibits, I suppose.
%0%a001240
	Don't you think we should put something on display, Dad? The old man seems a bit unhappy.
%0%a001250
	I know! Why don't we put lots of things on display tonight and give Old Man Nick Knack a nice surprise? 
Sancho
	Ees a waste, no? The place, ees eso empty.
Tuppence
	It's such a huge building. There are so many things you could do with it apart from making it a museum.
Tuppence
	I'd turn it into my own delicious-looking castle.
	...Oops! Listen to me getting carried away!
Bianca
	He has a point. It's no good worryin' about how things are laid out if we don't have much to lay
	out in the first place.
Nera
	I'm afraid I can't help becoming preoccupied with how to display things, even when we don't have much to display in the first place.
%0%a001240
	It's fun trying to collect lots of exhibits.
	Let's go off hunting for some more!
%0%a001250
	I hope we manage to find lots of souvenirs to put
	on display.
Sancho
	Ees no important eef you have many exhibits or no eso many. The fun, ees een making your own especial collection, sí?
Tuppence
	The more things we can find, the merrier.
	Variety is the spice of life and all that.
Bianca
	Yeah, but it would be nice if people did come flockin' to see after all the effort we've gone to, eh?
Nera
	I can hardly wait until we start to see the customers flooding in!
%0%a001240
	I hope we get lots of customers soon.
%0%a001250
	How do you suppose he's started the news spreading, what with being a ghost and everything?
Sancho
	When people talk, eet espreads like the wild fires, you know. I believe you gonna have many, many clientes esoon.
Tuppence
	I should think the fact that a ghostly old man has been spreading rumours about the place is enough
	of a rumour in itself!
Bianca
	It certainly makes the place look nice and pretty,
	but it might not be everyone's cup of tea.
Nera
	It's unusual for a museum to only display one thing. I'm not so sure it's a good idea, though.
%0%a001240
	Looking at so many desert roses reminds me of being in the desert. Now I feel all hot and bothered!
%0%a001250
	It's nice and spiritual just having natural things on display. I like our museum just the way it is.
Sancho
	Sí, sí. Ees many roses. Many, many roses.
	Ees, er...time for felicitations...sí?
Tuppence
	The old man looks a bit pinched there. I'd say he's none too pleased with you, %a000090.
Bianca
	The place is more like a chocolate medalliyum sweet shop than a museum!
Nera
	We'll have to be careful not to let the sweet smell go to our heads.
%0%a001240
	You like chocolate, don't you, Dad?
	I can't get enough of it!
%0%a001250
	How much did you spend on all that chocolate, Dad? Don't you think it was a bit of a waste?
Sancho
	I no esure. For me, these exhibits, they esmell only like money. Like the chocolate garbanzos!
Tuppence
	I can feel my teeth decaying just from looking at them all!
Bianca
	This place does look more like a ship in a bottle museum than a knick-knackatory, that's for sure.
Nera
	Old Man Nick Knack doesn't look too happy. Maybe this wasn't quite what he had in mind.
%0%a001240
	I wanted to see what it would look like if we filled the place with ships in bottles. It's fun!
%0%a001250
	I don't mind ships in bottles, but it would be nice to put some prettier things on display.
Sancho
	I no esure. For me, these exhibits, they esmell only like money. Like the chocolate garbanzos!
Tuppence
	Well, we've managed to wind Old Man Nick Knack
	up, eh?
Tuppence
	Oh! That wasn't your intention? Oops.
	Sorry, my mistake.
Bianca
	I wonder how many souvenirs there are out there for us to collect.
Nera
	We have lots of pedestals left to display things on, so there must be lots more souvenirs out there for us to find.
%0%a001240
	Wouldn't it be amazing if we could find something to display on every single pedestal?
%0%a001250
	Old Man Nick Knack can be a bit childlike sometimes.
	I think he's cute!
Sancho
	A true man, he no ever geeve up on esometheeng once he estarts.
Sancho
	You must collect many, many esouvenirs, friend.
	And your Uncle Sancho, he weell help you.
Tuppence
	He's a bit of a moaner at times, don't you think?
	It's not as if he's helping find things to display.
Bianca
	It's depressin' hearin' him talk like that. It makes it feel like it'll be ages 'til we'll get the place all set.
Nera
	If he just wants them all full, then I suppose we could oblige there, but I'm guessing he's a bit
	fussier than that.
%0%a001240
	It'd be cool if there was something on display on every pedestal. I'll help you do it, Dad!
%0%a001250
	You won't let it take that long, will you, Dad?
Sancho
	But we can no just forget everytheeng else and espend all our time finding the knick-knacks, you know.
Tuppence
	Doesn't he realise how much hard work all this is for us? Honestly!
Bianca
	Huh! You'd think he'd show a bit more gratitude for everythin' we've done so far, eh?
Nera
	It's hard work finding things for the collection, but we should do our best to keep the visitors happy.
%0%a001240
	He only said it's starting to look like a real
	knick-knackatory. Does that mean it's still
	not actually a real one?
%0%a001250
	He doesn't need to pester us like that. We were going to add to the collection anyway, right, Dad?
Sancho
	Ees good thees señor, he ees eso excited by hees knicks and knacks, but you know, we have other theengs to do too, sí?
Tuppence
	It's all very well just saying that. It's the doing that's the hard part.
Bianca
	Looks like we're nearly there, eh? We've done
	a lot of work here. Just a bit more effort and
	we're finished.
Nera
	The empty pedestals are looking all the more obvious now we have so many things on display. We're not far off now, though.
%0%a001240
	It won't be long now before we have something displayed on every single pedestal. It's pretty exciting stuff!
%0%a001250
	I know you'll finish the collection in no time, Dad.
	You can do anything!
Sancho
	We just take eet eslow, sí? Then I esure we gonna find the last few esouvenirs.
Tuppence
	It's rather irritating still having empty pedestals dotted about, even though they're few and far between.
Bianca
	The souvenirs we collected together are more precious to me than any price tag could make 'em.
Nera
	Now it really is a proper museum! And it's all thanks to your hard work, darling.
%0%a001240
	Who decides how much the exhibits are worth, anyway? I think they're all really good.
%0%a001250
	Every one of the exhibits on display here is valuable because of the effort the local people went to in making them.
Sancho
	Now the aficionados, the experts of the
	knick-knacks, they gonna come to esee
	your collection, friend.
Tuppence
	So there are still more regional souvenirs out there to collect!?
Tuppence
	It's a big old world, isn't it?
Bianca
	Yeah, I s'pose it's stupid not to put our valuable stuff out where the visitors can see it, eh?
Nera
	The old man really took me by surprise, appearing in the gloom like that! I thought my heart was going to stop for a minute.
%0%a001240
	How come you put it there anyway, Dad?
	Don't you like it?
%0%a001250
	He said he'd leave everything to us, but he can't help worrying about it, can he?
Sancho
	Sí, but esometimes, you can no hold your tongue. Ees like when esomeone, they make the paella een the wrong way.
Tuppence
	The spirit of an old man lurking in a museum storeroom... It's standard ghost story material,
	don't you think?
Bianca
	So now he dun't like the way we've arranged things, eh? I wonder what's wrong with it.
Nera
	I think poor Old Man Nick Knack is feeling rather troubled about having left the running of this place to us.
%0%a001240
	So we can't just exhibit things any old how? Museums are trickier to run than I thought.
%0%a001250
	But we worked so hard at putting the exhibits together! I'm starting to think Old Man Nick Knack
	is a bit of a fusspot.
Sancho
	Ees no esurprising, eh? We are no the experts.
Sancho
	But we must try to make the displays eso all our guests, they can enjoy them.
Tuppence
	I feel rather under pressure now, don't you?
Bianca
	It would help if he told us what it was he was
	after, eh?
Nera
	Hmm... I wonder how he wants us to arrange
	things, then.
%0%a001240
	I thought the visitors would like it like this.
	Looks like I was wrong.
%0%a001250
	It really upsets me hearing people talk to you
	like that.
Sancho
	Maybe we are no dedicated enough,
	you theenk?
Tuppence
	How are we supposed to know what's going on in the old man's head? I ask you!
Bianca
	He really had fixed ideas in his head when he planned this place, eh?
Nera
	Perhaps we need to be more careful about deciding which items to display in which rooms.
%0%a001240
	But it's fun just displaying things wherever we want! It is your museum, after all.
%0%a001250
	Does that mean we have to switch everything around? Oh! I thought we'd done a good job.
Sancho
	I no realise thees before. The more ees the value of the exhibit, the more higher the floor we eshould put eet on display, sí?
Tuppence
	If he's got fixed ideas about what goes where, then it would be helpful if he let us know at the beginning.
Bianca
	This'll be the real moment of truth now. We have to do our best to make this place into a decent museum.
Nera
	So now we need to consider the types of things we have on display... My head's starting to spin with all these different things to think about!
%0%a001240
	The museum's full of really cool exhibits, Dad!
	Even Old Man Nick Knack seems quite happy.
%0%a001250
	Different types of visitors?
	I wonder what they'll be like.
%0%a001250
	If we're going to change the displays, we'll have to collect up lots of good souvenirs first.
Sancho
	Now the aficionados, the experts of the
	knick-knacks, they gonna come to esee
	your collection, friend.
Tuppence
	Some of our visitors may be a little hard to please, so it's going to be hard figuring out which articles to put on display.
Bianca
	The visitors are enjoyin' the place, but Old Man Nick Knack still en't quite happy, eh?
Nera
	Honestly! It would help if he just told it like it is one of these days!
%0%a001240
	Looks like something's still troubling the old man.
	But the customers seem happy, so who cares?
%0%a001250
	Is Old Man Nick Knack going blind? Or does he mean that he doesn't like what we've done?
Sancho
	Thees old señor, he knows what he likes, eh?
Tuppence
	I do wish the old man would just lay his cards on the table and tell us what the problem is.
Bianca
	He certainly didn't hold back, eh!
	What a tirin' old fella he is!
Nera
	So that's his problem. But choosing a layout comes down to personal preference. Everyone has their different ideas.
%0%a001240
	Old Man Nick Knack was scarier than a scary monster just then!
%0%a001250
	Well, he might not like it, but I think the way you've arranged everything is really nice, Dad.
Sancho
	Heh heh heh! Maybe he no theenk ees esuch a good idea to geeve to you thees museum now, eh, friend?
Sancho
	But ees normal. You can no become an expert over the night, sí?
Tuppence
	So now we see his true character! I think it was nicer to be blissfully ignorant.
Bianca
	Ha ha! The old fella dun't act much like a ghost, eh?
Nera
	Sunlight is a gift from above. It gives life to all sorts of creatures in our world.
Nera
	I'm not sure what good it does for ghosts, mind you.
%0%a001240
	It's nice to see the sun shining. I feel all warm and sleepy now.
%0%a001250
	It feels so nice and warm. I love the smell of the sun!
Sancho
	Sí. Thees ees mañana. Ees very important.
	Ees good to relax esometimes, you know.
Tuppence
	Zzz... Oh dear! I seem to have fallen asleep... Zzz...zzz...
Bianca
	It's nice to see folk havin' a fun time of it.
	We did a good job here.
Nera
	Seeing people's smiling faces is the best reward for our efforts there could ever be.
%0%a001240
	It feels great to give people a good time like this!
%0%a001250
	It was hard work figuring out how to display everything, but it was well worth it.
Sancho
	Esuccess, ees a good feeling, sí?
Tuppence
	After all the hard work you did, I should hope we have even more visitors come along to enjoy it.
Bianca
	We've certainly got a rare old bunch of stuff on display at the moment, eh?
Bianca
	It was worth all the effort, %a000090.
Nera
	That's what's so great about a museum. It gives people the opportunity to see things they would never normally come across.
%0%a001240
	There are so many different types of things to collect. This is really good fun!
%0%a001250
	People who don't have much chance to travel
	can come here and feel like they've travelled the whole world.
Sancho
	Sí. These exhibits, they eshow the cultures from all over the world. We have eso many different theengs here now.
Tuppence
	I hadn't seen a lot of the things we have on display before myself. I wouldn't mind having a closer look when there's more time.
Bianca
	Blimey! We must've done a good job for him to be
	so complimentary!
Nera
	I think that's possibly the first time he's ever paid us a compliment!
%0%a001240
	Yay! Of course the place looks cool.
	My dad did it, that's why!
%0%a001250
	I hope I grow up like you, Dad. You always try so hard, and you never give up.
Sancho
	You have always been the hard worker, friend. Even from when you are esmall.
Tuppence
	I'm sure part of his compliment there was directed at me for my efforts too. How embarrassing!
Bianca
	She's pretty keen, eh? I dun't think we'll have any problems leavin' the reception to her.
Nera
	Old Man Nick Knack did well employing her.
	She's certainly dedicated to the job.
%0%a001240
	She's really getting into it, isn't she? We'd better make sure we pull our weight too.
%0%a001250
	The museum suddenly feels a lot brighter now that Sue Veneer's working here.
Sancho
	Thees señorita, eshe ees young, but eshe ees esuch a good woman.
Tuppence
	It's lovely to see someone so passionate about something. She's practically aglow with excitement!
Bianca
	I s'pose we'd better have a look at that note next time we're thinkin' of exhibitin' somethin'.
Nera
	Sue seems like a very studious type. It's good for Old Man Nick Knack to have someone to pass his
	ideas on to.
%0%a001240
	She's so lucky! If only we had that note, it would be much easier to know how to plan the exhibits.
%0%a001250
	I wonder who decides what the different articles are worth. Do you think it's Old Man Nick Knack?
Sancho
	I no realise thees before. The more ees the value of the exhibit, the more higher the floor we eshould put eet on display, sí?
Tuppence
	So the more valuable items get a higher rating. Correct?
Bianca
	New articles? Sounds like Old Man Nick Knack's hard at work findin' out stuff for us, eh?
Nera
	Ooh. I wonder what these new articles might be.
%0%a001240
	Ooh! It'll be fun going off hunting for new items.
	I hope we find them soon!
%0%a001250
	We should definitely try and find them if we can.
	Old Man Nick Knack went to all that effort to find out about them for us, after all.
Sancho
	Eso there are more esouvenirs we no find yet. I hope we find them esoon.
Tuppence
	More articles? Just how many of these souvenirs are there dotted about the world?
Bianca
	That weren't our intention, eh? I wonder what it is we've done wrong.
Nera
	Well, we didn't mean for him to feel that way. It looks like he's finding it rather hard to trust us now.
%0%a001240
	Oops. He doesn't sound happy. We should put something on display. One thing would probably
	be better than nothing.
%0%a001250
	I'm sure you must have your reasons, Dad.
	He just can't understand them, that's all.
Sancho
	Ees really hurting thees old señor to esee all these theengs een the storeroom, eh?
Tuppence
	It's really not my place to question your reasoning. Nonetheless...
Bianca
	He's certainly got high hopes, eh? We'll have to make sure we make a go of this place.
Nera
	It sounds like he's hoping we'll fulfil his dream for him. Well, we'll try our best, won't we?
%0%a001240
	I'm really looking forward to seeing what you'll do with the place too!
%0%a001250
	He he! So now you're a museum curator as well as
	a king!
Sancho
	Thees maxi medal, ees estrange, sí?
	You no want to know more about eet?
Tuppence
	You're the boss! Naturally, I'll support you in all of your endeavours.
Bianca
	I'm sure you en't doin' this to try and wind him up...are you?
Bianca
	Still, it's not much of a museum if it just has the same old thing on display all the way through.
Nera
	We should probably try to exhibit a wider variety of things, I suppose. That's how museums usually work.
%0%a001240
	I quite like how it is now, but I suppose we have to think about our visitors too.
%0%a001250
	It looks more like a shop than a museum
	at the moment.
Sancho
	Maybe ees better eef we change esome theengs to make thees old señor happy, no?
Tuppence
	If this is what suits your fancy, then you should keep it as it is. There's no hard and fast rule when
	it comes to museums.
Bianca
	You can't help but find him endearin', even though he is a grumpy old soul.
Nera
	The old man probably never had to deal with this kind of thing before.
%0%a001240
	Thank the Goddess we've got a bit of advance warning! It could be quite scary having him jump
	out on you unannounced.
%0%a001250
	You may be in charge of the museum now, Dad, but I think you still have to try and listen to what Old Man Nick Knack wants.
Sancho
	We no do thees to make thees señor unhappy. Ees no need to escare us.
Tuppence
	I thought he was just a harmless old man, but now I've seen his diary, I'm not so sure!
Bianca
	So we've finally crossed the first hurdle.
	There's still a long way to go, mind.
Nera
	It's always hard at the beginning. We mustn't let it make us lose heart.
%0%a001240
	Old Man Nick Knack will be pleased when we get more things to put on display.

	Old Man Nick Knack must work very hard at writing his diary. Maybe I should start one too.
Sancho
	Sí. Ees right no to go too fast, or maybe you
	put yourself een weeth the horses' feet, eh?
	Ees a dangerous place, comprende?
Tuppence
	I'm sure you'll soon turn the place into a fine museum, %a000090.
Bianca
	We're all lookin' forward to when this place is a full house, eh?
Bianca
	Not far to go now.
Nera
	I can't wait to see all the pedestals full, either.
%0%a001240
	I've been looking forward to filling the whole place up for ages. I hope we manage it soon.
%0%a001250
	I'm sure you'll have the place full in no time, Dad.
	I can't wait!
Sancho
	You need just a leettle more effort, friend.
	Can you do eet? You are no too tired?
Tuppence
	It's just a matter of time before all the pedestals are full now.
Bianca
	That's basically a roundabout way of him sayin' you en't got no taste, en't it?
Nera
	I'm surprised he's still not satisfied. We filled up all the pedestals like he wanted, after all.
%0%a001240
	Are we still not done yet, then?
	Museums are really hard work!
%0%a001250
	I thought he said we could just exhibit things how
	we wanted!
Sancho
	Thees know-how, ees no esometheeng you can just pick eet up, eh? Ees gonna take time.
Tuppence
	When one job ends, there's always another one waiting in the wings. The work here is never-ending!
Bianca
	If only he'd give us that kind of information, it'd be a big help.
Nera
	It sounds like Old Man Nick Knack is quite taken with Sue Veneer.
%0%a001240
	Sue Veneer's really clever, you know.
%0%a001250
	It sounds like he's giving Sue lots and lots of instructions. She must be working hard too.
Sancho
	When you esee the young señorita working eso hard, ees a beautiful esight, sí?
Sancho
	Thees old señor, he ees enjoying eet too.
Tuppence
	Surely he's not secretly carrying a torch for her,
	is he? No, surely not!
Bianca
	I hardly think the place looks like a joke!
	I wonder what it is that's so wrong with it.
Nera
	I'm afraid Old Man Nick Knack obviously likes to let off steam in his diary and say all the hurtful things he can't say to our faces.
%0%a001240
	Do you think the visitors see the place as a joke too? That wouldn't be very good.
%0%a001250
	I thought he said we could just exhibit things how
	we wanted!
Sancho
	He esay to us, we put these knicks and knacks where we want, no? But he no like eet when we do eet.
Tuppence
	We'd better do something about the place before the poor old man drives himself delirious!
Bianca
	It dun't sound like Old Man Nick Knack is too pleased with the way we're displayin' things.
Bianca
	I wonder if the sigh we sometimes hear when
	we put somethin' new on display is him showin'
	his disapproval.
Nera
	Sounds like we need to be a bit more careful about how we arrange our displays.
%0%a001240
	Don't worry, Dad. I'm sure you'll have it cracked before long.
%0%a001250
	He should tell us to our faces if he has a problem with what we're doing here.
Sancho
	Thees señor, he wants to esay to us eso bad that he no like how we arrange the exhibits, eh?
	Ees like the barracuda weeth no teeth.
Tuppence
	If we just tweak the displays, then I'm sure he'll be happy. Just a little more effort and we'll be there.
Bianca
	I reckon it'll be a great museum if we keep goin' at this rate.
Nera
	This is our first time running a museum, so there's obviously a learning curve, but I think we're getting there now.
%0%a001240
	He says we're having a good bash, but we clearly haven't quite got it how he wants yet, have we?
%0%a001250
	I wonder how we're supposed to get a better feel for the job. That sounds like hard work.
Sancho
	Ees no esometheeng you master een a few days, thees knick-knack esport. But you get a leettle better every day, sí?
Tuppence
	This is his version of being fairly pleased with us,
	is it? It's rather hard to tell.
Bianca
	Brilliant! We've finally made the old man happy at
	long last!
Nera
	What a relief! It sounds like Old Man Nick Knack is finally satisfied with what we've done.
%0%a001240
	I always knew you could do it, Dad!
%0%a001250
	Old Man Nick Knack says you did it just as he would've done it himself. I think you probably
	did it even better than that!
Sancho
	You esee, friend? Thees señor, he likes you now because you are esuch a good curator.
Tuppence
	That's the way. You're a proper curator now, %a000090.
Bianca
	I didn't know she had that kind of side to her too.
Nera
	I'm not too bad when it comes to baking cakes myself. You'll have to have a taste one of these days.
%0%a001240
	Oh! I wish I could've tried some of her cakes!
%0%a001250
	So Sue's been baking cakes? I've been wanting to do some baking of my own for ages now.
Sancho
	Your Uncle Sancho, he ees good at baking the cakes too, you know. Sí, sí. And he ees good at eating them too.
Tuppence
	So she's good at baking cakes, is she? Mmm...
	Now there's a quality I admire in a woman.
Bianca
	I reckon you're doin' a really good job of runnin' this place, %a000090.
Nera
	Getting customers in through the doors is a real skill. That's what Papa always says.
Nera
	And you've certainly managed to do that
	here, darling.
%0%a001240
	You worked really hard, Dad. The visitors can see that, I'm sure.
%0%a001250
	I wonder what could be bothering Old Man Nick Knack. Surely nothing can be wrong if we have this many visitors.
Sancho
	Ees black? Sí, ees dark. But ees no black.
Tuppence
	It sometimes feels so long since we embarked on all this, and yet sometimes it feels like only yesterday. It's very odd.
Bianca
	He recognised the Catas Trophy! He certainly knows his stuff, does Old Man Nick Knack.
Nera
	He he he! Do you think he'll really be able to stop himself from grumbling?
%0%a001240
	If he stopped grumbling, then he wouldn't be like Old Man Nick Knack any more. That'd be a bit sad.
%0%a001250
	Old Man Nick Knack seems really surprised.
	The Catas Trophy must be really valuable.
Sancho
	I no believe eet too, when you get thees Catas Trophy, friend. You are estrong and macho now,
	My Majesty.
Tuppence
	I doubt anyone other than you would be able to get hold of something like that to display, %a000090.
Bianca
	Yep, I reckon our museum could hold its head up high in the museum world now!
Nera
	It's nice to hear the old man so happy with us.
	The museum really is a success now.
%0%a001240
	Oh yeah. I'd kind of forgotten that Old Man Nick Knack was a ghost.
%0%a001250
	Hearing Old Man Nick Knack so happy with us is enough to make me forget about all the hard work we put in.
Sancho
	Sí. You do esuch a good job, friend.
	You collect eso many knick-knacks.
Tuppence
	He's not been so moved since the day he died?
	Now there's a sentence you don't read every day!
Bianca
	Sue Veneer can never do anythin' wrong in the old man's eyes, eh?
Nera
	I think I would've been rather afraid if I were her, chatting away to a ghostly old man in a museum in the dead of night!
%0%a001240
	Receptionists have to be good talkers.
	It goes with the job.
%0%a001250
	Old Man Nick Knack really does like Sue Veneer, doesn't he?
Sancho
	Thees young señorita, eshe likes to espeak. Eshe ees no estupid, eh?
Tuppence
	So she's a good talker, is she? How delightful!
Bianca
	I s'pose you can't blame him for thinkin' that.
	I mean, the place is still pretty empty.
Nera
	It's a shame he thinks the place feels a bit creepy. Hopefully we'll have it looking nicer before long.
%0%a001240
	A customer! I wonder if that's thanks to Old Man Nick Knack spreading the news.
%0%a001250
	It might be a little bit creepy, but it's in a lovely spot, surrounded by the forest like it is.
Sancho
	Ees a customer! You must be nice to
	heem, okay?
Tuppence
	I hope he doesn't see the old man and get a fright!
Bianca
	This building in itself is a good advert for the museum if people are just stumblin' across it like that.
Nera
	I don't think people are coming because they've heard of the place. Not yet, anyway.
%0%a001240
	Let's collect up lots of cool souvenirs and make this place into the best museum ever!
%0%a001250
	It is very grand, but no one really knows about there being a museum here yet.
Sancho
	Ees no right that thees señor, he has come here to esee the building and no the exhibits.
Tuppence
	I suppose it is a surprisingly grand building to find in the middle of a forest like this.
Bianca
	I wonder if he came from a long way away. Hopefully it won't be long before we dazzle folk with our exhibits as well as just the buildin' itself.
Nera
	Do you think that man came here especially because he heard about the museum?
%0%a001240
	Everyone who comes here for the first time seems really impressed by the building.
%0%a001250
	Hopefully we'll impress people even more with our displays before long.
Sancho
	The clientes, they are coming fat and fast now, sí?
Tuppence
	By the sound of his accent, I'd say he's travelled a fair old way to get here.
Bianca
	We should put even more things on display if we want to keep the customers happy, eh?
Nera
	I think we need to increase the number of exhibits if we want to keep our visitors interested.
%0%a001240
	There's still a long way to go, though. Hopefully we'll have the place full of exhibits before too long!
%0%a001250
	Is this what a real museum feels like? I've never been to one before, so I don't really know.
Sancho
	The clientes, they are coming fat and fast now, sí?
Tuppence
	I suppose it is a surprisingly grand building to find in the middle of a forest like this.
Bianca
	I'm not sure if that means he likes it or he dun't!
Nera
	Well, we certainly seem to have surprised him!
%0%a001240
	What does he mean by that? Is he happy or not?
%0%a001250
	I think maybe that man thought the place wasn't like a proper museum.
Sancho
	These displays, I theenk ees gonna make every cliente feel thees way.
Tuppence
	It is rather overwhelming to see so many of the same thing on display.
Bianca
	Seein' all these things on display reminds me of all the places we've visited.
Nera
	Every one of the items we have here is special because of the effort the local people put into
	making them.
Nera
	And they all remind me of the different places we went to together to collect them.
%0%a001240
	I bet there are still lots more souvenirs out there in places I haven't been to yet.
%0%a001240
	We'll have to go off hunting for them
	together sometime!
%0%a001250
	When you look at special souvenirs like this, you can really feel the effort that went into making them.
Sancho
	For the esouvenirs, ees no just about how much you pay for them.
Sancho
	Ees about the feeling the artisan, he puts eenside thees esouvenir when he ees making eet.
	Ees from thees where comes the real value.
Tuppence
	There are all kinds of souvenirs out there, from the useful to the utterly ridiculous!
Bianca
	He certainly is quite a man! It's a bit embarrassin' bein' praised like that, though, eh?
Nera
	It really is very encouraging to hear people being so appreciative of all the hard work we've done here.
%0%a001240
	Yeah, he's right. There aren't even that many people just travelling the world now.
%0%a001250
	Do you think Old Man Nick Knack told him that it's you who's been collecting up all the souvenirs to display?
Sancho
	Ees because you find them yourself that these exhibits, they have eso much meaning for you, sí, friend?
Tuppence
	It's quite a responsibility for people who are kings and curators and the like.
Bianca
	The rarer the exhibits? I reckon the stuff on
	display up here's quite a bit rarer than what's downstairs, eh?
Nera
	I think the more common exhibits are full of charm.
	I'm sure plenty of people would come to see them too.
%0%a001240
	This room's so amazing it makes people want to sing! We'd better save it for our best exhibits.
%0%a001250
	I can't decide which is prettier: that man's singing voice or this room's decoration. I like pretty things. Let's put lots of pretty things on display!
Sancho
	Sí, sí. Esome items, they are more rare than the others. You must look at your item carefully to know eef ees a good one or no.
Sancho
	Your Uncle Sancho, he ees good at judging the esouvenirs, you know.
Tuppence
	I'm afraid I find it rather hard to relax if the decor in a room is too much on the grand side.
Bianca
	The museum itself is quite a display piece, eh?
	The outside is all nice and natural, and the inside
	is really relaxin'.
Nera
	There's nothing more beautiful than art that's filled with leaves rustling in the wind on sun-bathed branches.
%0%a001240
	It does smell nice and green here.
%0%a001250
	It feels nice to be in the forest, surrounded by living trees all around.
Sancho
	Thees museum, eet no eseems to be out of place een the forest. Ees like ees just a beeg tree!
Tuppence
	Being in the middle of a forest is certainly an unusual sensation.
Bianca
	You certainly dun't often come across places like this, eh? Maybe this is the only one in the world.
Nera
	It's very rewarding to have people coming to visit from far and wide.
%0%a001240
	Chic? What does that mean?
%0%a001250
	Does chic just mean pretty? Or was she trying to speak like Sancho does?
Sancho
	Thees señora, eshe ees eso elegant. Eshe knows what ees chic and what ees no chic.
Tuppence
	Yes, the museum building itself is quite a curiosity.
Bianca
	I wonder if he was here researchin' somethin' or other. I hope the place can be of use to him.
Nera
	I heard that some people like to carry out research on the world's various regional souvenirs.
%0%a001240
	Studying from books is all well and good, but
	it's better if you can actually get to see the real thing too.
%0%a001250
	Do you think he came here to study?
Sancho
	Sí, sí. Thees museum ees just right for estudying the cultures and the foreign places, no?
Tuppence
	He seems the type to study something to the nth degree once it's piqued his interest.
Bianca
	A stunnin' exhibit, eh? It's pretty tricky figurin' out what to put on display in such a grand-lookin' room.
Nera
	I'm sure that doesn't mean only a beautiful exhibit would work. Something interesting would work too. We should experiment with a few ideas.
%0%a001240
	A stunning exhibit? Why would it need to
	be stunning?
%0%a001250
	A stunning exhibit sounds like an expensive exhibit
	to me.
Sancho
	Ees true. Thees exhibit you put on display een here, ees the pride of the museum.
Tuppence
	I'm sure that anything we put on display in here would look quite lovely.
Bianca
	The museum's here for everyone to enjoy, so I hope they dun't feel too overwhelmed by the place.
Nera
	We should try and make sure it's the kind of place everyone feels welcome in, don't you think, darling?
%0%a001240
	Why would anyone feel nervous here?
	I think the place is cool!
%0%a001250
	When you feel really nervous like that, you start to hear your own heart beating.
Sancho
	Sí, ees true. Ees no easy to relax een a building when ees eso grand. Esome people, they no even want to go eenside.
Tuppence
	Looks like they're not very well acquainted with places like this.
Bianca
	Honeymoon, eh? Reminds me of when you and me had just got married, %a000090.
Nera
	I don't mind where we go. As long as I'm with you, I'm happy
Nera
	And that includes our travels together now,
	of course.
%0%a001240
	Hey, I just had a thought. Isn't Sancho married?
%0%a001250
	I wonder if I'll get married one day.
Sancho
	When I hear esomeone talking about the
	weddings, I weesh I could esee your
	wedding, friend. I, I... (sniff)
Tuppence
	I hope I'll find myself a beautiful bride one of
	these days.
Bianca
	Fair enough. You can see why he wouldn't want to travel too much if it'd put his wife in danger.
Bianca
	You dun't need to worry about me, though, %a000090. I'll stick by your side wherever
	you go.
Nera
	If you love a person, then you'll gladly go anywhere with them. That's the way I feel, anyway.
%0%a001240
	It's up to us to save the world and make it peaceful again so that people can go wherever they want.
%0%a001250
	Souvenirs don't tell the whole story though, do they? I mean, there's more to the world than what's on display here.
%0%a001250
	I hope it's safe again soon for people to travel all over and see all the amazing places there are.
Sancho
	Eef thees señor, he ees hoping to impress hees wife, he must take her to every dark corner of thees place.
Tuppence
	It's certainly not easy travelling about the place these days, that's for sure.
Bianca
	D'you reckon he come all this way to see his work
	on display?
Nera
	I should think that man's over the moon to see something he made with his own hands on
	display here.
%0%a001240
	What? That man made one of the exhibits?
	Which one?
%0%a001250
	He says he made one of the exhibits, but he won't tell anyone which one it is.
Sancho
	Thees señor, he no espeak like the great artisan.
	I wonder which ees the exhibit that he made...
Tuppence
	He must be pretty convinced he's made a marvel of a knick-knack to be showing off about it like that.
Bianca
	I dun't remember seein' anythin' in here
	before, personally.
Nera
	There are lots of other rooms to see in the museum. He should look around more.
%0%a001240
	What's that man talking about?
%0%a001250
	Is that man just having us on?
Sancho
	Ees good we have eso many different señores and señoras coming to visit, no?
Tuppence
	Which exhibit was that man looking at exactly when he said that? Sounds a bit fishy to me.
Bianca
	It's hard to imagine anyone'd forget somethin' they made 'emselves.
Bianca
	Maybe that kid's right.
Nera
	Do you think the man was just teasing that little boy? Or do you think...?
%0%a001240
	Lying's wrong! Lying's the first step to becoming
	a thief!
%0%a001250
	I don't know if I believe him, either.
	I've just got a funny feeling about him.
Sancho
	Ees only thees man heemself who knows eef ees the truth or no.
Tuppence
	Don't you think he just means he dabbles in all sorts of things? You know, sort of a jack of all trades.
Bianca
	Little kids are always so curious. It's impossible to stop 'em wanderin' off lookin' at everythin', eh?
Nera
	It's really very healthy for little boys to be inquisitive, you know.
%0%a001240
	All the souvenirs are really amazing. It's not surprising he's wandered off to look at them.
%0%a001250
	I'd be too worried about losing you to wander
	off anywhere.
Sancho
	I have the esame problem when %a001240, he was a young boy.
Sancho
	But %a001250, eshe always knows how to find her brother. Sí, those young days, they have esuch good memories for me.
Tuppence
	I hope the little nipper doesn't get lost or anything...
Bianca
	Sounds like he used to be a bit of a craftsman too in his day.
Nera
	I wonder what kind of things that craftsman used
	to make.
%0%a001240
	Wow! A real craftsman! That's amazing!
%0%a001250
	That old man had a twinkle in his eye. I'm sure he's still got the skills to make something even now.
Sancho
	Sí, sí. Thees señor, he ees the true artisan.
	He has esome kind of especial aura.
Tuppence
	I bet anyone who wanted to follow in that
	man's footsteps would have some serious
	training to do first.
Bianca
	It's nice to have a satisfied customer, eh?
Nera
	It's our job to create a museum that's never dull,
	so that people can come time and again and still
	enjoy it just as much as they did the first time.
%0%a001240
	Excellent! He loves our knick-knackatory. That means the way the exhibits are laid out must be good too.
%0%a001250
	It's because the exhibits are all so well-made. That's why it never gets boring, no matter how many times you look at them.
Sancho
	For the artisans, ees good to esee the work of the others. Ees a way to esharpen your eskills.
Sancho
	These exhibits you have collected, friend, they are esometheeng especial for these people.
Tuppence
	I'd rather see the work of the great craftswoman in the sky, personally. Works in Her own image, if you know what I mean!
Bianca
	It's hard gettin' good at somethin', no matter what
	it is.
Bianca
	The main thing is havin' the oomph to get back up and try again even when things en't gone well.
Nera
	That's such a good attitude. It's better to try again after a failure than to regret it later on.
%0%a001240
	I never give up on anything! I always stick at it to the end!
%0%a001250
	I hope one day we'll be able to put one of that man's creations on display here.
Sancho
	Mañana, mañana. Thees señor, he ees estill eso young. There ees muchos time for heem.
Tuppence
	I know how the poor chap feels. I had a terrible time of it when I was training to be a soldier.
Bianca
	The more customers the better as far as
	I'm concerned!
Nera
	What a waste, holing himself up down here when there are all those exhibits on display upstairs!
%0%a001240
	I would've thought it'd be harder to relax in the storeroom. It's so gloomy.
%0%a001250
	Oh! He scared me! I wasn't expecting anyone to be in the storeroom.
Sancho
	Esome people, they can relax here, esome people, they can relax there. But the storeroom...
	No, ees no for your Uncle Sancho.
Tuppence
	Surely there are better places to relax than the storeroom, aren't there?
Bianca
	I s'pose it's not often folk get a glimpse inside a museum storeroom, eh?
Nera
	Well, it's a good job we put some exhibits on display in the storeroom, isn't it?
%0%a001240
	It's great that people are looking at everything we've put on display, even the exhibits in the storeroom.
%0%a001250
	I suppose this is a good place if you just want
	to look at some exhibits without worrying about
	the crowds.
Sancho
	Thees room ees no the display room.
	Ees just the storeroom.
Sancho
	But thees señor, he no eseem to care.
Tuppence
	It's a bit of a waste to come all the way out here to the knick-knackatory and only see the exhibits in the storeroom, don't you think?
Bianca
	What a funny bloke! He seems more interested in
	how we've lined the exhibits up than the actual exhibits 'emselves!
Nera
	It's nice to know people share your tastes, isn't it, %a000090?
%0%a001240
	What do you think he means by ⓗinspiredⓘ?
	Does he like it or not?
%0%a001250
	Did you hear that, Dad? He thinks your displays are really good.
Sancho
	Sí. Ees true. You can change the way the exhibits look just by changing the places where they are on display.
Tuppence
	Different people certainly seem to react to the displays in different ways, don't they?
Bianca
	Blimey! Looks like talk of this place has reached all the way up to the heavens, eh?
Nera
	A Zenithian! What a great honour!
%0%a001240
	Do you think she flew here all the way from the Zenithian castle up in the sky? Wow!
	Having wings would be amazing!
%0%a001250
	If only I had wings, I could soar up into the sky and fly free for miles and miles.
Sancho
	Your knick-knackatory, eet ees famous now, My Majesty. The señores and señoras are coming from far and wide.
Tuppence
	If even she's heard the news that you're the new curator of the knick-knackatory, %a000090...
Tuppence
	Well, you can't spread a rumour much further than Zenithia, can you?
Bianca
	Yikes! Sounds like she's a bit peeved, eh?
Nera
	I suppose it is a bit of a serious sort of place for a honeymoon really.
%0%a001240
	That lady's really pretty, isn't she?
%0%a001250
