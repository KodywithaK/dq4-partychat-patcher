%0%a001240
	So is it different to the time you came before,
	or hasn't it changed much?
%0%a001240
	Oh. There used to be more faeries about?
	I wonder where they've all gone, then.
%0%a001240
	There only seem to be girl faeries.
	I feel like a bit of an intruder.
%0%a001250
	The faeries and the monsters all get along fine together here. That's the way it should be.
%0%a001250
	Is it always spring here? I'm sure that's not the
	only reason for the place having such a warm
	feel to it, though.
Sancho
	Uf! I always know thees quest of yours, eet ees hard, but I no theenk ees eso hard you must
	travel to the Realm of the Faeries.
Sancho
	But you know, ees no eso bad here, eh?
	Ees a very beautiful place.
Bianca
	It was the depths of winter when you came here as a boy, eh, %a000090? It's hard to imagine it now.
Bianca
	Thanks for bringin' me here.
	I always wanted to see the Realm of the Faeries.
Nera
	This place looks exactly like a picture I saw in a book once when I was a child.
Nera
	%0%a001250 seems to really like books. I'll have to find it and read it to her one day.
Nera
	Thank you, darling. I was just thinking how I'd love to visit the Realm of the Faeries.
Bianca
	Dwarfs make all kinds of things, eh? They're pretty impressive creatures by all accounts.
%0%a001250
	That slime looked really cute, don't you think?
%0%a001250
	I knew you'd agree, Dad!
	You see things like that.
%0%a001250
	Oh. You think all slimes look the same?
	That's weird.
Bianca
	It's funny to think that you came to a place like this all them years ago. I wish I could've come with you.
%0%a001240
	So you really did used to be a little boy.
	Does that mean Sancho was small once too?
Sancho
	Eh, friend! I no tell you then that you must
	estay eenside the town? But you come eso
	far away to thees place.
Sancho
	Qué? You come here from eenside our house!?
%0%a001240
	Is Treacle a friend of yours, Dad?
	I'd like to meet her if she is.
Tuppence
	Aah. Faeries really are rather sweet, aren't they?
Tuppence
	Aah. All of these faeries are just so
	incredibly sweet!
%0%a001240
	So she wasn't the queen, then?
%0%a001240
	So when we blow this horn, we get to meet the Queen? Will you let me blow it, Dad? Pleeease!
%0%a001250
	There are so many faeries here! Do you think I might be able to make friends with some of them?
%0%a001250
	Ooh, what a pretty horn! Is it some kind of musical instrument? I wonder what kind of music it plays.
Sancho
	Ees all connected, sí? You help esomeone een the past, and now they help you.
%0%a001240
	Did you hear that!? So there really is a Zenithian castle out there somewhere! We have to find it, Dad!
%0%a001250
	I'm not very good when it comes to heights. I should be okay in the castle, but I'm not too sure about the stairway...
Sancho
	Thees señorita ees eso young, but eshe rules thees place eso well.
Tuppence
	Mmm... Treacle. She really is terribly sweet.
%0%a001240
	Treacle's got such a lovely smile, and she's so friendly. I wonder if Mum's like her.
%0%a001240
	When you get the chance, will you tell me all
	about what happened here in the past? I really
	want to know!
%0%a001250
	Treacle's clothes are so beautiful. If only I could try on some clothes like that.
Sancho
	Thees señorita ees eso young, but eshe rules thees place eso well.
Sancho
	My Majesty, we no have anytheeng more to do here, no? Ees time to leave?
Tuppence
	Mmm... Treacle. She really is terribly sweet.
Bianca
	D'you think you're really supposed to climb up into the heavens to get to Zenithia?
Bianca
	I think it looks quite good floatin' about in the middle of the sky like it is at the minute, personally.
Nera
	It looks like we were wrong about peace being restored to the world just by the Zenith Dragon being resurrected.
%0%a001240
	Everybody wants peace, don't they? I'll do my best, as long as you stick by me, Dad.
%0%a001250
	Peace doesn't mean a world without monsters, right? Peace will be when we can all live together
	in harmony.
Sancho
	Anda! Everyone, they esay notheeng but peace, peace, peace. But ees no easy to find the peace, you know? 
Tuppence
	So the lovely Treacle is praying too! Ooh, I feel better already! I'm raring to go now!
%0%a001250
	I'm going to make friends with some faeries
	just like you have, Dad. And one day, we'll all
	go off adventuring together.
Sancho
	Ees amazing... You really came here when you were eso young, eh, friend?
Sancho
	Your father, señor Pankraz, he was also the escape artist when he was young, but ees
	notheeng compared to you!
Tuppence
	Your Majesty! You absolutely must introduce me to that delightful creature!
%0%a001240
	Was Honey a bit more chatty the last time you met her, Dad?
%0%a001240
	I'll bet she's being quiet now to show respect
	to Treacle.
%0%a001250
	Treacle... Honey... Sherbet...
	Faeries' names are all so sweet, don't you think?
Bianca
	There are all sorts of odd places dotted about the world, eh?
Nera
	You look a bit disappointed, darling. Was your last adventure with Honey really that much fun?
%0%a001240
	Do you think all of the faeries obey what the Queen says? If it were me, I'd probably sneak off there when no one was looking.
%0%a001250
	That's good, Dad. It's nice that Honey has good memories of your adventure together too.
%0%a001240
	Just the idea of staying the night in the Realm of the Faeries is really exciting!
%0%a001250
	We'd probably all have lovely dreams if we stayed the night here, don't you think, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I wish I could live in a room like this.
Bianca
	What's goin' on with that wall? The more times I look at it, the more odd it seems.
Nera
	We're inside a tree, and yet it's like being in the water. Just what you'd expect from a faerie's home, I suppose! Full of illusions.
%0%a001250
	The walls and the stairs are all watery!
	Faeries are so amazing!
%0%a001240
	The Faerie Palace is pretty deep into the woods,
	isn't it?
%0%a001250
	I really like being out in nature, with trees and water all around. It just makes me feel good.
Sancho
	You are like your father, sí? You no have the esense of rheethm and you no can esing, sí?
Sancho
	But thees horn, ees made by the faeries.
	Ees okay. Anyone, they can make eet work.
%0%a001240
	Everybody wants peace, don't they? I'll do my best, as long as you stick by me, Dad.
%0%a001250
	Peace doesn't mean a world without monsters, right? Peace will be when we can all live together
	in harmony.
Sancho
	Anda! Everyone, they esay notheeng but peace, peace, peace. But ees no easy to find the peace, you know? 
Bianca
	Where d'you think the feather came from?
	I didn't think faeries had wings.
Nera
	So faerie quills really do exist! I always thought they were just made up in books.
%0%a001240
	Hey, that's pretty cool. I reckon I might even be able to knuckle down and study if I had something like this to write with!
%0%a001250
	I can spell some really difficult words, you know,
	so you could let me use that quill sometime if
	you wanted.
Tuppence
	This must've been made by pulling a feather out of some poor creature's back. Dear me!
Bianca
	I get it. You have to use the quill with the right kind of ink, then.
%0%a001240
	Oh! I can't wait to have a go at using this quill!
%0%a001250
	Um, Dad, it might be better not to let %a001240 use the quill, you know.
%0%a001250
	It's just, he's always breaking normal pens, and they're much stronger. I don't know how he does it!
Bianca
	The walls and the stairs feel all watery, and
	yet you dun't get wet when you touch 'em.
	It's all very weird.
%0%a001250
	There's water everywhere, but it doesn't feel cold.
	I suppose that's because it's spring water. I mean, water in the spring!
Sancho
	I never get used to these floating estairs.
	The estairs, they must be firm, you know.
	Sí. Very, very firm.
Debora
	So this is the Realm of the Faeries. It's a bit remote, but it could be the perfect place for a faerie-like beauty such as myself.
Debora
	I remember Nera used to say how much she'd like to visit the Realm of the Faeries.
Debora
	Maybe we should bring her one day.
Debora
	I wonder if Zenithia will float up any higher into
	the sky.
Debora
	It's in such a state that I'm a bit worried it might come plummeting back down again.
Debora
	Papa was often quite hard work, and I'd say these faeries could be the same way from what I've seen.
Debora
	The palace itself is in the middle of a lake.
Debora
	These faeries certainly seem keen on water.
Debora
	What a pretty feather. I wouldn't mind having a fan made out of it.
Debora
	It's probably nice and cool here in summer with all this water around.
