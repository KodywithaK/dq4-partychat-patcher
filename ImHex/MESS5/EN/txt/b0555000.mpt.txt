	It dun't seem right somehow, havin' a big lookout tower like this next to a peaceful town.
Bianca
	If they feel the need for a big thing like this to keep watch, maybe Mostroferrato is in some kind of danger.
Nera
	This tower was built before I was born.
Nera
	All my father's told me is that he built the tower so we'd be prepared for monsters attacking.
	He never said anything more than that.

	I love high places. You can always see such a
	long way!
%0%a001250
	This sort of height isn't too scary...I think.
Bianca
	That Mr Briscoletti sounds like a bit of a worrier. I've never heard anythin' about Mostroferrato bein' a target for monsters.
Nera
	It hardly bears thinking about, but I suppose this lookout tower's a symbol of the possibility that monsters might actually attack us one day.
%0%a001240
	Mr Briscoletti is really nice to always worry about other people so much.
Bianca
	A man who turned himself into a monster? Is that even possible? I certainly hope not!
Nera
	When I was a little girl, I used to love climbing this tower so I could look out and imagine what life must be like in faraway towns and castles.

	Grandmaster Nimzo...
	Hm. I bet we'll end up having to fight him.
%0%a001250
	Um, Dad... Is it okay if we don't walk too close
	to the edge?
Sancho
	Ees notheeng! These estairs...ees notheeng!
	I no ⓚⓛ hahh ⓚⓛ even feel eet. Hahh hahh...
	Hahh...
Bianca
	Briscoletti must be really loaded to be able to afford to build a tower like this, eh?
Nera
	I can't seem to relax. I just have this feeling that something bad is about to happen.
%0%a001240
	Why do you think some people are so scared of heights? I don't get it. Heights don't bother me at all.
Bianca
	Sounds like we'd better get a move on, %a000090. What is it we have to do again?
Nera
	Please, darling. Do what you can to help Papa!
Bianca
	Why would he be waitin' at the tower?
	What d'you s'pose is so special about the place?
%0%a001240
	We'd better hurry up and tell Mr Briscoletti that the jar was red!
%0%a001250
	Do you think it's a bad sign that the jar was red? What's going to happen?
Sancho
	No eso fast! Hahh... Why you hurry?
	Ees ⓚⓛ hahh ⓚⓛ dangerous. Hahh...
	Eslow down, or maybe ⓚⓛ hahh ⓚⓛ you eslip, no?
Tuppence
	I wonder if Mr Briscoletti is at the tower because something's happened.
Bianca
	We have to try harder. If we dun't fight him off, Mostroferrato and Stockenbarrel will be in
	terrible trouble.
Nera
	I'd really like to do something to repay Papa for all he's done. We must try harder next time!
%0%a001240
	Do you think that monster's still lurking somewhere?
	We'll get him next time, right, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I've never seen a monster that big before. It's impossible to talk to him. He's really scary.
Sancho
	No eso fast! Hahh... Why you hurry?
	Ees ⓚⓛ hahh ⓚⓛ dangerous. Hahh...
	Eslow down, or maybe ⓚⓛ hahh ⓚⓛ you eslip, no?
Tuppence
	S-So we're going to f-fight him again...
	Dear Goddess! Please watch over us!
Bianca
	Well, we've put out the fire here, eh?
	Time to move on to the next crisis!
Nera
	This tower was built before I was born.
%0%a001240
	That monster was pretty big, wasn't he?
	He was even taller than this tower!
%0%a001250
	This sort of height isn't too scary...I think.
Tuppence
	I hope I become a man of sufficient means such that I can build a tower like this one day.
Bianca
	Briscoletti really cares about the townspeople, eh? That's why they all like him so much.
Nera
	I'm sure this tower will continue to keep the people of Mostroferrato safe, just like it always has.

Debora
	What are we doing at the tower?
	There's nothing to see here.
Debora
	Papa comes here from time to time.
	I wonder what for.
Debora
	It's just crazy talk saying that monsters will come and attack us one day. Papa's constantly worried about it. I suppose that makes him crazy!
Debora
	Ugh! I'd never want to turn myself into a monster. For one thing, monsters can't dress themselves up and look pretty.
Debora
	What are we doing here?
	This place is boring.
Debora
	I've never seen Papa like that before.
	We'd better hurry.
Debora
	Whatever is Papa doing hanging around here while other people are running around doing errands for him?
Debora
	I hope you weren't putting on a shoddy performance because you thought Papa was coming to help!
Debora
	There's nothing left for us to do here.
Debora
	He didn't build it to protect us against monsters in general, though. We know now that he had one specific monster in mind.
Debora
	Ugh! I'd never want to turn myself into a monster. For one thing, monsters can't dress themselves up and look pretty.
