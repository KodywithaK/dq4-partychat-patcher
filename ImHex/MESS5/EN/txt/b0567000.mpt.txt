Bianca
	This is a weird place, eh? It's really creepy seein' all them spots and speckles on the walls like that.
Nera
	You'd know this place was the underworld even without being told. There's such a nasty feeling
	in the air.
%0%a001240
	Look, Dad! Look at that weird tree!
%0%a001250
	I wonder who was allowed in the great dungeon. Humans? Monsters? Maybe even both?
Sancho
	Anda! Sí, I believe thees ees once the dungeon.
	Ees no a nice feeling een here.
Sancho
	I prefer we no come here.
Tuppence
	It feels like you'd end up cursed just from being inside the place! I'm sure that's not the case, though.
Bianca
	It's pretty big inside, eh?
Nera
	We mustn't let our guard down. We're in part of the underworld now, so we can't be sure what might happen.
%0%a001240
	Yuck! What a dirty, horrible place! And it smells.
	Don't monsters ever do any dusting?
%0%a001250
	Urgh! I just got a cobweb caught in my hair!
Sancho
	We must be careful, okay? You no know
	what might happen een a place like thees.
Tuppence
	Brrr... It's rather cold, considering that
	we're indoors.
Bianca
	I certainly never expected to hear talk of local souvenirs here in Nadiria too!
Nera
	Well! I didn't expect to hear talk of local souvenirs here in Nadiria.
%0%a001240
	It always makes me wonder when we speak to a restless armour... What do you think their real faces look like?
Bianca
	Pah! Well, he's just told us, so I suppose that makes him a dead man.
Nera
	Nimzo is a great god?
	Do you think that's really true?
%0%a001240
	Nimzo was a human!? Uh-oh! I've said it!
	...Oh, but I don't seem to have died or anything.
Tuppence
	N-Nimzo is h-hu... Oh! I can't say it! I'm too scared of what might happen!
%0%a001240
	What do you suppose he's thinking about?
	Do monsters play T 'n' T as well?
%0%a001250
	That rockbomb looked like he was really concentrating on something. Do you think he was planning a route around the T 'n' T board?
Bianca
	That dun't sound good! A mighty monster that even Nimzo couldn't defeat...
Nera
	So this monster's meditating? That probably
	means it's conserving its energy and preparing
	to take action.
%0%a001240
	Well, we'd better see to Nimzo first. We'll deal with this other monster when the time comes.
%0%a001250
	I wonder if the strange aura I've been feeling in the air since we came to Nadiria has been coming from that monster.
Sancho
	Your Uncle Sancho, he ees expecting thees,
	you know.
Sancho
	When we found out that thees Nimzo, he was once a human, I estart to theenk, ⓗthen where ees the true king of the monsters?ⓘ
Tuppence
	Well, here's hoping that nothing terrible happens, then.
Bianca
	It's nice of the monsters here to give us so many
	tips, eh?
Nera
	I wonder if he'll get into trouble for telling us things like that.
Nera
	I know it's not really our problem, but I can't help feeling a little bit worried for him.
Tuppence
	So the time's finally upon us. I suppose I'd better jot down my last will and testament.
Bianca
	I never expected them to have T 'n' T in Nadiria!
	D'you reckon the monsters play it too?
Bianca
	I s'pose the monsters must use T 'n' T tickets too.
	It's a bit hard to imagine, though.
Nera
	It's rather disconcerting seeing so many skeletons dotted about the place, isn't it?
Nera
	I adore Treasures and Trapdoors, but I don't think even I could enjoy a game in a place like this.
%0%a001240
	The T 'n' T board here looks pretty tricky.
%0%a001240
	Why do you suppose they've even got a T 'n' T board right in the middle of Mt Zugzwang, anyway?
%0%a001240
	Maybe it's to try and get us to let down our guard.
%0%a001250
	Oh! Don't disturb me now, Dad!
	I'm trying to plot a route around the board.
%0%a001250
	This place is a bit scary with all its ghosts
	and everything, but I still wouldn't mind a
	quick game of T 'n' T.
Sancho
	You believe thees place, ees just a normal Treasures and Trapdoors board? Oh, no, no. I no theenk eso.
Sancho
	My Majesty! Ees no a good time for playing the games. You no play here, okay?
Tuppence
	I'm always free for T 'n' T!
	...Or so I'd like to say, but I'm not too sure how I feel about a game in a place like this.
Tuppence
	It feels like this place is haunted by all those poor folk who were executed. I'm afraid it may be rather hard to concentrate on the game.
Debora
	The air out here doesn't look like it's very good for the skin. Can't we hurry up and go inside?
Debora
	It stinks a bit around here. Maybe it's best to pack perfume when you visit Nadiria.
Debora
	The ghoulroarer? Doesn't sound like much of
	a treasure to me. The last thing we need is a
	cursed souvenir.
Debora
	You don't need to worry. If the unthinkable happens, I'll put up a really spectacular tombstone for you.
Debora
	If the worst happens, I'll be counting on you, %a000090.
Debora
	Even if I thought I had what it takes, I don't find the idea of visiting a swamp overly appealing.
Debora
	This is a sinister-looking T 'n' T board. I'd rather go to the one on the Ventuno any day.
Debora
	Do you think the skeletons dotted about the place are of people who lost at T 'n' T?
