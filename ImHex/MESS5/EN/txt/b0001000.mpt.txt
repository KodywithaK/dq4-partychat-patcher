	Ah-phew, ah-phew.

	Zzzz... Aren't you that boy of Pankraz's...?
*: 
	Whatever are you doin' here? He'll be ever so worried about you.
*: 
	Zzzz...
Checkpoint Charlie
	The kingdom of Coburg is just on from here.
Checkpoint Charlie
	But a child of your age shouldn't be out alone at this hour of the night!
Checkpoint Charlie
	You hurry up and get yourself off home, boy.
~ The door is rusty and won't budge an inch. ~
Bianca
	Huh. What a pain! I hope there's some other way we can get inside.
*: 
	Oooh, you're awake now, are you?
*: 
	This castle is full of ghosts, I'll have yooo know. You must take care, little one. 
	Hoo hoo hoo!
~ The door is rusty and won't budge an inch. ~
~ The iron bars are heavy and impossible to move. ~
Bianca
	I dun't like the feel of this place.
	Stay close to me, okay, %a000090?
Bianca
	Waaah!
~ %0%a000090 examines the coffin. ~
~ There doesn't seem to be anything of note. ~
*: 
	............
*: 
	I seee yooo!
~ ............ ~
~ It's pitch black and impossible to see a thing. ~
~ It's like being trapped in some kind of ~
~ small space. ~
~ There's a heavy stone lid above %a000090's head. Try to move it? ~
~ %0%a000090 uses all of his strength to push the stone lid away. ~
~ There's an inscription carved into the tombstone. ~
~ It says something about it being %a000090's grave. ~
~ But %a000090 can't read very well, and isn't sure of the exact wording. ~
~ It's getting hard to breathe. It won't be long before %a000090 loses consciousness at this rate! ~
~ Try to move the stone lid above %a000090's head? ~

	Gooooood evenink to yooo.
	I am Miss Count of Uptaten Towers.
Miss Count
	Ten years ago now, ze people of my castle were attacked by ze monsters and killed.
Miss Count
	Vy did such thing happen, yooo ask?
Miss Count
	It is said that an evil being tries to take from ze vorld all children viz any status.
Miss Count
	But Count Uptaten and I are havink no children.
Miss Count
	And I believe zis angered ze monsters and made zem kill us all.
Miss Count
	Still, zere is no use in counting ze cost of it over and over. Vot's done is done. But...
Miss Count
	Yooo see, ve vooould like very much tooo rest in peace. I am hopink yooo vill be able tooo help us.
Miss Count
	Could yooo try tooo banish from zis old, derelict castle ze ghosts zat now live among us?
Miss Count
	If zese ghosts are not gone, ve people of ze castle are fated tooo forever dance upon zis cursed stage of limbo.
Bianca
	It's as dark as you like in here!
	Watch where you're walkin', eh, %a000090?
Count Uptaten
	Ooooooh! Yooo are ze first people tooo have ze courage tooo come zis far!
Count Uptaten
	Many years ago, zere came tooo zis castle ze ghosts whooo now live here.
Count Uptaten
	My vife, Miss Count, and I are finding it impossible tooo rest in peace.
Count Uptaten
	How zings have changed! I still remember ze days ve vould enjoy ze afternoooooon tea vile vatching ze flowers bloooooom.
Count Uptaten
	Please! I beg yooo! Banish from zis castle ze ringleader of zese ghosts. Zen ze rest vill follow vun by vun.
Count Uptaten
	Vunderful! I hoped I could count on yooo! Yooo are indeed very brave.
Count Uptaten

Count Uptaten

	I ask vun more time. Yooo vill help me, yes?
Count Uptaten
	Ooooooh! I have been vaiting a long time for someone to appear from zere.
Count Uptaten
	Vait! Zere is still somezing I must tell to yooo. Yooo young people must be more patient before yooo go runnink off!
Count Uptaten
	Zere is no use in yooo goink directly tooo ze throne roooooom now. It is tooo dark for yooo tooo see.
Count Uptaten
	Yooo must go throoough the grand hall tooo ze basement. In a jar in ze kitchen, yooo vill find

Count Uptaten
	Viz zis, yooo vill banish ze darkness and bring in ze light. Easy as vun, ha ha ha, twooo, ha ha ha, zree!
Count Uptaten

Count Uptaten

Count Uptaten
	Yooo must go throoough the grand hall tooo ze basement. In a jar in ze kitchen, yooo vill find
	a torch.
Count Uptaten
	Zis torch is sacred item I received once from queen of certain country.
Count Uptaten
	I zink ze spirits of dark vorld vill be afraid of ze light and it vill make zem disappear.
Count Uptaten
	Ooooooh! Yooo have ze torch! Vunderful!
Count Uptaten
	Now just climb ze stairs and find ze throne roooooom vere is vaiting ghost ringleader.
Count Uptaten
	His number vill soooooon be up!
*: 
	Oh dear. Oh dear, oh dear! It's not only ghosts, but spirits of the dark world Nadiria too!
*: 
	This must mean that Grandmaster Nimzo is extending his grip on our world. I read all about him in a book once!
*: 
	Ssss. I was supposed to be chief of the castle guards, but I couldn't protect the Count from those monsters.
*: 
	(sizzle sizzle) If only somebody, anybody, could stop the Grandmaster of Nadiria and bring peace back to our world!
*: 
	Wa ha ha! Dance! Dance!
	Dance your toes to the bone!
*: 
	Wa ha ha! The boss has found us a great place to rest our weary skulls!
*: 
	Dance! Dance an eternal dance and keep us entertained for evermore!
*: 
	Ugh. My stomach's empty.
*: 
	Huh. What's taking dinner so long?
	My mouth's dry as a bone here.
*: 
	I heard there's going to be a real
	feast tonight.
*: 
	Pah! Can't you put a bit more feeling into
	this dance?
*: 
	You'll make the food taste bad at this rate.
*: 
	I'm going to eat until my bones burst tonight!
*: 
	Mmmm. I smell the smell of tasty children!
*: 
	Wa ha ha! It won't be long before we're tucking in!
*: 
	I don't understand what's taking dinner so long! We'll have to go down and rattle some bones in the kitchen if it's much longer!
*: 
	Heeelp!
	Somebody make it stop!
*: 
	Aaargh! My legs!
	I can't make it stop!
*: 
	It's such a shame. The Count and Countess used to enjoy drinking tea from the most exquisite tea set.
*: 
	Now that lovely silver pot and cups are probably lying somewhere forgotten.
	What a terrible waste!
*: 
	The ghosts told us it was too boring watching us dance, so I suppose we're lucky in that respect.
*: 
	We should probably count our blessings, but it would be nice to be able to finally sleep
	in peace.
~ The door is rusty and won't budge an inch. ~
~ But then a warm breeze blows from out of nowhere. ~
~ The rusty door is open! ~
*: 
	Ssss. Welcome.
	Do you wish to stay the night?
*: 
	I wish you a warm and pleasant sleep.
*: 
	Very well.
	Perhaps next time (sizzle sizzle).
*: 
	Ssss. I came here looking for some sizzling hot treasure.
*: 
	I haven't found it yet, though. Ssss.
*: 
	Urgh! I think I'm going to be sick!
	I can't prepare a meal like this!
*: 
	The boss is going to bring out a special ingredient he's been saving.
*: 
	Can't you see I'm busy? Go away!
Bianca
	It's really dark.
	We'd better use the torch, %a000090.
~ %0%a000090 lights the torch. ~
~ A beautiful pale light illuminates the surroundings. ~
*: 
	Hah! You children are very brave coming
	this far!
*: 
	Why don't I cook you a nice, tasty dinner as a reward? Come with me!
*: 
	Perhaps I should mention...you're the main ingredient!
*: 
	You're not afraid of me, are you? Surely you're not such scaredy-cats if you've made it this far!
*: 
	Oh no! I couldn't possibly! I can't make a meal out of two poor children!
*: 
	It's just not a recipe I'm comfortable with!
*: 
	Do you want your neck sliced off by the scythe of hell!?
*: 
	No? Then I suggest you start preparing
	this meal!
*: 
	Yikes!
*: 
	Mmm. Smells good! I can hardly wait.
	Haul her up!
*: 
	Right away!
*: 
	Mmmm! This looks tasty!
*: 
	We'll be chewing this one down to the bone!
*: 
	Thank the Goddess! You're safe!
*: 
	I can't tell you how relieved I am.
	Now I'll be able to rest easy.
*: 
	What are you doing here!? I thought the skeletons would've made a meal of you by now!
*: 
	Well, if they can't stop their dinner running away, then maybe I should tuck in instead!
*: 
	H-Help! We'll leave the castle, I promise!
*: 
	If we all go, there won't be any more monsters coming here, I'm sure!
*: 
	We were forced out of Nadiria, you see. So we were just looking for somewhere nice to live.
*: 
	Surely you can forgive that? Right?
*: 
	Heh heh heh. Well, that's a relief.
	You'll grow up to be a fine young man, I'm sure.
*: 
	There's no need to be like that!
	Surely you can forgive us, boy!
Count Uptaten
	I knew I could count on yooo!
	I cannot zank yooo enough.
Miss Count
	Yes. Zank yooo so very much. Ve vere on tenterhooooooks, but now ve are so relieved. We can rest at last.
Miss Count
	Ze other castle inhabitants already are
	sleepink peacefully.
Count Uptaten
	Are yooo ready tooo depart, my dear?
Miss Count
	Yes, my darlink.
Miss Count
	Goooooodbye.
	Ve vill never forget yooo.
Bianca
	Well, that's good. Now the two of them can finally sleep peacefully together.
Bianca
	Those ghosts who took over this place were a nasty bunch, eh?
Bianca
	But it's the monsters who came along and killed all those poor innocent people who are the most to blame.
Bianca
	Oh! What's that? What a pretty ball!
Bianca
	I'll bet it's some kind of reward.
	We should take it with us.

*: 
	Brrrrr. I'm f-f-f-f-freezing! It's supposed to be s-s-summer before long. I don't g-g-get why it's
	so c-c-cold.
*: 
	There's a whole lot of funniness goin' on here in the village at the minute.
*: 
	I wonder if it's got anythin' to do with that odd fella who was here the other day.
*: 
	It's extremely dangerous outside of the village. You be a good boy now and go back home where you'll be nice and safe.
*: 
	My poor plants are really sufferin' here with this cold. I'm at my wits' end, I am.
*: 
	My poor plants are really sufferin' here with this cold. I'm at my wits' end, I am.
*: 
	Hey! Where did you get that stone, boy? Find it at the bottom of the well, did you?
*: 
	I went huntin' about in the cave back in my younger days, lookin' for some of them famous Whealbrook bluestones.
*: 
	Ah, yes. I remember pokin' about them big
	rocks hopin' for a sign of some ore. It doesn't
	half take me back.
*: 
	My poor plants are really sufferin' here with this cold. I'm at my wits' end, I am.
*: 
	This here's Whealbrook. We only ever get nice and friendly folk visitin' our village.
*: 
	Meow! Meow! Meow!
*: 
	You're Pankraz's son, if I'm not mistaken.
*: 
	This might just be hearsay, but it sounds like he's got an almighty enemy out there somewhere.
*: 
	If only you were more grown up, you'd be able to help him out.
*: 
	Hello. That's an interesting-looking gem you've got there.
*: 
	It's a gold orb, you say?
*: 
	May I have a closer look?
~ %0%a000090 hands over the gold orb. ~
*: 
	Wow. It's even prettier up close.
~ The man hands the gold orb back to %a000090. ~
*: 
	Erm, make sure you take good care of your father, okay?
*: 
	Oh, go on. It's not like I'm planning on stealing it or anything. You can trust me, I promise.
*: 
	No matter how hard things may get for you, keep your head held high and never give up.
	Remember that, okay?
*: 
	I don't suppose that splendid-lookin' fella is still standin' outside the church, is he, boy?
*: 
	Hm. What to do, what to do... I wonder if it's me he wants to see...
*: 
	Now that is odd. I could've sworn I'd put my sewin' box in the cupboard, and yet there it is on the chair.
*: 
	My mind must be playin' tricks on me.
*: 
	Dear me! I turn my head for a second, and come back to find the pot practically licked clean!
*: 
	The old man should just speak up if he's that hungry.
*: 
	I didn't eat it, I tell you!
*: 
	Honestly! That old dragon of a wife of mine treats me like a child sometimes!
*: 
	Hey! Someone's gone and written a weird message in my guest book. It wasn't you, was it, boy?
*: 
	You're that kid who likes caves, right?
	I'm the guard who was standin' in front of  Whealbrook Adit before.
*: 
	There's a funny fella in the village at the moment who's causin' quite a stir.
*: 
	He was standin' by the church last time I looked. You be careful of him, alright, boy?
*: 
	That's funny. I'm sure there was no glass here before.
*: 
	A lot of weird things seem to be happenin' just lately.
*: 
	Yikes! You can see me!?
*: 
	Yippee! At last, someone who can see me!
*: 
	Who am I?
	Tee hee! I might tell you, but not here.
*: 
	One of the houses here in the village has a room in the cellar.
*: 
	Come and meet me there. Race you!
*: 
	So you're Pankraz's son are you, boy?
*: 
	Come to think of it, I seem to remember there bein' a King Pankraz of somewhere or other once.
*: 
	Not that that has anythin' to do with your dad, of course!
*: 
	Now my old man's back, I've been able to open up the shop again. Maybe I could do you a deal?
Mr Rockefeller
	Ah! You're the young laddie from the cave aren't you, boy? You really helped me out of a tight spot back there.
Mr Rockefeller
	In fact, I'd say you deserve a reward!
	Have a look in that drawer just there.
Mr Rockefeller
	Has anyone ever told you that you've got really kind eyes? It's like magic.
	One look from you and my spirits soar!
*: 
	You came! But I beat you!
	My name's Honey. I'm a faerie!
Honey
	But our land ⓚⓛ our magical, faerie land ⓚⓛ is in terrible danger.
Honey
	That's why I was sent to the human world: to find help. But everyone here's been ignoring me.
Honey
	Tee hee hee! I even played a few tricks on people so they'd have to take notice of me.
Honey
	And it worked! See, you came aloⓚⓛ
Honey
	Ssh! Someone's coming!
Pankraz
	I was sure I heard voices down here, so I thought you must be playing with someone.
	But I see you're alone.
Pankraz
	Brrr. It's freezing down here. Stop talking to yourself and come upstairs before you catch a cold.
Honey
	Tee hee! It's true. No one else can see me!
Honey
	Anyway, will you come with me? To my land?
Honey
	Then Treacle will tell you everything.
Pankraz
	Good morning, %a000090!
	You were restless in the night.
	Did you have a bad dream?
Pankraz
	What? The faeries are in trouble?
	Ah ha ha! You're still half asleep, my lad!
Pankraz
	I've some things I need to look into, so I'll be staying in today. You go off and play. But stay in town, you hear?
Sancho
	Eh, friend. Why you looking eso esad, uh?
Sancho
	I know ees boring here, but your papá, he has important theengs he must do.
	You no get een hees way, okay?
*: 
	That's strange. The funny message in my guest book has disappeared.
*: 
	What in the world is goin' on!?
*: 
	There's a funny fella in the village at the moment who's causin' quite a stir.
*: 
	And there are rumours that there's someone bad out to get Pankraz.
*: 
	Make sure you watch your back, eh, boy?
*: 
	My old man found the glass he was after, but it doesn't look like the thing Pankraz is lookin' for is so easily found.
*: 
	I heard it was somethin' to do with a legendary hero or the like.
*: 
	Sorry! Listen to me, borin' a kid with grown-up stuff like that!
*: 
	Hello. That's an interesting-looking gem you've got there.
*: 
	It's a gold orb, you say?
*: 
	Do you mind if I have a closer look?
~ %0%a000090 hands over the gold orb. ~
*: 
	Wow. It's even prettier up close.
~ The man hands the gold orb back to %a000090. ~
*: 
	Erm, make sure you take good care of your father, okay?
*: 
	Oh, go on. It's not like I'm planning on stealing it or anything. You can trust me, I promise.
*: 
	No matter how hard things may get for you, keep your head held high and never give up.
	Remember that, okay?
*: 
	I saw that young lad who was in front of the church before headin' off towards the cave.
	I hope he's alright.
*: 
	Don't you think about goin' to dangerous places like that, d'you hear, boy?
*: 
	Pankraz seems nice and settled at the moment, but I suppose he'll be off on his travels again before long.
*: 
	It must be hard on you sometimes, boy, but you make sure you give him all the support he needs, alright?
*: 
	Dear, oh dear, oh dear! Not another empty pot!
*: 
	This is all very odd!
*: 
	I decided to have a feast. That's what the old dragon thought I'd done anyway, so I may as well get some pleasure out of the ear-bashin'!
Honey
	Sweet! You came!
	Come on, I'll take you to meet Treacle.
Honey
	I've brought a human warrior as you requested, Treacle.
Treacle
	My, what a cute little warrior he is too!
Honey
	N-No! He's not cute! He might look cute, but he's really not! I mean, he's reallyⓚⓛ
Treacle
	Alright, Honey, settle down!
	I can see his potential perfectly well.
Treacle
	It's %a000090, isn't it?
	Welcome to Faerie Lea, the soft and creamy home of the faeries.
Treacle
	I believe the reason you can see us faeries when other humans cannot is because you have a special power.
Treacle
	And so I have a favour to ask you, %a000090.
	Will you help me and my kind?
Treacle
	You see, one of our greatest treasures, the Herald of Spring, has been stolen.
Treacle
	It's a flute that we faeries use to summon spring in all its sweetness. Without it, the bitterness of winter will continue forever.
Treacle
	We need your help to get it back, %a000090. Will you help us recover the Herald of Spring?
Treacle
	You will? What sweet music to my ears!
Treacle
	I want you to go along with %a000090, Honey.
Honey
	Yes, Treacle!
~ Honey joins %a000090. ~
Treacle
	I hope you can help us, %a000090.
	You are our last chance!
Treacle
	I see...
	Well, I won't hold it against you. I'm not bitter.
Honey
	Why did you refuse Treacle?
	I thought you'd make a really brave warrior, but it looks like I was wrong.
*: 
	We faeries aren't strong enough to wield swords.
*: 
	We need your help, %a000090. That's why Treacle asked you. Please, do what she asks of you.
*: 
	The faeries are responsible for the passing of the seasons.
*: 
	If they can't summon spring, the winter will never end and the whole world will freeze.
*: 
	If you travel north from here, you'll reach the winter wasteland. They say there's a place called the Winter Palace there.
*: 
	But apparently its doors are always locked.
*: 
	Tee hee hee! You're the warrior Honey brought from the human world to get the Herald of Spring back!?
*: 
	Oh, my! Er...I heard that the thief who stole it fled to the Winter Palace. Good luck!
*: 
	The view from here in springtime is breathtaking.
*: 
	Treacle's far too soft, if you ask me.
*: 
	How can faeries and humans live together in peace, let alone monsters?
*: 
	It's because of Treacle that we're stuck in this endless winter without a flute.
*: 
	I know where he went. That thief ran away north with Treacle's precious Herald of Spring.
*: 
	Treacle's really warm and kind.
*: 
	And gooey too. That's a compliment from a slime, you know. She let me live here in Faerie Lea, even though I'm a monster.
*: 
	Aaaah!
	Th-That's a great sabrecat!
*: 
	I know it's only a young cub, but even so...
	I've never heard of anyone befriending a sabrecat. They come straight from hell!
*: 
	Oooh, that's good! Nothing like a bath.
	You can feel the heat right down to your bones.
*: 
	You're new here, are you? Have you heard about the dwarf who lives in a cave over to the west?
*: 
	You have? You're very well informed.
*: 
	Apparently he was ousted from Faerie Lea when he wrote a book about thieving and locks. ⓗLots about Locksⓘ it was called.
*: 
	If Treacle had been in charge back then, it wouldn't have been such a bone of contention. Poor dwarf.
*: 
	I don't know. I hardly get a single customer these days. So then, how does this go again...?
*: 
	It wasn't my idea! Dwight went off on his own. I knew nothing about it.
*: 
	I don't know where he got the idea that it was Treacle who chucked me out of Faerie Lea.
*: 
	I-I'm sorry about all this. I don't suppose you'd be interested in my book, ⓗLots about Locksⓘ, would you? To make up for Dwight's behaviour...
*: 
	It's shut away in a treasure chest right at the bottom of this cave.
*: 
	And if you come across Dwight, set him straight for me, would you?
*: 
	It wasn't my idea! Dwight went off on his own. I knew nothing about it.
*: 
	I don't know where he got the idea that it was Treacle who chucked me out of Faerie Lea.
*: 
	I-I'm sorry about all this. I don't suppose you'd be interested in my book, ⓗLots about Locksⓘ, would you? To make up for Dwight's behaviour...
*: 
	Oh! You've already absorbed its wisdom, I see.
*: 
	Well anyway, if you come across Dwight, set him straight for me, would you?
*: 
	So, you're a master of all that ⓗLots about Locksⓘ has to teach now, are you?
*: 
	It's not every door you'll be able to open, but you shouldn't have any trouble with simple locks.
*: 
	By the way, if you come across Dwight on your travels, set him straight for me, would you?
*: 
	Ooh! A gooman and a faerie!
*: 
	I'm not a bad slime. Really, I'm not.
	I wouldn't just goo off with the Herald of Spring. It was Dwight.
*: 
	Heh heh heh. You lookin' for that ⓗLots about Locksⓘ book an' all?
*: 
	Well you may as well go 'ome, then.
	You ain't gonna get it before me, mate!
*: 
	Heh heh heh. You lookin' for that ⓗLots about Locksⓘ book an' all?
*: 
	Eh? Gordon Bennet! You got it already?
*: 
	Hmph! Better watch yer back, mate. I'm like an elephant, me. I pack a mean trunk!
	Er, no... I mean, I never forget nuffin'!
~ %0%a000120 opens the treasure chest. ~
~ There's a book entitled ⓗLots about Locksⓘ inside! ~
~ A strange aura radiates from the book and envelops %a000090... ~
~ %0%a000090 magically absorbs the wisdom from the pages of ⓗLots about Locksⓘ! ~
~ As the aura fades away, the book disintegrates into thin air... ~
*:
