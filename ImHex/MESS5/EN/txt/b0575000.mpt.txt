Nera
	I really love the baths here. I wish I could have
	a nice, relaxing soak now, but there's just not
	enough time.
%0%a001240
	These baths are basically just lakes full of hot water. I know my stuff, see!
%0%a001250
	Stockenbarrel. What a sweet little name for a sweet little village.
Bianca
	I can hardly tell him I en't bin by because I spent all them years as a statue, eh?
Bianca
	The really good baths dun't just heal your body. They heal your mind too.
Bianca
	Not that we've got time for either at the minute, mind.
%0%a001240
	These baths are basically just lakes full of hot water. I know my stuff, see!
%0%a001240
	Bianca! It's funny to hear Mum being called by her name like that. She's always just ⓗMumⓘ to me.
%0%a001250
	Stockenbarrel. What a sweet little name for a sweet little village.
Tuppence
	Mmm, this village is definitely to my liking. I can almost smell the beautiful girls in the air!
%0%a001250
	It's nice to be able to laze about in the sun. That cat certainly seems to be enjoying it, anyway.
Bianca
	That bloke may moan, but what his son's doin' is probably a big help.
Nera
	Ooh! A priest. I probably would've become a
	nun myself, if I hadn't had Rodrigo Briscoletti
	for a father.
%0%a001240
	I thought all kids were supposed to end up doing the same job as their fathers!
%0%a001240
	Does this mean I don't have to become king, and
	that I could be a trader or a priest or something totally different?
Sancho
	For the travellers like you and me, ees good
	to have more churches, sí? But ees esad for
	thees señor.
Tuppence
	Children do tend to surpass their parents in their endeavours. I'm a prime example, obviously!
Bianca
	That cat's not exactly a pet of ours, but it seems to like hangin' around our place all the time.
Bianca
	Come to think of it, I wonder how %a001210's
	gettin' along.
Nera
	I wonder if this cat belongs to Bianca.
	It really is very sweet.
%0%a001250
	I really like this place.
	There are lots of cute little cats.
Bianca
	He dun't change, eh? Not that I'm complainin'
	or nothin'.
Nera
	Dear me, darling! I thought we were supposed to be in a hurry, and yet there you go taking a bath!
Nera
	But I suppose, now we're here...
Nera
	Aaah! That does feel good.
%0%a001240
	Wow! Look at all that steam! It's totally white!
%0%a001250
	We're outside...and yet people are having a bath!
	Is it really a bath? What fun!
Sancho
	Anda! Maybe we are een the way of esometheeng, no? Ees too esteamy een here for you!
%0%a001240
	Is the old man really young? He seems a bit wrinkly to me, but is he not actually old?
Bianca
	Fancy a character like him bein' in a place like this! The world's in a sorry old state, eh?
%0%a001240
	He's a quick one at getting away.
%0%a001240
	We'll make him pay when we catch up with him, though. No one causes trouble in my mum's village!
%0%a001250
	That was a bit of a shock! What was someone like him doing here?
Sancho
	We no know who or where thees señor, he estole thees from. You must keep eet unteel we find out who ees the owner.
Tuppence
	Are you alright, %a000090?
	You're not injured, I hope?
Bianca
	What are we doing here at a time like this, %a000090?
Bianca
	Comin' back to this place makes me feel all nostalgic for the past, y'know.
Bianca
	I didn't much care for this place when we first moved here.
Bianca
	I dun't know when my feelins changed, but I really love it here now.
Nera
	Don't worry about me. I don't mind at all if you'd like to go and see how Bianca is doing.
Nera
	You were childhood friends after all, so I know she means a lot to you.
Nera
	This village is so lovely and quiet. Blissful!
%0%a001240
	I love climbing trees! Can I climb up, Dad?
%0%a001240
	Mmm...
%0%a001240
	The air here smells amazing!
%0%a001240
	This place feels all familiar for some reason.
%0%a001250
	The forest is talking, you know. The trees are saying hello. They're all so friendly!
%0%a001250
	Ooh! Did you see that squirrel jump out on the branch of that tree just then?
Sancho
	Ees eso high een the mountains. Sí, señor Whitaker, he must have a very hard life.
Sancho
	I no know anytheeng about thees place unteel you tell me about eet, friend.
Tuppence
	The view's not so great, but I suppose that's to be expected, considering we're in the middle of all these mountains.
Bianca
	The bloke here's the one who made the veil for the weddin', eh?
Bianca
	It wasn't half pretty. I had no idea he could make somethin' so lovely.
Nera
	That wonderful veil I wore at our wedding was made here, wasn't it?
Nera
	It's funny. He doesn't seem like the kind of fellow to take on work like that, and yet he made such a lovely job of it.
%0%a001240
	Wow! A shop and a house inside a cave! That's cool!
%0%a001250
	Look, Dad. Look at all those flowers.
%0%a001250
	Do you think the man put them all on display?
	What a nice thing to do.
Bianca
	Y-You didn't, did you, %a000090?
Bianca
	Nah, I'm sure it weren't you, really. Ha... Ha ha ha!
Nera
	Dear me! What a terrible thing for someone to do!
%0%a001240
	I wouldn't mind a nice, long soak myself.
Tuppence
	What despicable creature would steal clothes from a poor vulnerable young woman like that?
Tuppence
	If only I'd arrived here sooner. Why, I'd take that scoundrel and beat him to a pulp!
Bianca
	It's a bit of a pain havin' to traipse past the inn to get to the baths.
Bianca
	But they're the ones takin' care of them, so I s'pose it's fair enough.
Nera
	What a lovely inn this is, with the baths nearby and everything. It's certainly nice and relaxing.
%0%a001240
	I always get really excited when we come to an inn. I suppose that means I'm cut out for travelling, doesn't it?
Bianca
	That old woman's bin like a mother to me ever since Mum died.
%0%a001240
	Are you alright, Dad? You got quite a whacking on your back there.
Sancho
	You know thees señora, friend?
Sancho
	Why you no tell me before we came here?
	Then I could prepare esome nice geeft for her. Maybe a paella, eh?
Nera
	She's right, darling. There were all those years you couldn't go anywhere, after all.
Nera
	I feel so guilty for making Bianca and our children and other people so worried about us.
%0%a001250
	Um, have you got a few secrets, Dad?
	...It's okay. Never mind.
Sancho
	You know thees señora, friend?
Sancho
	Why you no tell me before we came here?
	Then I could prepare esome nice geeft for her. Maybe a paella, eh?
Bianca
	There's somethin' about goin' into a pub durin' the day. It always seems quieter than everywhere else, dun't you think?
Nera
	I'm surprised to find a pub in a small village like
	this. I suppose it's a good place for people to relax after work.
%0%a001240
	Why are pubs always so dark?
	Is it no fun if they're bright?
%0%a001250
	Pubs smell of drink even during the daytime,
	don't they?
Sancho
	Heh heh heh! You esee all thees dreenks?
	Ees a collection for the lovers of the alcohol.
	Sí, sí. Ees a fine collection.
Bianca
	Hopefully there won't be any more folk gettin' taken in like that now we've seen off Korol, eh?
Nera
	I can still hear the followers' voices ringing in
	my ears as they prayed. What a terrifying place that was.
%0%a001240
	What did it say? The handwriting was a bit messy, so I couldn't figure it out.
%0%a001250
	It's naughty to graffiti things like that!
Bianca
	That scintillating sinter he was on about is the crystal deposits left behind in the bath water. It's all natural stuff, and there's not a lot of it.
Bianca
	It's the most famous thing about Stockenbarrel by far.
%0%a001240
	I get the feeling that man isn't a very nice character.
%0%a001240
	Why did he panic like that when he saw Mum?
%0%a001250
	What could he be doing down a dark well like this?
	Do you think he's trying to hide?
Nera
	Oh yes. Stockenbarrel is famous for its
	scintillating sinter.
Nera
	I think it's quite a valuable thing, in fact. I wonder if that man's from around these parts. It doesn't seem like he is.
%0%a001240
	I get the feeling that man isn't a very nice character.
%0%a001250
	What could he be doing down a dark well like this?
	Do you think he's trying to hide?
Bianca
	Huh! No wonder it's bin so tricky findin' any scintillatin' sinter lately. That bloke's got it all!
Nera
	Scintillating sinter has a lovely distinct smell to it.
%0%a001250
	So this is scintillating sinter? Are you supposed to put it in the bath or something?
Tuppence
	Those desert roses were two a penny.
	Who'd have thought you could exchange
	them for scintillating sinter?
Tuppence
	I wonder what we could exchange the
	scintillating sinter for. Or should we just
	quit while we're ahead?
Bianca
	If he's that fussed about the outside world,
	then why dun't he get out of this well?
Bianca
	Maybe that's why he was after the scintillatin' sinter all the while.
Nera
	I could be wrong, but is that fellow stuck down here, do you think?
%0%a001240
	Um, Dad... What's that man got to do with Mum?
%0%a001250
	You and Mum were childhood friends, weren't
	you, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I hope she's okay. I wish we could find her soon.
Tuppence
	You're not just old friends, you're her husband!
Tuppence
	Hmm. I think he might have a bit of a thing for Bianca, you know. That's probably why he's burying his head in the sand.
Bianca
	I didn't imagine so many folk would be worried about me. I hope nothin' like that ever happens again.
%0%a001250
	Don't leave us again, will you, Mum?
Bianca
	Of course I won't, %a001250.
	Dun't you worry.
Bianca
	Runnin' an inn is a tough old job.
Bianca
	Tryin' to keep all the customers happy is a
	never-endin' task.
%0%a001240
	It sounds like Grandpa's having a few problems.
	Do you think we should try and do something to
	help out?
Nera
	How nice of him to give us a wedding present!
%0%a001240
	What did you get? A seed of magic? Nice!
Nera
	If he's training to run an inn, it must be jolly
	hard work.
%0%a001240
	I'm not very good at learning things either. %0%a001250 always picks things up faster than I do.
Tuppence
	I know that feeling! Oh, I know that feeling so well.
Tuppence
	He and I could probably bend each other's ears all night long if we had the chance. Yes, I certainly know how he feels.
Bianca
	Dad seems to have aged a bit while I've bin away.
Bianca
	Hopefully we'll be able to finish everythin' off before long so that I can take better care of him.
%0%a001240
	He's Mum's dad. That makes him my grandad, right?
%0%a001240
	Grandpa Whitey... He's got a nice smiley face. 
%0%a001250
	Grandpa must be all lonely when we're off on our travels. We should pay him a visit more often.
Sancho
	Señor Whitaker, he ees eso much older than I remember. Sí, your Uncle Sancho, he gonna have the wrinkly eskin of the alligator too, you know.
Nera
	Everybody seems to love Bianca, don't they?
Nera
	He he. You look a bit worried, darling. Bianca really plays on your mind, doesn't she?
%0%a001240
	So he's learning how to run the place? There must be loads of things he has to remember for that!
Nera
	So that's Bianca's father. He seems rather
	run-down.
Nera
	Hopefully we'll bring peace to the world before long, and then he'll be able to relax more.
Sancho
	Señor Whitaker, he ees eso much older than I remember. Sí, your Uncle Sancho, he gonna have the wrinkly eskin of the alligator too, you know.
Nera
	So that's Bianca's father. He seems rather
	run-down.
Nera
	Hopefully we'll bring peace to the world before long, and then he'll be able to relax more.
%0%a001240
	It's weird meeting people who know you from
	before, Dad.
%0%a001250
	He seems like a nice old man.
Sancho
	Señor Whitaker, he ees eso much older than I remember. Sí, your Uncle Sancho, he gonna have the wrinkly eskin of the alligator too, you know.
Nera
	Bianca's as pretty as ever.
Nera
	It doesn't seem like she's married yet, though.
%0%a001240
	She's really pretty. You were friends with her when you were little, weren't you, Dad?
%0%a001240
	I wonder what my mum's like.
	I hope I get to meet her soon.
%0%a001250
	Um, Dad... That girl and you...
	Er, never mind.
Sancho
	Uf! Ees, ees señorita Bianca!
	She ees eso, eso beautiful now.
	Heh heh. Ees, ees no a bit hot een here?
Tuppence
	Whatever is a beautiful girl like her doing all alone? Maybe I should take her on.
Tuppence
	Yikes! Now there's a look that could kill, %a000090! I was only joking. There's no need to get your knickers in a twist.
%0%a001250
	The cat seems happy enough.
	I'm pretty sleepy, though.
Bianca
	Charmin'! He dun't seem to have noticed we're here
	at all!
Nera
	There are actually quite a few people about, and yet he doesn't seem to feel at all self-conscious about washing his back like that.
Nera
	I could wash your back if only we had the place to ourselves. It's so nice and muscular!
%0%a001240
	Can I have a splash about too?
	(splish splash)
%0%a001250
	I like having a bath, but I'm sleepy now, so I'm afraid I might drown! Glug...glug... Ha!
Sancho
	Ees a nice bath. But maybe ees nicer eef ees no eso noisy, eh?
Bianca
	We can't hang about too much, but it is dark now, after all. Maybe we should stay here the night?
Bianca
	I didn't much care for this place when we first moved here.
Bianca
	I dun't know when my feelins changed, but I really love it here now.
Nera
	Don't worry about me. I don't mind at all if you'd like to go and see how Bianca is doing.
Nera
	You were childhood friends after all, so I know she means a lot to you.
Nera
	This village is so lovely and quiet. Blissful!
%0%a001240
	Wow! Look at all those stars!
%0%a001240
	There's loads more than you ever see in Gotha.
	Look, Dad! They're amazing!
%0%a001240
	Mmm...
%0%a001240
	The air here smells amazing!
%0%a001240
	This place feels all familiar for some reason.
%0%a001250
	The forest is talking, you know. The trees are saying hello. They're all so friendly!
%0%a001250
	It's so...quiet here...
	It's making me...(yawn)...feel all...sleepy.
Sancho
	Ees eso high een the mountains. Sí, señor Whitaker, he must have a very hard life.
Sancho
	I no esure eef ees the monsters or being up een the mountains, but I no feel esafe.
	Ees time we rest for today.
Tuppence
	Aaah, I must admit that I'm rather tired. Perhaps we could find ourselves a bed for the night before too long, %a000090?
Bianca
	Looks like the Order of Zugzwang got their dirty mitts on this place too, eh?
Nera
	I'm starting to feel rather agitated now.
	We should hurry to Nadiria, darling.
%0%a001250
	What does he mean by the hard sell?
Sancho
	The Order of Zugzwang!? Here?
	I no believe eet!
Bianca
	The bloke here's the one who made the veil for the weddin', eh?
Bianca
	It wasn't half pretty. I had no idea he could make somethin' so lovely.
Nera
	That wonderful veil I wore at our wedding was made here, wasn't it?
Nera
	It's funny. He doesn't seem like the kind of fellow to take on work like that, and yet he made such a lovely job of it.
%0%a001240
	Wow! A house inside a cave! That's so cool!
%0%a001250
	Look, Dad. Look at all those flowers.
%0%a001250
	Do you think the man put them all on display?
	What a nice thing to do.
Bianca
	Ha ha! There you go again, tryin' to speak to folk when they're sleepin'! You're a funny one sometimes, %a000090.
Nera
	He really is fast asleep. It must be tiring work trying to grow things day in day out.
%0%a001240
	Why's he on the edge like that? It's good that
	there's a church and everything, but I can't help feeling a bit bad.
Sancho
	No! You no wake heem up!
	He needs to have a siesta esometime, no?
Bianca
	Looks like she's come to have a bath. It's nice that she can relax like that.
Nera
	Don't you think it's rather strange to be watching an old woman sleep? You could pick a more normal hobby, you know!
%0%a001240
	She didn't seem to be snoring too much.
%0%a001250
	I wouldn't mind a sleep now either.
Bianca
	Thanks for always takin' care of things about
	the place.
Bianca
	Hm? Oh, nothin'. I was just sayin' a few words of thanks to that man there, that's all.
Nera
	I do hope Bianca will live happily ever after too.
Bianca
	Why are you lookin' at me like that, %a000090?
Bianca
	There's nothin' I can do about it. It's up to him to figure out how he feels, not me!
Nera
	You look a bit troubled, darling. I think we're probably experiencing the same emotion...
%0%a001240
	Why do you have to make people forget about other people? I don't get it!
%0%a001250
	She sounds very determined, doesn't she?
Tuppence
	You can have me if he doesn't want you, dear!
Tuppence
	Hmph! She's not listening.
Bianca
	It's hard to tell whether he was bein' serious or whether he was jokin', eh?
Nera
	But his face is all wrinkly too!
%0%a001240
	I get like that if I stay in the bath too long too.
%0%a001250
	He smells of drink. Can we get away from
	him, please?
Bianca
	The cheek of it! She's waitin' up worryin' about him, and he's talkin' about her like that!
Nera
	Do you think his wife is really all that scary?
%0%a001250
	Yuck! Drunk people are horrible!
Sancho
	No, no, no. Thees ees no good.
	You must no dreenk for courage.
Sancho
	Your Uncle Sancho, he no have a wife.
	I no know about the life weeth another.
Sancho
	But I know about the housework and I know how to turn a boy eento a macho man, sí?
Bianca
	I dun't blame her. Look at the state of him!
Nera
	I do hope I never have to shout at you like she's going to shout at her hubbie when he gets home.
Nera
	I suppose that means you'll just have to make sure you never do anything that warrants any shouting. He he he!
%0%a001240
	Is that man's wife going to tell him off? How funny!
Bianca
	That little one's always asleep here of a night. I wonder what it is about our house that it likes so much.
%0%a001250
	Look at him all curled up in a ball! How cute!
Debora
	There's hardly anything here apart from the baths, is there?
Debora
	Don't they have the brains to figure out they
	could use them to sell the place as a tourist attraction?
Debora
	I've never been able to get on with the atmosphere in churches and the like.
Debora
	Nera did well to stay at the abbey all those years. There's no way I could've managed it.
Debora
	Oh, that cat's so charming and friendly!
	Two of my own qualities, I might add.
Debora
	The cheek of it! I know it's steamy and hard to see, but I still look nothing like an ⓗold girlⓘ!
Debora
	You wouldn't have thought you'd have to put up with his sort in a quiet little place like this. What is the world coming to?
Debora
	I wonder who he stole that from.
	You'd better hang onto it, %a000090.
Debora
	This is where that childhood friend of yours lives, isn't it, %a000090?
Debora
	You can drop in on her briefly if you want.
	I won't be angry, don't worry.
Debora
	Now we've come all this way, I may as well try out the baths. It's good to relax from time to time.
Debora
	Really? He made the veil for my wedding dress?
Debora
	Come to think of it, I do remember being told something along those lines. I was too busy to think about it at the time.
Debora
	Don't worry. I know it wasn't your doing, so you don't have to look so panicky.
Debora
	If you stay at this inn, you can go in the baths whenever you want, can't you?
	We'll stay here tonight.
Debora
	We couldn't have come even if we'd wanted to.
	It's a bit tricky to travel when you've been turned
	to stone.
Debora
	I'm a bit surprised to see a pub in such a small village. I suppose it's for the bath-goers.
Debora
	If the world stays in chaos for too long, then another silly cult might spring up in Zugzwang's place.
Debora
	Scintillating sinter is a famous local speciality,
	if I remember rightly.
Debora
	It doesn't sound like he's from around here, though. He's a bit of a dodgy character, I'd say.
Debora
	There is a lovely smell coming off the baths, actually. I wonder if that's the scintillating sinter.
Debora
	Why doesn't he just get out of the well then?
	Or is he stuck? Too weak to climb out on his own?
Debora
	I suppose he can't ask anyone for help if he is, though, what with being here picking scintillating sinter on the sly.
Debora
	He's right about it being late.
	This is why I alwaysⓚⓛ
Debora
	Never mind, %a000090. Forget it.
	Just pretend I didn't say anything.
Debora
	So, are you happy to meet up with your old friend again, %a000090?
Debora
	I see... Well, that's good. And it's good that she
	seems well.
Debora
	Just tell me the truth! I won't be angry. I can see you're happy, it's written all over your face.
Debora
	Bianca's father seems to have let his exhaustion get the better of him.
Debora
	I suppose he's worried about her.
	I can understand that.
Debora
	Bianca's father seems to have let his exhaustion get the better of him.
Debora
	I suppose he's worried about her.
	I can understand that.
Debora
	Bianca hasn't changed a bit.
Debora
	I wonder if it's the baths that have kept her looking so young.
Debora
	You've got more wounds, haven't you?
Debora
	It doesn't look good for me if you're the only one injured, you know. Do you want people to think I'm bullying you?
Debora
	Hm? What was that?
	I couldn't quite hear you.
Debora
	Hmm, you really are incredibly clumsy.
Debora
	You'll have to be a bit more careful when you fight
	in future.
Debora
	We may as well stay the night now we're here.
	I think I'll have a bath before bed.
Debora
	The stars are beautiful, aren't they?
	Almost as beautiful as me.
Debora
	So that no-good cult even managed to extend its influence here.
Debora
	Looks like we don't have time to relax here.
	We need to hurry to Nadiria.
Debora
	Really? He made the veil for my wedding dress?
Debora
	Come to think of it, I do remember being told something along those lines. I was too busy to think about it at the time.
Debora
	He's fast asleep. We won't be very popular if we wake him, so let's get out of here.
Debora
	You'll wake her up if you get too close!
	Come away!
Debora
	I wonder how long this man will carry on messing about. He needs to take the bull by the horns!
Debora
	How interesting. You probably sympathise with people who have those kind of feelings towards Bianca, don't you, %a000090?

Debora
	He must be the dominant one if he's here drinking while his wife's waiting at home. Not like you.
Debora
	I wouldn't get angry like that if you ever had too much to drink. I'd just forbid you from ever
	drinking again!
Debora
	I doubt I'll ever need to, though.
Tuppence
	Mmm, this village is definitely to my liking. I can almost smell the beautiful girls in the air!
Debora
	Are you implying that there are girls here more beautiful than my good self, Tuppence?
Tuppence
	Er, I, er, no! Absolutely not!
	You're the fairest of them all, without a doubt!
Tuppence
	I know that feeling! Oh, I know that feeling so well.
Tuppence
	But I must admit I'm rather envious. It can't be such a hardship doing your training with a beautiful lady close by.
Debora
	Envious, are you, Tuppence?
	Am I no longer beautiful enough for you?
Tuppence
	I, er, I mean... Of course you are! I'm thrilled to be accompanying you.
Tuppence
	Mmm, this village is definitely to my liking. I can almost smell the beautiful girls in the air!
Debora
	Are you implying that there are girls here more beautiful than my good self, Tuppence?
Tuppence
	Er, I, er, no! Absolutely not!
	You're the fairest of them all, without a doubt!
