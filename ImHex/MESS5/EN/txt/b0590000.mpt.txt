	It dun't seem right somehow, havin' a big lookout tower like this next to a peaceful town.
Bianca
	If they feel the need for a big thing like this to keep watch, maybe Mostroferrato is in some kind of danger.
Nera
	This tower was built before I was born.
Nera
	All my father's told me is that he built the tower so we'd be prepared for monsters attacking.
	He never said anything more than that.
Bianca
	That Mr Briscoletti sounds like a bit of a worrier. I've never heard anythin' about Mostroferrato bein' a target for monsters.
Nera
	It hardly bears thinking about, but I suppose this lookout tower's a symbol of the possibility that monsters might actually attack us one day.
Bianca
	A man who turned himself into a monster? Is that even possible? I certainly hope not!
Nera
	When I was a little girl, I used to love climbing this tower so I could look out and imagine what life must be like in faraway towns and castles.
Debora
	What are we doing at the tower?
	There's nothing to see here.
Debora
	Papa comes here from time to time.
	I wonder what for.
Debora
	It's just crazy talk saying that monsters will come and attack us one day. Papa's constantly worried about it. I suppose that makes him crazy!
Debora
	Ugh! I'd never want to turn myself into a monster. For one thing, monsters can't dress themselves up and look pretty.
