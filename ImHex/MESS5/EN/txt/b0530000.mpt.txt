%0%a001240
	Yippee! It's Dad! It's Dad! It's Dad!
%0%a001240
	You look quite a lot like me, Dad.
%0%a001250
	We knew you'd probably be tired, so we decided to leave you be until you woke up.
%0%a001250
	There's so much we want to talk about with you!
%0%a001250
	It's been a long time since you were last here in the castle, hasn't it, Dad? But don't worry, I can show you around.
%0%a001240
	Don't worry about her, she always bursts into tears at the drop of a hat.
%0%a001240
	ⓗPrince %a001240 can climb that pillar all by himself (sob).ⓘ ⓗPrince %a001240 can break chairs (sob).ⓘ You know the kind of thing.
%0%a001250
	%0%a001240 always plays pranks on her and tries to give her a fright one way or another.
%0%a001250
	I nearly had a heart attack once when I heard
	her shrieking about him walking along the edge
	of the veranda.
Tuppence
	A lowly soldier like me in the great %a000090's bedroom, of all places! The thought of it makes me go weak at the knees.
%0%a001240
	The people of Gotha treat you like some kind of idol, Dad! Isn't that amazing?
%0%a001250
	People really were on tenterhooks waiting for you to come back. That's why we tried so hard to find you as fast as we could.
%0%a001240
	You've never been to Grandma's birthplace
	have you, Dad?
%0%a001240
	Neither have I. So I was thinking that maybe it'd be fun if we could go together!
%0%a001250
	We wanted to visit Lofty Peak, but we had to find you first, Dad.
%0%a001250
	We knew you'd definitely want to go with us to Grandma's birthplace.
%0%a001240
	Uncle Bertie's really kind. He always gives us secret stashes of sweets.
%0%a001250
	Uncle Bertie really wants grandchildren, but Cousin Gertie says she's never getting married.
%0%a001250
	It's all a bit of a puzzle, really.
Sancho
	Sí, ees true...
	Everytheeng, eet estarts when señor Pankraz, he was lost and he estumbled upon Lofty Peak.
Tuppence
	Prince Albert is a cheery, kind-hearted man.
	Yes, he's very popular with the people.
%0%a001240
	We don't have Stolos' staff any more.
%0%a001240
	But I'm sure we'll still be able to rescue Mum and Grandma if we put our minds to it!
%0%a001250
	We're eight years old already, Dad. That means we can do lots of things to help you.
%0%a001240
	Sancho's pretty strong, you know.
%0%a001240
	He does get out of breath quite quickly
	nowadays, though.
%0%a001250
	We travelled all over with Sancho, and he taught us all sorts of things.
%0%a001250
	We were with him that time we found Stolos'
	staff too.
Tuppence
	Sancho's quite a hero here in Gotha, you know.
	A loyal royal servant!
Tuppence
	The previous king placed great trust in him, apparently. I hope I have a reputation like that one day too.
%0%a001250
	If there's no castle up in the sky any more, does
	that mean it fell down? What if it broke into lots of little pieces?
Sancho
	Sí. One Zenithian señorita, eshe came here to the castle when eshe was lost. Thees ees why señor Pankraz ordered the researches to be done.
Sancho
	You know, thees Zenithian señorita, eshe estay here een Gotha because eshe no know how to go home. Ees, ees eso esad...
%0%a001240
	I can never get that soldier to play with me. He always just stands there on guard, and he won't stop concentrating even for a second.
%0%a001240
	I'm not supposed to come up here because
	it's dangerous.
%0%a001240
	But you're with me today, so no one can tell me off.
%0%a001250
	I used to like sneaking up here to look at the view.
%0%a001250
	I'd stand here and wonder where in the world you and Mum might be.
Tuppence
	I adore this kingdom, you know. I'd do absolutely anything to defend it if I had to.
%0%a001240
	I had a go at climbing the castle walls a while back to see how high I could get.
%0%a001240
	But, just as I cleared the second floor, I was spotted and told to get down.
%0%a001250
	I like being indoors too, but I really love
	being outside.
%0%a001250
	It's such good fun hearing all the little birds chatter away to each other.
Sancho
	I remember the time señor Pankraz, he leave thees castle to go and look for señora Mada.
Sancho
	And now ees, ees my friend's turn...
	Thees ees fate, sí? And ees my fate to
	go weeth you.
Tuppence
	It used to be my duty to patrol the castle grounds. Before I was assigned to travel with you, that is.
Tuppence
	I must admit that I am rather nervous. I do hope that I'll be of some use to you.
%0%a001240
	Um, you don't have all that much money, right, Dad? So don't worry about buying anything for me,
	will you?
%0%a001250
	The kingdom's money comes from the kingdom's people and it has to be used for them, apparently.
%0%a001250
	If we ever wanted anything for ourselves, we always had to save up and buy it with our own money.
%0%a001240
	Brilliant! It'll be fun travelling around together
	again, Dad.
%0%a001250
	Yay! Thanks, Dad. I won't let you down.
Sancho
	Gracias, friend. Ees eso good to be travelling together again. Olé! Let's go!
Tuppence
	It's an honour to be summoned, Your Majesty.
	I'll endeavour not to be a burden to you.
%0%a001240
	Sancho says he's really strong when it comes to drinking. Does that man's head hurt because he's
	too weak?
Tuppence
	Honestly! Does the man have no shame, admitting to such a thing in the presence of His Majesty!?
%0%a001250
	If that's what happens, then there's no way I'm ever going to drink, even when I'm all grown up.
%0%a001240
	Chancellor Jeeves was a bad man, wasn't he?
	...No way! He was killed!? That's a bit unlucky.
%0%a001250
	I thought this was Uncle Bertie's room from ages ago.
Tuppence
	It's been as peaceful as can be here at the castle ever since that debacle with the Chancellor.
%0%a001240
	I didn't used to hang out much here, but %a001250 would come and play here quite often.
%0%a001250
	I often used to get Cousin Gertie to tell me what it was like before she became a princess. We had lots of fun chatting!
Tuppence
	Princess Gertrude is actually not far from being my ideal woman. What man wouldn't find such a candid, lively beast attractive?
Sancho
	The truth ees, señorita Gertrude, eshe makes eso much trouble for señor Albert.
Sancho
	Ees good for heem eef we finish our quest esoon. Then he can have the siesta, sí?
%0%a001240
	If there are so few people left, do you think it's okay for us to just leave the castle?
%0%a001240
	I suppose we can't worry about that. It's more important that we go after the baddies and sort them out first.
Sancho
	Esome people, they just go missing. Others,
	they leave because they eso worried
	about everytheeng.
Sancho
	Now Gotha has once again eets king, maybe the good times, they estart again.
%0%a001240
	There was a gemstone in the village you used to live in? I want to go and find it!
%0%a001250
	I wonder if we'd find this famous craftsman if we went to Whealbrook. Maybe he's already moved
	on somewhere else.
%0%a001240
	It'd be nice to bring the old man home to his son one day, wouldn't it?
%0%a001250
	It's nice that he knows his dad's alive now. I can understand what a big relief that must be.
%0%a001240
	You must be desperate to find your mum, just like I'm desperate to find mine.
%0%a001250
	Grandma was good at making friends with monsters, right, Dad? Just like you are.
%0%a001250
	I really want to meet her.
Sancho
	Ees a fine idea, friend! Please, you do thees for your Uncle Sancho, sí?
%0%a001240
	That woman usually lives up in the sky, doesn't she? She's really pretty.
%0%a001250
	We used to visit that lady every once in a while,
	but she'd never talk to us.
%0%a001250
	I'm really happy that she will now.
Tuppence
	I had no idea that there was a Zenithian living in the castle until you brought me here, Your Majesty.
Tuppence
	I should imagine most other folk don't realise, either. A beautiful woman like that would be surrounded by admirers if they did!
Sancho
	The first time %a001240, he took the Zenithian Sword, I, I was eso moved!
Sancho
	As esoon as he can walk, %a001240 ees holding thees esword, and waving eet around.
Sancho
	Now I know. Thees ees why the esword, eet came to be een my hands.
%0%a001240
	%0%a001250's really friendly with animals and monsters, you know.
%0%a001240
	So are you, right, Dad? It's nice that you've got that in common.
Sancho
	Eh, friend! Are you ready to leave yet?
	You no forget the medicinal herbs and the chimaera wings, no?
Sancho
	You know, ees always a good idea to check your baggages one more time before you go.
Tuppence
	When you're striving towards a goal, it's always good to think about what you might want to do
	once you've achieved it, right?
Tuppence
	My first task when the world's peaceful again will be to find myself a beautiful bride.
Tuppence
	Hang on a minute! Why bother waiting? I could hunt her out during my world-saving travels and kill two birds with one stone!
%0%a001240
	Uncle Bertie got everyone together for
	your sake, Dad.
%0%a001250
	I really love Monty the monster monitor. Any friend of monsters is a friend of mine.
%0%a001240
	There aren't any other children of our age here, so we don't really have any friends.
%0%a001240
	It's lucky that %a001250 and I are twins and have each other.
%0%a001250
	Everyone here in the castle is really kind.
	And yet...I still always felt a bit lonely.
Tuppence
	I do love Gotha, but I've always found the place has a rather lonely feel to it. It needs more young women and children.
Tuppence
	Maybe I'll have to take matters into my own
	hands and bring back a lovely bride to have
	lots of children with!
Sancho
	Thees castle, eet ees the playground for %a001240 and %a001250 esince they are the leettle bebés.
Sancho
	And eef thees terrible theeng no happen
	to señora Mada, maybe you would have the
	childhood like thees too, friend.
%0%a001240
	You were born in this castle like I was, right, Dad? So we're the same!
%0%a001250
	We're not supposed to talk to the soldiers too much because it disturbs them from their work.
Tuppence
	I can't help feeling some of my fellow soldiers glaring at me somewhat. They must be jealous that I get to travel with His Majesty.
%0%a001240
	That dog really loves %a001250. He wags his tail much more when he sees her than when he sees me.
%0%a001240
	%0%a001250 reckons she can understand what animals are saying, you know.
%0%a001250
	I love animals! All animals!
Tuppence
	That dog's been around ever since I was a young boy. He must be a fair old age by now.
%0%a001240
	Um, Dad... Was it lonely being on your own as a statue for all those years?
%0%a001240
	I'm the big brother, so I was okay, but %a001250 seemed really sad and upset about it all.
Sancho
	Ees really eight years? Esometimes eet feels long, and esometimes eet feels eshort.
Sancho
	When I theenk what happened to señor Pankraz...
	And how, how hard eet ees for you, friend...
	I, I... (sob)
%0%a001250
	We found out you and Mum had been turned to stone when a little bird told us on our travels.
%0%a001250
	Then we went looking for Stolos' staff, and then finally we found you.
%0%a001250
	I don't remember what Mum looks like, either.
%0%a001250
	But I can remember her feeling all warm and
	smelling nice.
Tuppence
	I can only vaguely remember how she looked, but I do know Queen %a001230 was a real beauty.
Tuppence
	I do envy you, Your Majesty. I hope I manage to find myself such a stunning wife one of these days.
Sancho
	Thees Tuppence, he no eseem like a bad señor, no?
	Why don't you ask heem to accompany you?
%0%a001240
	Tuppence is one of the guards who's always patrolling the castle. I remember his name because
	it sounds a bit funny!
%0%a001240
	I quite like Tuppence. We should take him along with us again!
Sancho
	You see, friend. You are loved by everyone.
	Thees señor, he knows how great you are.
Sancho
	You eshould ask heem to accompany you again, no?
Sancho
	I ask myself, ⓗWhy you no esee thees chess no more, Sancho?ⓘ, and now I know. Ees because señor Tuppence, he has eet all the time.
Sancho
	And ees true. Sí, sí. I remember the look een the men's eyes when they play thees chess.
	Esometheeng was no right.
%0%a001250
	I find that chess set a bit scary for some reason. You won't leave me alone with it, will you, Dad?
%0%a001240
	I didn't wet the bed today, Dad! Ahem!
%0%a001250
	You sleep all nice and quietly, Dad. %0%a001240 moves about all the time and makes a terrible noise.
Tuppence
	It's quite amusing staying in one's own home under these circumstances.
%0%a001240
	We never really stayed here very much.
	We should say yes next time.
%0%a001250
	You seem a bit tired, Dad. Are you alright?
	You must rest every now and then, you know.
Tuppence
	If you don't mind the place being rather cramped and shabby, then please do avail yourself of it whenever you wish.
Tuppence
	It's the given duty of a soldier to protect the people of his land.
Tuppence
	And it's the given duty of a man to protect his family. Isn't that right, Your Majesty?
%0%a001240
	Tuppence is right. I wouldn't have expected him to come out with something so deep, though.
%0%a001250
	That nun used to be our teacher.
%0%a001240
	%0%a001250's really clever. She can do all the three Rs.
%0%a001240
	I'm... Well, I'm not quite so clever. But I do try hard!
Sancho
	The Goddess, eshe always watches over Gotha.
	When you are no here, friend, the monsters, eso many times they come flying to the castle...
Sancho
	But when they come, the Sword of Zenithia, eet makes the bright light and drives them away.
Sancho
	Now I remember thees, eet was very estrange.
	Maybe ees the work of the Goddess.
%0%a001240
	Has that old man been old even since you were little?
%0%a001240
	Wow! Then he must be ancient!
Tuppence
	Oh dear! I do hope he lives to see the day when things are peaceful again.
Sancho
	For your Uncle Sancho, I hope to esee the day when you and your family, they are all happily together again.
Sancho
	For thees we must work, friend!
Sancho
	Sí. I believe thees too.
	Señora Mada and señora %a001230, they are both of them alive.
%0%a001240
	Well, we know that much! We're hardly just going to leave Mum and Grandma to die, right!?
%0%a001240
	We used to stay here every now and then. It's more fun than sleeping at the castle.
%0%a001250
	Sancho always used to make us a delicious paella whenever we came to stay here.
%0%a001250
	But if I ever woke up at night, I'd catch him looking really miserable, so it was a bit worrying sometimes.
Sancho
	Eef you would like to be esafe eenside the castle, you must keep watching outside.
Sancho
	Señor Albert, he ask me to estay eenside, but ees my duty to be on guard here.
%0%a001240
	Do you think it's okay for guards to be asleep?
Tuppence
	I should imagine that he's no longer on duty for
	the day.
Tuppence
	But he's probably sleeping out here instead of his quarters so that he can be quick to notice if there's trouble afoot.
Sancho
	Ees no eso many people here een Gotha these days.
	The guards, they are working too hard.
Sancho
	Maybe the guards, they are working too much, no? They no have the time for enough siesta.
%0%a001250
	That soldier's really sleepy, but he's still working hard to guard the people of Gotha. What a good man!
Tuppence
	It may be arduous for me sometimes during our travels together, but it's hard work for the soldiers left behind at the castle too.
Tuppence
	I must try my absolute hardest to do my bit!
%0%a001240
	I'm really sleepy, Dad.
%0%a001250
	I don't care where we stay, Dad. Just as long as
	I can get some sleep soon.
Tuppence
	Do make yourself at home if you wish, Your Majesty.
%0%a001250
	That dog says I look a lot like Grandma Mada.
%0%a001250
	Do you think he's been living here in the castle long enough to know?
%0%a001240
	Looks like everyone's asleep. We'd better keep quiet. We wouldn't want to wake people up.
Tuppence
	Aah! The end of another good day's work!
%0%a001250
	The castle's a bit scary of a night. People say it was night-time when Mum was kidnapped.
%0%a001250
	That old man always seems to be asleep, even during the day.
%0%a001250
	When we've finished travelling and
	everywhere's peaceful again, it'd be
	nice to take him out somewhere.
%0%a001240
	It was a bit tricky finding Stolos' staff, but we all pulled together and got it in the end.
%0%a001240
	It's a good job you have clever kids like us, eh, Dad? Ha ha ha!
Sancho
	You know, %a001240 and %a001250, they work very hard for their papá.
Sancho
	Ees notheeng makes you more proud than having the wonderful children, sí?
%0%a001240
	That man used to be rubbish at singing, but then he practised and got a lot better. Anything's possible!
Tuppence
	My home's not too far away from here, so that man's songs were like lullabies to me in my younger years.
Tuppence
	I sometimes heard him cry out in his sleep too,
	mind you!
%0%a001240
	Don't worry, I won't fall asleep before I get to bed.
%0%a001240
	I was thinking we could have a bath first, anyway.
	(yawn)
Sancho
	Eh, friend. You come weeth me to Patty's pub?
	We dreenk and have esome laughs, eh?
Sancho
	Eh! No, no!
	Thees we do after we esave señora %a001230 and señora Mada.
Tuppence
	Patty the party planner is a provocative peach. It gives me palpitations just looking at her.
%0%a001250
	I'm friends with him, but his best human friend is Grandma Mada.
Sancho
	Sí. Ees late. Everyone ees esleeping now. Maybe ees time for us to esleep esoon too, no?
Tuppence
	There's no one about now. I could probably get away with a little sit on the royal throne...
Tuppence
	Er! Um! Nothing! I was just mumbling.
%0%a001240
	I'm pretty tired now. My feet are killing me.
%0%a001250
	A bath? I'm old enough to have a bath on my own now. It's embarrassing if anyone comes in with me!
%0%a001240
	Loads of people seem to talk in their sleep.
	I wonder what kinds of things I say.
%0%a001250
	No one seems to know where the Dragon God's gone. The monsters and the animals don't know, either.
%0%a001240
	Sancho always nagged us to clean our teeth
	before bed.
%0%a001240
	He said you used to do it every night without being asked. Is that true, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Hm? What is it...Dad? Zzzz...
Sancho
	Friend! You no forget now! You clean your teeth and do a wee-wee before you go to bed, okay?
Sancho
	You have the children now.
	They must learn from their papá.
%0%a001240
	That woman looked after us lots.
%0%a001250
	She took care of us like we were her own children, but it wasn't quite the same.
%0%a001250
	Even if we were bad, she never scolded us.
	I bet our real mum would've done.
Tuppence
	Fancy being able to sleep with His Majesty in the royal quarters! Ah, life's good!
%0%a001240
	It'd be cool if we could all sleep here together!
	Oh, but there's only one bed...
%0%a001250
	We heard lots of stories here in this house.
	Stories from Sancho's past.
%0%a001250
	I think we probably know everything there is to know about Grandpa Pankraz!
Sancho
	After I left Gotha weeth señor Pankraz, every day I make the dinner.
Sancho
	Ees no easy to look after the young friend when you no used to eet, but when I look back now, ees, ees eso happy times... (sob)
%0%a001250
	Sancho calls out in his sleep sometimes. He always sounds really upset.
%0%a001250
	I really like staying here, but I've seen him call out like that loads of times and it's not very nice.
%0%a001240
	Is Grandpa Pankraz really dead? Can't he come back to life somehow? Poor Sancho seems so sad.
%0%a001240
	Are we leaving Sancho behind? I'd rather he came along with us.
%0%a001250
	It's a bit lonely without Sancho...
%0%a001250
	Oh, but that doesn't mean I'm not happy to have you around, Dad. Sorry!
Tuppence
	Sancho must be getting on a bit, mustn't he?
	He's still very full of beans, though.
Sancho
	You know, your father, he never let you out of hees esight.
Sancho
	Maybe you eshould take %a001240 weeth you, no?
%0%a001250
	We have to take %a001240 with us, Dad!
	He's the hero, right!?
Tuppence
	It feels rather incongruous for me to be joining you when %a001240 is being left behind.
%0%a001240
	How come you want me but you don't want %a001250, Dad? It'd be much more fun if we all went off together.
Sancho
	I understand how you feel. You worry about her. But ees eso lonely for her eef you leave
	her behind.
Sancho
	You no reconsider, friend?
	As a favour for your Uncle Sancho?
Tuppence
	%0%a001250 seems rather disappointed...
