Bianca
	It's a bit on the small side, but it
	looks a lot like a castle to me.
Bianca
	Hey! Am I seein' things or is that a slime over there?
Nera
	A tiny little castle tucked away
	on a southern island...
Nera
	Do you see that slime over there?
	Whatever is it doing?
Bianca
	You can't knock him for bein' ambitious, but can slimes even make themselves bigger through trainin'?
Nera
	How funny to see a slime in training! But if it wants to be like the one on the roof, I'd say eating a lot would be the answer.
Bianca
	En't powjamas supposed to be some kind of warrior pyjamas? They dun't sound like they can be all that strong to me, mind.
Bianca
	Those chocolate medalliyums sound nice.
	I quite fancy givin' them a go.
Nera
	I think you'd need to be quite brave to wander about in your pyjamas all the time.
Nera
	Papa absolutely adores chocolate medalliyums.
	I'm fairly sure he bought them at the inn here.
Bianca
	Um, d'you reckon the bank here's above board, %a000090? It smells a bit fishy to me.
Nera
	He seems like a trustworthy fellow. It's nice to know he takes such good care of his customers' money.
Bianca
	Blimey! What a delicious-smellin' chocolate! That smell alone is enough to send you wobbly!
Nera
	Seeing this chocolate medalliyum reminds me of Papa.
Nera
	He used to be really skinny when he was younger, apparently. But then he developed a taste for these and there was no looking back.
Bianca
	I could eat these chocolate medalliyums until the cows come home, but I suppose we shouldn't be too frivolous, eh?
Nera
	We mustn't overindulge in these chocolate medalliyums, otherwise we'll get fat. Let's not buy too many.
Bianca
	Uh-oh. Looks like we en't bin managin' our finances all that well if we can't even afford to buy chocolate.
Nera
	We can buy some chocolate the next time we're here.
Bianca
	The lanterns look so pretty, dun't you think?
	All elegant, like.
Nera
	Those lanterns were probably made to commemorate departed slimes, don't you think?
Bianca
	It dun't look like hard work to me.
Nera
	That poor old man, having to come out
	at this time of night to do that.
Bianca
	D'you reckon there really is some
	great treasure hidden here?
Bianca
	We could try askin' around and
	seein' if we get any clues.
Nera
	I don't imagine we'll be able to acquire this
	ⓗgreat treasureⓘ all that easily.
Nera
	It would be a lovely thing to add to the museum's collection. Let's see if we can find it.
Bianca
	It's almost like that bloke's not from 'round here.
	I s'pose it's fair enough that he dun't know, though.
Nera
	It looks like this treasure we're looking for isn't something that everyone knows about.
Bianca
	Puzzling little thing? I wonder what it is!
Nera
	He gave it to the woman at the inn? It can't be that great a treasure if he just gave it away!
Bianca
	She must be talkin' about the treasure we heard about, eh, %a000090?
Bianca
	We should try and find the thing now we've trailed after it this far!
Nera
	It sounds like this treasure is really doing the rounds. I'm so curious about what it is!
Bianca
	He dumped it!? D'you think it's really that worthless?
Nera
	Hm. I'm not sure about going after something that's been thrown out, but I suppose we should go and find it after all this.
Bianca
	Crikey! Is it me or is that medal talkin'!?
Nera
	It sounds like someone's squashed underneath.
	We must help them!
Bianca
	Fancy that poor slime bein' squashed like that!
Bianca
	This must be this so-called ⓗgreat treasureⓘ we've bin hearin' so much about.
Bianca
	I've gotta say, it's a bit of a let-down.
Nera
	Well. I, er, suppose we've found the
	ⓗgreat treasureⓘ then.
Nera
	That old man will probably be pleased with it,
	at any rate. We should hurry up and take it to him.
Bianca
	It is pretty solid, I suppose. Maybe it could be used as a shield, after all! I wonder...!
Nera
	I think maxi medals are quite pretty too, personally. Papa would love to see it.
Bianca
	So it was in the fountain. No wonder
	Old Man Nick Knack couldn't find it.
Nera
	Ah, that must be why it has that funny smell to it, because of being in the water all that time.
Bianca
	Blimey! I hope no one was too badly hurt. So much for treasure bein' good!
Nera
	Goodness! What a huge-scale treasure hunt that would have been. Papa would've loved it.
Debora
	That castle is quite sweet-looking.
	I can think of worse places to live.
Debora
	There's a little thing bouncing about over there. Is it a slime?
Debora
	Looks like there are hard-working sorts even in the monster world.
Debora
	I've been basically perfect since the day I was born, though, so there's no need for me to make an effort.
Debora
	Powjamas? Yuck!
	I bet they smell of sweat.
Debora
	So they sell chocolate medalliyums here. I love them! You'd better buy me some.
Debora
	Ah yes, the chocolate medalliyum.
	Papa's always loved these.
Debora
	He's just like chocolate himself. If I turn on the charm, I can make him melt and do whatever I want!
Debora
	What? You're not buying any chocolate medalliyums? You've got some nerve, disobeying a direct order!
Debora
	You can't afford one measly chocolate medalliyum? Then you'd better sell something and get some cash. Something of yours, naturally.
Debora
	Oh! Those lanterns must be for slimes who've passed away. What a lovely sight!
Debora
	...Can't you take a hint, %a000090? This is where you're supposed to say that I'm far lovelier.
Debora
	I know you're interested in what people are up to, but you'll be an old man yourself if you stand here much longer.
Debora
	A great treasure... Hmm. As long as it's not just his imagination that's great.
Debora
	You're going to have to find it, %a000090. I'm not very good when it comes to looking for things.
Debora
	What are you waiting for? You should go and speak to the King. He's bound to know something.
Debora
	Puzzling little thing?
	What's that all about, I wonder.
Debora
	But what is it!? Hmph. My curiosity has the better of me now. You're going to have to find it.
Debora
	One man's rubbish is another man's treasure.
	Just like there are bound to be women out there who'll take on the men whose hearts I've broken.
Debora
	You're not just going to turn a blind eye are you, %a000090? Have some compassion!
Debora
	Do you think this is it? The elusive ⓗgreat treasureⓘ? You can see how it might be hard to keep tabs on. Unlike you.
Debora
	We'd better get back to the old man and give him what he's been waiting for then, %a000090.
Debora
	I suppose it could come in handy as a shield if you were desperate. But I have you if needs be, so I'm fine.
Debora
	It does smell a bit nasty. But I suppose we should just be grateful it's not still lying at the bottom of the fountain.
Debora
	Flying maxi medals?
	That sounds a bit lethal!
Debora
	I'm sure Nera would deposit her money here without a second thought. How about you?
Debora
	Ha ha! You don't mind taking the odd risk every now and then, do you?
Debora
	Hmph. I didn't expect you to be so cautious.
	How dull.
