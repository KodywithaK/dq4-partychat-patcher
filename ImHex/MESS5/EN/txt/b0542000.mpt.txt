Bianca
	I'm as out of place at an abbey as a slime would be in a quarry.
Bianca
	Have you got a bit of a thing for the graceful sorts that hang about these kind of places, though, %a000090?
Nera
	I spent quite a long period living here at the abbey.
	I think of it as my second home.
%0%a001240
	Are there only women living in this place?
	That's weird!
%0%a001240
	(yawn)
	Being here makes me feel all sleepy for some reason.
%0%a001250
	Look at all those flowers! The sky and the sea are really pretty here too.
%0%a001250
	This place is an abbey, isn't it?
	I know these things!
%0%a001250
	Really? Mum did domestic goddess training here? Then I'm going to do it too when I grow up!
Sancho
	Ees thees the abbey where you arrived and the esisters, they look after you eso well, friend?
Sancho
	Uf! Your Uncle Sancho, he ees no prepared for thees. I no breeng a present for them.
Tuppence
	It's not safe for all these young women to be living out here on their own, you know. Some of them are younger than others, mind you.
%0%a001250
	What a cute cat! Can I stroke it?
%0%a001240
	Do you think Mum would come home if we said a prayer for her?
%0%a001240
	I hate praying, but I'd give it a go if it would bring her back.
%0%a001250
	I hope I get to see Mum soon.
Sancho
	I eso esorry, friend. Ever esince you were born, you have eso much esuffering.
Nera
	Goodness! I can't believe how much that woman's changed. Maybe you age faster if you have to endure suffering.
Bianca
	Oh yeah. The folk here at the abbey helped you out that time, eh?
%0%a001240
	I'm going to try really hard to help you find your mum too, Dad!
%0%a001250
	As soon as I've found Mum, I want to find Grandma. Does that make me selfish?
Bianca
	Girls are always dreamin' about a handsome
	prince comin' and sweepin' them off their feet, eh?
	Me included.
Bianca
	I was pretty surprised when I found out after all them years that you were one!
Nera
	It sounds like her mother's worried about her. She probably just doesn't want her to end up as she has.
%0%a001240
	I prefer black horses myself. I like Dusty, though, obviously. She's been a big help.
%0%a001250
	Why will her mum get angry? Do you think my mum will get angry with me?
Tuppence
	Er... H-How about my good self? Would I suffice?
Tuppence
	I say! Can you hear me over there?
%0%a001240
	The Realm of the Faeries? That sounds much more interesting than this place.
Bianca
	Mostroferrato... It feels like a long while now since our weddin' day, eh?
Nera
	I'm surprised to hear talk of Mostroferrato out here. Now I feel like I want to drop in there and see how everyone is.
%0%a001240
	I'd be a bit nervous staying the night here among all these women. What if I wet the bed?
Tuppence
	Nuns are such splendid creatures.
	So pure, so gentle.
%0%a001240
	Morning, Dad! Another day, another step closer
	to our goal!
%0%a001250
	The bed here was really comfortable.
	Can we stay here again?
Sancho
	These esisters, they are eso kind. They allow even travellers like us to estay here weeth them.
Tuppence
	I'll never forget this: the night I spent in the same bed as His Majesty himself!
Bianca
	The sound of the waves here is really relaxin'.
	I slept better than I have in ages.
Nera
	This place is as relaxing as ever.
	I had a wonderful sleep.
%0%a001240
	What a pretty image of the Goddess.
	It looks just like Mum.
Sancho
	The esisters, they are fine artisans too, no?
	Ees eso well-made.
%0%a001240
	I can cook! Well, I can boil an egg, anyway.
Tuppence
	So all those habits were made by the nuns themselves? Well, there's a surprise.
Bianca
	Didn't Nera spend a bit of time here once?
	I wonder what kind of things she studied.
Nera
	Ah, this really takes me back. It feels like only yesterday that I was waking up every morning
	here in this room.
%0%a001240
	You won't make %a001250 come and stay here, will you, Dad? It'd be lonely if she went away.
Bianca
	It's quiet as the grave here of a night. It's almost like there's no one here at all.
Nera
	I really treasure the time I spent here.
Nera
	When I left for home, I never imagined I'd have the chance to visit the place again.
%0%a001240
	I'm not sleepy yet, don't worry.
	I could stay up all night if I had to!
%0%a001250
	Zzzz... Er, yep! I'm awake.
	Honest...
Sancho
	Ees completely dark now.
	Ees time for bed, no?
	We can continue our journey tomorrow.
Tuppence
	Wait a moment. I'd like to savour the air of the abbey for just a few minutes more.
%0%a001240
	Oh. Can't you get in here at night?
	Huh! How annoying!
Sancho
	Ees too late for visiting now, you know.
	We come back tomorrow.
Tuppence
	I suppose they have to be cautious, given that they're all women living out here alone. Pity, though.
Bianca
	There didn't used to be a bridge in the past, so you couldn't get here from Roundbeck and Whealbrook.
Nera
	I came here lots of times for shopping in the past. When I was staying at the abbey, I mean.
Nera
	Naturally, I didn't go to the casino during my
	days at the abbey. But Papa took me there lots
	of times before.
%0%a001240
	This place is pretty lively! I'm feeling all impatient now. I just want to explore and have fun!
%0%a001240
	When we came here before with Sancho, I watched a race at the slurpodrome.
%0%a001240
	Have you ever seen one, Dad?
	They're really good fun!
%0%a001250
	This town is so big, I'm sure I'd get lost in it in an instant. Don't let go of my hand, will you, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I can smell drink in the air, and it's still only daytime!
Sancho
	Uf... Ees eso many walls een thees town.
	You no feel trapped? I, I can no breathe
	eso well...
Sancho
	Even eenside Gotha Castle eet feels more open than thees. You no theenk eso, friend?
Sancho
	Ees alive een the day, but een the night, ees even more alive!
Tuppence
	So this is the famous Fortuna!
Tuppence
	I know, %a000090! Why don't we all split up for a while and have a bit of fun? ...No? Oh, what a shame!
Tuppence
	I'm afraid I'm not very proficient when it comes
	to the casino. I do enjoy a visit every once in a
	while, though.
Tuppence
	I tend to lose, so it's especially exciting for me when I do manage a win.
Bianca
	How the other half live, eh? Here we are, strugglin' away with our quest, and yet some folk are playin' away at the casino all day long!
Nera
	The casino's just a place to have fun. They make sure you don't get too carried away by stopping you from changing tokens back into gold coins.
Tuppence
	It's quite odd, really, but hearing other people talk about their wins makes me think I might be in with a chance myself.
Bianca
	If Coburg is a wonderful place now, it can only be thanks to Harry, eh?
%0%a001250
	What's wrong, Dad? Has that made you want to
	visit Coburg?
Sancho
	Ees easy to esay eet was plagued weeth the problems, but thees woman, eshe no knows
	how many people, they lost their lives.
Sancho
	But, no... Ees no good to leeve een the past like thees.
Bianca
	That soldier's wife must really love him to worry about him like that. Lucky thing!
Nera
	If I had to wait at home anxiously for you to come back safely, I'd probably be just the same as she is.
%0%a001240
	Hah! It's really cool that you've got so many unusual things in your collection, Dad.
Tuppence
	Pah! We don't need to hear about his love troubles!
Bianca
	So the Zenithian stuff en't the strongest there is, then, eh? That's a bit of a disappointment.
Nera
	Maybe that kind of equipment would be a big help to %a001240.
%0%a001240
	If he's that determined to find these strong weapons and armour, it probably means he's not very confident in his own strength.
Sancho
	Maybe ees true. The equipment from Zenithia, ees no eso new now. Maybe the modern weapons and armour, they are estronger.
Tuppence
	I'm sure it's something really special, then. Something that only I can equip!
Bianca
	It's hard to tell whether the shopkeeper here is really enthusiastic or if he's just takin' the mickey.
%0%a001250
	That shopkeeper's a bit scary. He stares too much!
Sancho
	I no like thees eshop. You no have to buy anytheeng here, friend.
Bianca
	It's nice to see kids runnin' about havin' fun, eh?
%0%a001240
	I'm really good at playing tag! We should have a game one day, Dad!
Tuppence
	Playing tag, are they? I used to love that as a young boy.
Tuppence
	I remember running headlong into a statue in the church once and smashing it to smithereens.
	Aah, happy days!
Nera
	If only %a001240 could just spend each day playing like that.
%0%a001250
	I don't see what's so much fun about just running about like that. Boys are weird!
Sancho
	Ees no fair. %0%a001240, he ees just a boy like thees, but he has eso much to worry about.
Bianca
	But it's a good short cut! I reckon most folk'd still try goin' that way if they could get away with it, eh?
%0%a001240
	I'll bet lots of people cut through there, anyway.
Bianca
	A slime curio... Sounds pretty curious to me.
Nera
	Papa wanted one of those. But he left Fortuna before he could be considered a regular customer.
%0%a001240
	That slime curio sounds pretty interesting.
	I wouldn't mind having that.
Sancho
	Ees no easy to do the eshopping here, eh?
	How do you become a special customer?
Bianca
	If the local folk are callin' the place strange, then it must be pretty odd.
Nera
	I don't think the place is strange. I always thought the owner was rather sweet.
%0%a001250
	I know where he means. It's that little shop with the funny curtain hanging up.
Bianca
	Hmm. I'm not sure that displayin' that thing would be such a good idea.
%0%a001240
	It'd be a waste just to hang it up in a museum somewhere. I want to keep it with me all the time!
Bianca
	I wonder if you'd end up not bein' able to turn yourself back from a dragon, though.
	That's what'd worry me.
Nera
	You'd be so wild and magnificent as a dragon... Ah!
%0%a001240
	Imagine how cool it'd be to turn into a great
	big dragon!
Sancho
	What kind of dark magic must be eenside thees estaff? I no like to theenk about eet.
Bianca
	Fancy ditchin' your work just so you can go and doss about in the casino!
Nera
	Oh dear! Fancy leaving his shop like that.
	I hope there's nothing too valuable here.
%0%a001240
	Yikes! He just left! He must've really wanted to go and gamble, mustn't he?
%0%a001250
	Um... That means we can't do any shopping now.
Bianca
	Hmm. You have to be careful who you marry, eh? Marry in haste and repent at leisure, as they say.
Nera
	She should just tell him his behaviour's unacceptable. That's the only way to tackle a situation like that.
%0%a001240
	Do you think I'll end up like that one day? Uh-oh!
Tuppence
	Casinos are like special havens for some men.
	Women can't possibly understand it.
Bianca
	Yeah, he does look in a bit of a state, eh?
Nera
	It's not just his throat I'm worried about. He'll damage his whole body if he's not careful.
%0%a001240
	If his throat gets sore, then he won't be able to read poems or sing songs any more. Maybe he'll have to change jobs.
Sancho
	Anda! Thees señor, he ees dreenking from eso early een the day? Ees better you wait for the evening and the paella to wash eet down.
Nera
	Oh dear. The poor man. But I'm sure his
	beloved would be terribly upset to see him
	in this kind of state.
%0%a001250
	Don't cry, Mr Poet! Your dream lady will be worried about you if you do!
Tuppence
	What a calamity! I'd better hurry up and find my dream lady, then. It would be terribly inconvenient
	if she died before I found her.
Bianca
	Do you get it, %a000090? Somewhere you can call home dun't necessarily have to be a physical place.
Bianca
	...Or am I gettin' a bit too airy-fairy?
Nera
	Your home is right beside me. And mine is right beside you. Ah, it's so nice to be there for each other.
%0%a001240
	Dinner...? I'm starting to feel a bit peckish myself.
%0%a001250
	I'd make dinner and wait home for you if you went away, Dad. But I'm glad we're travelling about together at the moment.
Tuppence
	I'm suddenly reminded of Mother for some reason.
	I do hope the old stick's getting on alright.
Bianca
	If he's asleep durin' the day, that probably means he works of a night.
Nera
	We shouldn't disturb the man when his shop's closed. Come on, let's go.
%0%a001240
	Was that man saying all that in his sleep!?
%0%a001250
	What a funny way of snoring he had!
Bianca
	I wonder what kind of adventures that old man had. We should ask him if we ever get the chance.
Nera
	Papa used to be an adventurer when he was younger too. Not that you'd know it to look
	at him now.
%0%a001240
	A traveller. How exciting!
%0%a001240
	I suppose we're travellers too, aren't we?
	Ha ha!
%0%a001250
	That man was squinting just then. Do you think he was trying to look off into the distance?
%0%a001240
	Does that mean I'm not handsome? Huh!
%0%a001250
	Why don't we try again in the evening, Dad?
Sancho
	Esometimes the drowning man, he clutches at the
	straws. Maybe ees no esuch a bad idea to listen to
	the fortune-teller esometimes too.
%0%a001240
	Yikes! Her face goes all scary when she tells
	your fortune!
Tuppence
	Fortune-tellers always seem to beat about the bush so much. I must admit that I find it rather irritating.
Bianca
	All of the monsters back there in the cage seem to be pretty well-behaved, eh?
Nera
	The monsters here seem to behave just as the old man wants.
%0%a001240
	It looks like Monty the monster monitor has a place here too.
%0%a001250
	Ooh! Look at all the monsters in those cages! Do you think the old man keeps his monsters here too?
Tuppence
	You have to admire anyone brave enough to take on monsters like this. I wonder if he ever gets bitten.
Bianca
	She looks a bit out of place down here. Maybe the old man likes havin' her here to keep him lively.
Nera
	Having a bunny girl down here gives the place a nice, flamboyant air.
%0%a001240
	The assistant certainly has some good tips!
%0%a001250
	Now I really want to visit the Realm of the Faeries!
Sancho
	Weird monsters?
	You can't wait to go and esee, eh, friend?
	You are buzzing like a mosquito!
Bianca
	But you are totally awesome! I reckon you'll be able to get loads of monsters on board.
%0%a001250
	I want to make friends with lots and lots of monsters. You'll have to try really hard, Dad!
Sancho
	At the T 'n' T boards?
	How many tickets you would need for thees, eh?
Sancho
	But, sí! I forget!
	Now we have the free pass.
	Ees no problem!
Bianca
	So you're already the best there is, then. That sort of happened by accident, eh?
Nera
	Well, you have worked really hard for a long time now. It's only right that you receive some
	recognition for it.
%0%a001240
	Yeah, you even got Starkers and Rebjørn to join us. That's pretty awesome by anyone's standards!
%0%a001250
	I'm glad I was born your daughter, Dad.
Tuppence
	I suppose that makes me awesome by extension, then! ...Or is that not the general consensus?
Bianca
	Fancy havin' an underground jail in town! I s'pose there's bound to be crime when you collect so many folk together in one spot, though.
Nera
	Jails always seem to feel so cold.
%0%a001240
	This place is really creepy. I'd rather not come down here if we don't have to.
%0%a001250
	It's dark and cold and smelly down here.
	I don't like it!
Bianca
	Well, he might come a cropper at the hands of some monster before he gets where he's goin'. I'm sure the Goddess'll pass her judgement if need be.
Nera
	We won't actually be allowing the world to be swallowed up in a cloud of darkness... But it's good to give the man a chance to atone for his sins.
%0%a001240
	I wonder where he headed off to.
Sancho
	Even the criminals, they have a madre and a papá, sí? Maybe he can become a good señor een the end.
Tuppence
	After us the deluge, as they say.
	...Don't they?
Bianca
	Um... You sure we should've let him go, %a000090?
Nera
	Oh dear! He's gone!
%0%a001240
	He said something about the stool.
	I wonder what's there.
%0%a001250
	That man was really stinky.
Sancho
	Eesⓚⓛ
	Ees the thug who...
	When señor Harry, he was...!
Bianca
	That's worth knowin', eh?
	We should go and give it a whirl!
Bianca
	Er, I suppose we'd better watch that we dun't end up spendin' too much time gamblin', though.
Nera
	Well! He's certainly in the know.
%0%a001240
	Do you think that's true?
Sancho
	Ees only helpful eef they no have changed
	the places of the eslot machines. But ees
	probably okay.
Bianca
	Bein' in a casino is like bein' in another world. It helps you forget your troubles for a little while.
Nera
	Don't forget that a casino is just a place to let off a little steam. You mustn't get too carried away.
%0%a001240
	Dad! Dad! Let's go to the slurpodrome and watch a slime race! I reckon I can pick a winner!
%0%a001250
	Did you see that man before? He was crying.
	Don't you cry, will you, Dad?
Sancho
	Maybe we can ween esometheeng for our journey. Esometheeng which ees gonna muchos help us.
Sancho
	But you no gamble too much, okay, friend?
	The first rule of the casino ees to take eet eslow.
Tuppence
	Rrraargh! The gambler's blood in me is flowing fast and furious again for the first time in a long time!
Tuppence
	...Hm? You look surprised. Did you not know about my penchant for a flutter?
Bianca
	He's right, %a000090. We shouldn't get too carried away.
Nera
	Some people get hooked despite that. Imagine what it would be like if you could actually win money here!
Sancho
	Ees a good idea, no? Eef the casino, eet no return to the clientes their gold, they gonna make beeg money!
Sancho
	Maybe ees time for a casino een Gotha, no?
	But ees no good for the esafety. The crime, ees gonna increase too. Hmm...
Nera
	That man's eyes were all bloodshot and creepy.
%0%a001250
	He was a bit carried away for a grown-up.
Sancho
	You no talk too much, okay, friend?
	Eef you play here, you play.
	But eef you go, you must go quickly.
Tuppence
	How exciting! We'll have to see how this one
	works out.
Bianca
	Ha ha ha! I've had the same thought when I've bin playin' on the slots myself!
%0%a001240
	Imagine what it would be like to be cramped up
	inside there!
Tuppence
	If there is someone inside, I can't see them being of Sancho's stature!
Nera
	When your luck's in, your luck's in.
Tuppence
	When I hear people say things like that, I feel I must give it a try, otherwise I'll be missing out!
Bianca
	Yeah, it's not a bad show. I wouldn't mind wearin'
	a dress like that and tryin' my hand at a bit of the old theatricals.
Nera
	Yes, it really is a beautiful performance.
	I can't understand why there aren't more
	people in the audience.
%0%a001250
	Yes, I wish we had a bit longer to watch the show.
%0%a001240
	What a shame it didn't break by getting stuck spewing out tokens.
Bianca
	I guess you have to roll with it when your luck's good, eh?
Nera
	You have to be careful, though. If you get too carried away, you could easily fall on bad luck.
%0%a001240
	Hear that? He says we should go for it!
Tuppence
	Absolutely! We men have to see things through right to the bitter end!
Bianca
	When things en't goin' well for me, I tend to give up on them. Not just in the casino neither.
Nera
	I'm not sure that's a good idea. If you just keep on trying even when you're losing, you could end up in
	a very sorry state.
%0%a001250
	If we're not doing very well, can't we just leave?
	My ears are starting to hurt.
Sancho
	Esometimes you must just estop.
	Otherwise you gonna be a desperado,
	you know.
Bianca
	You never know when your time might be up, so I dun't want to leave anythin' in my life undone.
Nera
	Everyone seems to be talking about how the world's being overtaken with darkness of late. Maybe the time's finally upon us.
%0%a001240
	If I'm going to die, then I may as well get in whatever enjoyment I can now, right, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Are we all really going to die? You and Mum and me and all of us? I don't like it!
Sancho
	Ees no worrying for you? These bad gossips, we
	hear them everywhere.
Tuppence
	Don't you worry. I'm going to live my life to the full, in true Tuppence style!
Bianca
	Typical old bloke, eh? Thinks he knows all there is to know about life just because his has bin a long one!
Nera
	I suppose there are all sorts of ways to find entertainment in a casino.
%0%a001240
	How come he says you can see all walks of life here? I can't see anything special. I don't get it!
%0%a001250
	I don't really like casinos. They're so noisy.
Bianca
	I en't sure it's the kind of thing he should be bettin' on, but it looks like he's got a winner there, eh?
Sancho
	Ees like a game for thees señor, eh?
	Because he doesn't know anytheeng.
	Maybe he's lucky...
Bianca
	It really is a stunnin' dress. Looks like they spent a fair old bit on the costumes for this panto, eh?
Nera
	It's impossible to hear what's being said with all that noise going on.
%0%a001250
	What a pretty dress! I hope I get to wear a dress like that one day.
Sancho
	You know, when I theenk about eet now, ees no eso often that %a001250, eshe has a chance to wear a pretty dress, no?
Tuppence
	Good heavens! Did you see all the make-up on her? How's her natural beauty supposed to shine through with all that in the way?
Bianca
	D'you think you're s'posed to just get up on stage like that and start warblin' away?
Nera
	Ah, she's playing the role of the wicked stepmother.
%0%a001240
	Yikes! She's got a bit of a loud voice on her!
Tuppence
	I think it might be wise to watch this one from afar.
Bianca
	Looks like she's the heroine of the piece.
%0%a001240
	Is that girl being bullied? I know it's just a story, but I still feel sorry for her.
%0%a001250
	I know this story! Have you heard it before
	too, Dad?
Tuppence
	Hmm. It's rather tricky to tell if she's pretty or not with all that make-up in the way.
Bianca
	A palace ball! How nice! Come to think of it, we've
	got our own castle and yet we never put on a dance, eh?
Nera
	He he. We have ourselves a palace, but I don't see us organising a ball any time soon, do you?
%0%a001240
	Oh no! Do all princes have to go to balls?
	I hate dancing!
Bianca
	Bein' told not to open it makes you want to open it
	all the more, eh? We could try and have a peek while she en't lookin'...
Nera
	It's almost like she's saying that to try and get us to open it! Maybe it's some kind of trap.
Tuppence
	Hmm. The inside of a dancing girl's wardrobe could be quite a sight to behold.
Bianca
	I doubt they can do much travellin' with how things are at the moment. I s'pose that means they're probably stuck here a while.
Nera
	Yes, the play was different to last time.
	Still, I suppose that was a while ago now.
Tuppence
	I wonder who's in charge here.
Bianca
	Huh! It's not like she's still changing. She's only got her make-up left to do.
Bianca
	I reckon she's just tryin' to get rid of us. Well, you don't need to tell me twice. Let's get goin'.
Nera
	We should leave her in peace. We wouldn't want her to think we're peeping toms.
%0%a001250
	She told you off, Dad!
Tuppence
	But she's already dressed. Oh, to have a better sense of timing!
Bianca
	The slimes here are so colourful and cute!
Nera
	I wonder how those slimes managed to turn themselves into such funny colours!
%0%a001240
	Yay! It's a slurpodrome! I bet I can pick a winner. Now, let's see...
%0%a001250
	He he! Look at all those funny-coloured slimes!
Sancho
	The eslimes, they are eso cute, no? Ees because they have the healthy paunch, you know. I no theenk of them as monsters.
Tuppence
	Slime races just don't seem exciting enough.
	I can't quite get into the gambling frame of mind
	with them somehow.
Bianca
	Ha ha ha! Looks like the old bloke's havin' fun!
Nera
	He's looking at those slimes with so much
	affection. It's almost as if he thinks of them
	as his grandchildren!
%0%a001240
	It's funny when the slimes fall splat on their faces!
%0%a001250
	I can't figure it out either. These slimes are all quite unpredictable.
Bianca
	Slimes are so bouncy and cute-looking.
Bianca
	But when you touch them, they're so...slimy! Yuck!
Nera
	The slimes here have such bright, shining eyes.
%0%a001250
	That slime smells of strawberries!
Tuppence
	I say! These slimes are roaming free.
	Do you suppose that's safe?
Bianca
	Yeah, but still, you never can tell what'll happen at the slurpodrome.
%0%a001240
	That one certainly seems to look down its nose at
	the others, doesn't it? Assuming slimes have noses, that is.
%0%a001250
	That slime smells of fresh leaves.
Sancho
	You wanna bet on the green eslime, My Majesty? Hmm...
Bianca
	It'd be fun if we could get a talkin' slime in
	our party, eh? Unless they'd be too much of
	a chatterbox.
Nera
	Slimes are so childish and silly. Er... I mean childlike and innocent.
%0%a001250
	Urgh! That slime smells of curry!
Bianca
	We used to play T 'n' T together when we were kids. You always won, mind.
Nera
	I always marvel at who thought up the idea of such gigantic T 'n' T boards.
%0%a001240
	Yay! It's Treasures and Trapdoors!
%0%a001250
	I really like T 'n' T. I always manage to beat %a001240.
Sancho
	Hmm... Ees no eso beeg, thees board, eh?
Tuppence
	Ooh! If you're planning on a game of T 'n' T, you must let me do the honours! You won't be sorry, I promise.
Bianca
	If only you could always roll what you wanted, eh? I s'pose that'd get a bit borin', though.
Nera
	Oh dear. He's taking it all rather seriously.
	You men can be so funny at times.
%0%a001250
	I've already figured out the best way around. Pretty clever, don't you think, Dad?
Sancho
	Thees ees a good idea! First you look at
	the board from the floor, then you take the
	challenge, sí?
Tuppence
	A real man shouldn't dilly-dally! No, he should make up his mind and be done with it.
Bianca
	Huh! Let's give it another go, %a000090!
Nera
	I didn't expect anyone to be down there! I hope he couldn't see up my skirt...
%0%a001240
	Ha ha ha! It's quite fun falling off too!
Tuppence
	You don't think he's hanging around there just so he can laugh at people, do you?
Tuppence
	Honestly! Some people!
Bianca
	What a mean old man. We'll have to make sure we don't fall off the board if we decide to have a game.
Nera
	The poor man. It must be frustrating not to have ever succeeded.
Sancho
	Ees no eso fun to watch the others losing, you know. Ees a shame for thees señor.
Tuppence
	That does sound like it could be rather funny. If I had time to hang around, I wouldn't mind seeing someone fall.
Bianca
	This place is pretty lively of a night too, eh?
Bianca
	There didn't used to be a bridge in the past, so you couldn't get here from Roundbeck and Whealbrook.
Nera
	I never visited here at night during my time at the abbey. It's quite a revelation.
Nera
	Naturally, I didn't go to the casino during my
	days at the abbey. But Papa took me there lots
	of times before.
%0%a001240
	This place is pretty lively! I'm feeling all impatient now. I just want to explore and have fun!
%0%a001240
	When we came here before with Sancho, I watched a race at the slurpodrome.
%0%a001240
	Have you ever seen one, Dad?
	They're really good fun!
%0%a001250
	This town is so big, I'm sure I'd get lost in it in an instant. Don't let go of my hand, will you, Dad?
%0%a001250
	............Zzz.
%0%a001250
	......Hm? Did you say something?
	Yes, yes! I'm awake......
Sancho
	Uf... Ees eso many walls een thees town.
	You no feel trapped? I, I can no breathe
	eso well...
Sancho
	Even eenside Gotha Castle eet feels more open than thees. You no theenk eso, friend?
Sancho
	Ees the night, but ees eso bright, eet feels like the day!
Tuppence
	So this is the famous Fortuna!
Tuppence
	I know, %a000090! Why don't we all split up for a while and have a bit of fun? ...No? Oh, what a shame!
Tuppence
	I'm afraid I'm not very proficient when it comes
	to the casino. I do enjoy a visit every once in a
	while, though.
Tuppence
	I tend to lose, so it's especially exciting for me when I do manage a win.
Bianca
	This place never sleeps, eh?
Nera
	If only everyone here was having fun. I'm afraid they have their fair share of desolate souls here too, though.
%0%a001240
	We don't have much time to enjoy the place, though, do we?
Sancho
	Ees too much temptation here.
	You must no let yourself become weak.
	Ees time to estay een the inn for tonight.
Tuppence
	If only I could forget my duties for a while and really let my hair down...
Bianca
	Maybe we should have a bit of a flutter, eh?
Nera
	It's upsetting to see people down in the dumps like that. The point of a casino is to have fun, after all.
%0%a001240
	There's not much point in him telling us, is there? There's nothing we can do about it.
%0%a001250
	Urgh! That man smelt like he'd had a whole barrel of drink to himself!
Tuppence
	It's no use crying over spilt milk. The important thing in this game is knowing when to call it a day.
Bianca
	He seems really sad. I wonder what happened to him.
Nera
	It might be best if we gave him some space.
%0%a001240
	The lights here at night are really pretty.
%0%a001250
	I really like stars, so I suppose that must mean I like night-time. I always get really sleepy, though.
Sancho
	Sí, ees true. Ees especially true on the
	quiet nights. Then you theenk of eso
	many, many memories.
Tuppence
	I'm not overly fond of the night-time myself. There always tend to be more monsters out on the prowl.
%0%a001240
	Does that mean I'm not the man of her liking? Oh! ...Actually, I'm sort of relieved.
%0%a001250
	I don't particularly want to hear my
	fortune anyway.
Sancho
	Esometimes the drowning man, he clutches at the straws. Maybe ees no esuch a bad idea to listen to the fortune-teller esometimes too.
%0%a001240
	Yikes! Her face goes all scary when she tells
	your fortune!
%0%a001250
	Maybe I should become a fortune-teller when I
	grow up.
Tuppence
	It's rather fortunate that she'd give us a reading for free, isn't it, %a000090?
	...Ha ha! Fortunate! I'm an accidental comedian!
%0%a001240
	Don't you want her to tell our fortune?
	I was looking forward to that.
Tuppence
	Yes, fortune-telling can be a bit hit-and-miss. Maybe it's not worth paying any attention to it all.
Bianca
	I'm sure that won't stop you, eh? You just have to poke your nose in everywhere, dun't you?
Nera
	Well it's probably best not to go barging in there then, okay, %a000090?
%0%a001250
	I quite fancy having a bath now.
Tuppence
	How rude! As if I'd barge in on someone while they were busy!
Bianca
	What a cheek! How were we s'posed to know he was in 'ere?
Nera
	Well, that's not very nice. It's not our fault there's no door on the bathroom.
Sancho
	Thees señor, we should leave heem een peace, no? Sí, there ees notheeng to esee here. Ees time for us to leave.
Tuppence
	We'll have to time things more appropriately next time, %a000090.
Bianca
	We would've probably felt the same under normal circumstances, but it's a bit different when one of your kids is the legendary hero, eh?
Nera
	Everyone wants a world without horrible monsters, but it would be a shame if all the nice monsters had to disappear too.
%0%a001240
	I used to think I didn't get much chance to play, but it doesn't look like most other kids do either.
%0%a001250
	It's fun travelling about together, but I sometimes think how nice it would be if we could all just live normal, quiet lives at home.
Bianca
	I dun't much like hearin' other women chattin' you up. I s'pose that's a wife's prerogative, eh?
Nera
	It seems I'm not the only one who finds you so attractive, %a000090!
%0%a001250
	It's funny hearing her talk to you like that.
Tuppence
	Some people just have an eye for it, you see.
	I'm referring to my sex appeal, of course.
Bianca
	And yet he takes another sip, so it can't be all
	that bad!
%0%a001240
	Ooh! I wonder if the landlord watered them down!
Sancho
	The taste of the alcohol, eet depends on your own mood, you know.
Sancho
	When you are happy, eet tastes like the liquid paella. But when you are esad, ees, ees... (sniff)
Bianca
	Mum and Dad gave me a brilliant childhood.
	They always took good care of me.
Bianca
	With Mum gone, the family got a bit smaller for
	a while. But now you've joined, so we're back up
	to three.
Bianca
	And now we have %a001240 and %a001250. We've got so much to be thankful for, even though times are tough.
Nera
	We were separated for a long time, but I'm truly happy now that we've been reunited.
Nera
	It really is the best thing in the world to have
	a family.
%0%a001240
	There's lots of houses here in this town, isn't there? I'm bound to get lost.
%0%a001250
	I can do anything as long as you're all with me.
Sancho
	Your Uncle Sancho, he no have a family now.
	For me, señor Pankraz, he was my family.
	But now he ees no lon... No longer... (sob)
Tuppence
	I wonder how Mother is getting along.
Bianca
	He must be a feisty old man to spend every night down the pub like that.
Nera
	I hope that old fellow isn't drinking to excess with all those pub visits.
%0%a001240
	Why do grown-ups all spend so much time at the pub? I don't get it.
Sancho
	The alcohol, ees all poison, you know. When you are young, and when you are old. Ees no good to dreenk too much.
Bianca
	It's a pretty normal-lookin' place for a
	fortune-teller's house.
Nera
	I heard talk of the fortune-teller here when I was at the abbey. Apparently, her readings can be a bit hit and miss.
%0%a001250
	Do you think he's waiting up for her to come home? That's nice of him.
Bianca
	How many times do I have to tell you that you shouldn't go tryin' to start conversations with folk while they're sleepin'?
Nera
	You really shouldn't intrude on a woman while she's sleeping, %a000090.
%0%a001240
	What's going on with her ears!?
Tuppence
	Bunny girls are cute even when they're sleeping!
Bianca
	Fancy havin' an underground jail in town! I s'pose there's bound to be crime when you collect so many folk together in one spot, though.
Nera
	Jails always seem to feel so cold.
%0%a001240
	This place is really creepy. I'd rather not come down here if we don't have to.
%0%a001250
	It's dark and cold and smelly down here.
	I don't like it!
Tuppence
	I say! That soldier's asleep! Do you suppose we should wake him?
Bianca
	Um... You sure we should've let him go, %a000090?
Nera
	Oh dear! He's gone!
%0%a001240
	He said something about the stool.
	I wonder what's there.
%0%a001250
	That man was really stinky.
Sancho
	Eesⓚⓛ
	Ees the thug who...
	When señor Harry, he was...!
Bianca
	That's worth knowin', eh?
	We should go and give it a whirl!
Bianca
	Er, I suppose we'd better watch that we dun't end up spendin' too much time gamblin', though.
Nera
	Well! He's certainly in the know.
%0%a001240
	Do you think that's true?
Sancho
	Ees only helpful eef they no have changed
	the places of the eslot machines. But ees
	probably okay.
Bianca
	Eh? Dun't you want it? I was thinkin' it could come in really handy.
Nera
	ⓗThe Big Book of Beastsⓘ could be quite useful. If it's only a thousand gold coins, we could just take a chance and buy it...
%0%a001240
	Ooh! What's ⓗThe Big Book of Beastsⓘ?
%0%a001250
	ⓗThe Big Book of Beastsⓘ... That sounds pretty impressive. I want one!
Bianca
	Nice! Let's go and check it out.
Nera
	I wonder what this Big Book of Beasts is all about. How exciting!
%0%a001240
	Yay! We got it! We got it!
	Um... What is ⓗThe Big Book of Beastsⓘ, anyway?
%0%a001250
	Did you buy ⓗThe Big Book of Beastsⓘ?
	Is it all about monsters and things?
Bianca
	Hm, it's pretty tough havin' to buy stuff for all our gang, eh?
Nera
	Oh well. I suppose we'll just have to come back again when we've saved up.
%0%a001250
	Can't you afford it, Dad? You could always sell some of my clothes to get some more money.
Sancho
	I am esorry, friend. My pockets, they are empty.
	I can no geeve you notheeng.
Bianca
	He certainly stocks some pretty curious items,
	eh? Seems to be doin' a fairly decent business
	out of it, mind.
Nera
	I can't wait to see what the next weird and wonderful item he has in stock will be!
%0%a001240
	Let's come back here again, Dad!
Sancho
	Thees señor, he ees a good businessman, sí?
	He ees as esharp as a machete!
Bianca
	Yeah, five thousand gold coins seems like a bit of a fortune to spend on a funny old curtain.
Nera
	Oh! Aren't you going to buy it? But it's so sweet!
Nera
	Sorry. If you've made up your mind, then I won't try to change it.
%0%a001240
	Oh! Go on, Dad! Buy it, buy it, buy it!
%0%a001250
	If you don't want to buy it, then I won't try to change your mind.
Sancho
	I no eso esure how many times we gonna need thees slime curio when we are travelling...
Bianca
	Did you really want this funny old curtain, %a000090? It dun't much look like your kind
	of thing.
Nera
	Yippee! I'm so happy! This is just what I wanted!
	It's so pretty!
%0%a001240
	Yay! We got it! Thanks, Dad! I'm going to use it as a blanket when I go to bed tonight.
%0%a001250
	It doesn't look all that cute when you get up close.
Sancho
	Qué? Oh, you can wear thees curio.
	I wonder who ees gonna look the best een eet.
Bianca
	Hm, it's pretty tough havin' to buy stuff for all our gang, eh?
Nera
	Oh well. I suppose we'll just have to come back again when we've saved up.
%0%a001250
	Can't you afford it, Dad? You could always sell some of my clothes to get some more money.
Sancho
	I am esorry, friend. My pockets, they are empty.
	I can no geeve you notheeng.
Bianca
	Does that mean he's shuttin' up shop? I was lookin' forward to seein' what other weird and wonderful things he might have on sale.
Nera
	I hope he'll start selling his curiosities again once the world is in better shape.
%0%a001240
	Do you think he travels about on his own?
	That would be hard going.
Tuppence
	Yes, I don't think I'd be too keen on travelling about at the moment if I weren't with you, %a000090.
Bianca
	Bein' in a casino is like bein' in another world. It helps you forget your troubles for a little while.
Nera
	Don't forget that a casino is just a place to let off a little steam. You mustn't get too carried away.
%0%a001240
	Dad! Dad! Let's go to the slurpodrome and watch a slime race! I reckon I can pick a winner!
%0%a001250
	Did you see that man before? He was crying.
	Don't you cry, will you, Dad?
Sancho
	Maybe we can ween esometheeng for our journey. Esometheeng which ees gonna muchos help us.
Sancho
	But you no gamble too much, okay, friend?
	The first rule of the casino ees to take eet eslow.
Tuppence
	Rrraargh! The gambler's blood in me is flowing fast and furious again for the first time in a long time!
Tuppence
	...Hm? You look surprised. Did you not know about my penchant for a flutter?
Bianca
	He's right, %a000090. We shouldn't get too carried away.
Nera
	Some people get hooked despite that. Imagine what it would be like if you could actually win money here!
Sancho
	Ees a good idea, no? Eef the casino, eet no return to the clientes their gold, they gonna make beeg money!
Sancho
	Maybe ees time for a casino een Gotha, no?
	But ees no good for the esafety. The crime, ees gonna increase too. Hmm...
Bianca
	We probably act like that when we get caught up in gamblin'. How embarrassin'!
Nera
	He seems to be a bit over-excited. Maybe he's never had a win before.
%0%a001240
	Go on!
	That's the way!
%0%a001250
	He was a bit carried away for a grown-up.
Sancho
	You no talk too much, okay, friend?
	Eef you play here, you play.
	But eef you go, you must go quickly.
Bianca
	Hm, but you can lose a lot of money fast in
	the hundred-token slots, so you really have
	to go careful.
Nera
	Papa only ever played on the hundred-token slot machines. It seems rather frivolous when I think of it now.
%0%a001240
	Hundred-token slots...
	Maybe I'm not quite ready for them yet.
Tuppence
	The hundred-token slots? Dear me! I do love casinos, but I tend to be a bit too cautious to play with those kind of amounts.
Bianca
	Mum always said that every profession needs its underlings. Without them, the whole thing falls apart.
Nera
	I hope he has his dream come true some day.
%0%a001250
	Aaah. That man had such a nice voice.
	I hope I get to talk to him again...
Bianca
	Urgh! He spat on me!
Nera
	He should stop there and have a rest before he does himself a mischief.
%0%a001240
	Where's the stunning young beauty come to steal a prince's cart? What? She's behind me?
	Oh no she isn't!
%0%a001240
	What do you think?
	Did I get the words right?
Bianca
	Typical old bloke, eh? Thinks he knows all there is to know about life just because his has bin a long one!
Nera
	I suppose there are all sorts of ways to find entertainment in a casino.
%0%a001240
	How come he says you can see all walks of life here? I can't see anything special. I don't get it!
%0%a001250
	I don't really like casinos. They're so noisy.
Bianca
	I en't sure it's the kind of thing he should be bettin' on, but it looks like he's got a winner there, eh?
Sancho
	Ees like a game for thees señor, eh?
	Because he doesn't know anytheeng.
	Maybe he's lucky...
Bianca
	They all dance so well. It's quite a show!
Nera
	I'm surprised their costumes don't fall down with all that dancing about!
Sancho
	Ees a rumba or a salsa? Heh heh! I no care.
	But I can no take my eyes away from them!
Tuppence
	I think they're absolutely fantastic. Just look at the way they move in those costumes. Mmmm!
%0%a001240
	That guy looked really intense.
%0%a001250
	Urgh! You won't end up looking all scruffy like him, will you, Dad?
Bianca
	I dun't think I know this song specifically, but it somehow sounds familiar.
Nera
	La la la Ⓠ
	Please, baby, ooh,
	I need you! Ⓠ
%0%a001240
	La la la Ⓠ
	Geez, baby poo...! Ⓠ
%0%a001250
	What a good song!
Tuppence
	Yes, I'd say she's probably the prettiest of them all.
Bianca
	Looks like you think it's pretty classy, eh, %a000090? I can tell by that glazed look in
	your eyes!
Nera
	Darling, do you mind if we go elsewhere? I'm not too keen on being here on the stage.
%0%a001240
	What does ⓗclassyⓘ mean? Is she really good at lessons or something?
%0%a001250
	Look at that costume!
	I'd be really embarrassed if I were her.
Sancho
	Qué!? I no understand...
	Ah! Sí! We need to take a rest from all our hard travelling, no? Ees a good time, eh? Sí, sí.
Tuppence
	Oh, yes. It's very classy.
	Very classy indeed!
Bianca
	I en't lettin' her get the better of me!
	Da-da-daa, Da-da-da-daaa... Ⓠ
Nera
	Stop it, %a000090! It's making me feel funny seeing you watch her tummy button wiggling around like that!
%0%a001240
	Ⓠ Da-da-daa, Da-da-da-daaa...! Ⓠ
	What do you reckon, Dad? Am I any good?
%0%a001250
	Huh. I'm no good at dancing.
Bianca
	Yeah, well, it can't hurt to let go and have a bit of fun every once in a while, eh?
Nera
	He he he! You are rather good.
%0%a001240
	I can do it just as well!
	Watch me!
Bianca
	Um, you know when we're done with all this travellin' and we go back to the castle? I can still wear clothes like these, can't I?
Nera
	But wearing a dress like that must make you feel so pretty and special.
%0%a001240
	That kind of dress would probably really suit %a001250. Especially when she gets a bit older.
%0%a001250
	I'm a princess, but I've never worn a dress like that.
%0%a001240
	Hmm, sounds tricky.
Tuppence
	I suppose I support the lead, so to speak, by accompanying you on your travels, %a000090.
	It's true that it is rather difficult.
Bianca
	That's a good point. Travellin' certainly does broaden the mind.
Nera
	I've met all sorts of people too. Meeting you was the best of all, though.
Tuppence
	I'd like to meet a few more people too. Only the kind of folk who'll make me look good, mind you.
Debora
	This kind of place really doesn't suit me.
	I'm sure Nera would be in her element, though.
Debora
	Oh yes. One of the nuns here helped you out
	once, right?
Debora
	I should probably say a few words of gratitude, then. You know, ⓗthanks for rescuing my servantⓘ, that sort of thing.
Debora
	I can do better than a prince on a white horse.
	I have a servant who also happens to be a king!
Debora
	That reminds me, I haven't seen Mama and Papa in quite a while now.
Debora
	We're going to Mostroferrato, %a000090.
	If we don't go and show them the grandchildren from time to time, they'll never stop moaning.
Debora
	I just can't seem to sleep well here.
	Find us an inn in a town next time, okay?
Debora
	Nera did her domestic goddess training here.
Debora
	Papa tried to get me to come along, but it sounded far too much like hard work to me.
Debora
	I can't believe Nera managed to put up with being in such a lonely place for so long.
Debora
	I couldn't have stood it myself, and not just because it's so lonely.
Debora
	It's been a while since we were last here. It's as bustling as ever. And a bit on the noisy side, just like it always was.
Debora
	The place is bustling now, but apparently it used to be a bit of a ghost town.
Debora
	If a small village can turn into a bustling town, there's hope for you to make something of yourself yet, %a000090.
Debora
	Here I am, doing my best, and yet folk here are hanging about in the casino at all hours.
Debora
	It makes me so angry! I think we should have a bit of fun while we're here too. Just a bit, mind you.
Debora
	I wouldn't give you any grief for going out at night. Unless I felt like it at the time, that is.
Debora
	If it makes battles that much easier, I imagine it would fetch quite a price.
Debora
	Searching for it seems like a bit of a pain, though.
	I'll leave that to you, %a000090. Things like that irritate me too much.
Debora
	It's all well and good being enthusiastic about your business, but he's going to scare people off if he's not careful.
Debora
	He's got some nerve, trying to force a sale on me!
Debora
	If %a001240 was just a normal boy, he'd be running around the castle gardens just like that.
Debora
	I remember Papa wanting one of those a long time ago. Looks like he's not the only one who goes in
	for curiosities.
