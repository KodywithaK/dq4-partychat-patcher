%0%a001240
	Did you see that little room by the entrance, Dad? What do you think it's for?
%0%a001240
	This building's incredible. I can't imagine how
	they managed to build something so huge on
	top of a mountain!
%0%a001240
	Brrr. It's a bit c-c-cold here, isn't it, D-D-Dad?
%0%a001240
	I s-s-suppose it's because we're high up.
	We're even above the c-c-clouds. Brrr.
%0%a001250
	Hahh, hahh, hahh... It's weird. Why am I so out of breath even though I'm not...hahh...doing anything?
%0%a001250
	Hahh, hahh, hahh...
%0%a001250
	Look, Dad! There's a cloud underneath us!
	I've never been this high up before.
Sancho
	A giant temple on the top of Mt Azimuth?
	Ees, ees amazing!
Sancho
	You esee? I am estill just a young man.
	There ees eso much I no know about the world!
Tuppence
	That Zenith Dragon is rather spectacular, being able to fly up above the clouds like this.
Tuppence
	It's hard to believe He's the same creature as that funny Dr Agon we were spending our time with not so long ago.
%0%a001240
	Is that... Is that armour mine?
%0%a001240
	Dad! What are you doing? If that's the Zenithian Armour, then we have to have it!
%0%a001240
	...Oh, I get it. You're planning on going away to get ready first so that we definitely win, right?
	That's really clever.
%0%a001250
	Phew. Looks like we managed to avoid a bit of a
	fight there.
Sancho
	Thees señor, he no realise we are no from thees place like heem, eh?
Sancho
	You have become very clever like thees, friend.
	Sí, you are a master of the tactics now.
%0%a001240
	Why should we be soulless?
	That's a bit of a weird thing to say.
%0%a001250
	Was that soldier a monster?
	Then that means this temple is... Hmm.
Tuppence
	Dear me. He was rather alarming, wasn't he?
%0%a001240
	So this is the armour the legendary hero wore!
	Wow! It's so cool!
%0%a001250
	Does this armour belong to %a001240 now too? That's so unfair! ...Um, I mean, how lovely!
Sancho
	I no expect to find the legendary armour een a
	place like thees.
Tuppence
	Oof! It's rather heavy, isn't it? I suppose that just means I'm not cut out for this kind of armour.
%0%a001240
	Looks like he thinks we're part of the following.
%0%a001250
	What is this place? It's full of lots of really
	strange-looking people.
Sancho
	He can no imagine any other people, they gonna come eenside, eh?
Sancho
	We must pretend we are worshippers eso he no theenk we are esuspicious.
Tuppence
	Tsk tsk! What a useless guard he is, actually encouraging us intruders inside like that!
%0%a001240
	The people in here don't seem to notice us at all.
%0%a001240
	It's like they're all totally mesmerised by something.
%0%a001250
	That person just said something about Mada.
	Isn't Mada Grandma's name too?
Sancho
	Hmm... Sí, your Uncle Sancho, he knows what ees happening here now.
Sancho
	You listen to me, friend. Whatever you esee here, you must no believe eet, okay?
Tuppence
	M-Mada? Surely it couldn't be...?
%0%a001240
	Why should we be soulless?
	That's a bit of a weird thing to say.
%0%a001250
	Was that soldier a monster?
	Then that means this temple is... Hmm.
Sancho
	Sí! Ees true! Ees the monsters! They are een
	control of thees Order of Zugzwang!
Tuppence
	Dear me. He was rather alarming, wasn't he?
%0%a001240
	That kid's eyes looked really empty. It's like he couldn't see properly or something.
Sancho
	Ees no right. He can no esee us, even when we espeak to heem.
%0%a001250
	Do you think that person's okay, Dad?
	The people here are making me nervous.
Tuppence
	It's rather tricky to fathom whether the people here are alive or dead sometimes.
%0%a001240
	That statue almost looks like it's alive.
	...Hang on! I've seen a statue like this before...
%0%a001240
	I know! It looks just like you did when you were a statue! Does that mean...?
%0%a001250
	That lady looks so kind. I feel like I want to hug her for some reason.
Sancho
	Friend!
	Ees, ees your wife!
	Ees %a001230!
Tuppence
	Hmm... What an exquisite-looking lady.
Tuppence
	It's rather odd, though. I can't help feeling like I've seen the same image somewhere before.
%0%a001240
	Can you believe he had the cheek to pretend to
	be Grandma?
%0%a001240
	Huh! Now I'm even more determined than ever.
	I won't rest until the world's at peace again.
%0%a001240
	Everyone seems to have livened up all of a sudden. Do you think that means they're back to normal again?
%0%a001250
	I knew deep down that wasn't really Grandma, but I was a little bit worried that it might be.
%0%a001250
	It's a relief that it wasn't her, but what do you think that nasty monster meant when he said she's not part of this world any more?
%0%a001250
	Maybe we should try having a word with everyone here, Dad. We might be able to find out something useful.
Sancho
	You no have time to feel the blues, friend.
Sancho
	You must concentrate and theenk of a way to esave %a001230.
Sancho
	Sí, thees señora Mada, eshe was just a monster. But estill... Now you can be esure your madre, eshe ees een the underworld.
Tuppence
	The God-King, Korol... No doubt the time will come when we have to pit our strength against him.
%0%a001240
	No way! So this Korol character placed a curse on Mum as well as turning her into a statue?
%0%a001240
	Do you think the curse will be lifted if we manage to defeat him?
%0%a001250
	So...that really is Mum, then?
Tuppence
	Fancy not even realising that the legendary hero was born years ago. These monster types are terribly ignorant.
%0%a001250
	Isn't that boy the one from the house where you stayed when you were a statue, Dad? It's great that we were able to rescue him.
Sancho
	Ees, ees eso wonderful news! Hees papá, he ees gonna be eso, eso happy! (sniff)
Tuppence
	It could be quite tricky for him to get home from here, though, couldn't it? I wonder how he'll manage.
%0%a001240
	A hidden staircase? We should go and find it
	right away!
%0%a001250
	Have you been to this place before, Dad?
	Hmm, I had a feeling you had.
Sancho
	The estage?
	He means the place where ees the estatue of señora %a001230, no?
%0%a001250
	You have to accept people's thanks gracefully and tell them it was no trouble. That's manners.
Sancho
	Esacrificed? Sí, when the temple ees completed, all the eslaves, they gonna be keelled.
Tuppence
	I'd wager that she's rather a lovely specimen when she's smartened up a bit. It's all in the cheek bones, you know.
%0%a001240
	Quite a few people seem to be a bit dazed.
	I hope they'll be alright.
Sancho
	Ees, ees eso esad... These señores and señoras, they have been lied to for eso long.
%0%a001250
	The people up here must've been the important
	ones, then.
Tuppence
	If Korol took a liking to him, that probably means he did lots of evil things here.
%0%a001240
	So the stairs were right in the middle of the stage. That's a bit easy to find, considering it was supposed to be a hidden staircase!
%0%a001250
	We have to hurry up and help Mum.
	I'm going to try really hard to do my bit.
Sancho
	You must be careful, friend. Your Uncle Sancho, he has a bad feeling, you know.
%0%a001240
	He must be a right coward to have built a secret staircase and hidden himself down here!
%0%a001250
	What's wrong, Dad? You look a bit troubled.
%0%a001250
	Of course... This is the place where you were made to work as a slave all those years ago.
Sancho
	Anda! Ees thees place you were...
Sancho
	Sí, but now you are back again.
	Ees esome kind of destiny, no?
Tuppence
	Don't worry about me. I'm happy to follow you wherever you go, %a000090!
%0%a001240
	This place is pretty huge. And the monsters here are more than a bit scary too.
%0%a001240
	Oh! I'm totally lost now. You'll have to figure out which way we need to go, Dad.
%0%a001250
	This place is like a labyrinth. You have to plan your next move really carefully otherwise you get lost.
%0%a001250
	This place is really hard to get around. I wonder why they made it this way. Don't the monsters
	get lost?
Sancho
	Ees eso much work to build a place eso beeg under the ground like thees, eh?
Sancho
	Anda! You no feel dizzy when you walk around een the circles like thees?
Tuppence
	Hmph. These complicated paths are becoming really rather irritating.
Tuppence
	I'll just follow your lead, %a000090. I'm sure you'll be able to guide us through this place.
%0%a001240
	Looks like all the soldiers in this place are monsters. We'd better be careful, Dad.
%0%a001250
	Yikes! That's scary! It sounds like the monsters here have been feasting on the slaves.
Sancho
	The best theeng, ees no to be found by
	the guards, sí? You must take muchos
	care for thees.
%0%a001240
	We're almost there.
	Korol can't be far away now.
%0%a001250
	We must be careful, Dad. I'm sensing something evil down below.
Sancho
	Thees monster, he no realise he told us that thees Korol, he ees near here.
Sancho
	Friend! Ees time to regain your estrength, no?
	Then we go eento battle! Olé!
%0%a001240
	That poor man! He must've been desperate,
	writing something like that in the hope that she'd
	read it one day.
%0%a001250
	Dear Goddess,
	Please grant this tormented soul peace within your safe haven. Amen.
Sancho
	Come, friend. We pray, okay?
Tuppence
	I don't have any brothers or sisters, but I can still feel this poor chap's pain. What a way to go.
%0%a001240
	We are going the right way, aren't we?
	I'm not too sure...
%0%a001250
	I feel like we keep going round and round in circles. Everywhere seems to look the same.
Sancho
	You are lost, sí, friend?
Tuppence
	How to find our way around this place is a complete mystery. I've never seen anywhere so complicated.
%0%a001240
	Up and down, big spaces and tiny spaces...
	This place is such a mishmash!
%0%a001250
	Um, do you think I've got a bit stronger, Dad?
	Am I being of any use to you?
Sancho
	You know, friend, esince we find thees estatue of señora %a001230, you no look the esame.
Sancho
	You no geeve up now! Ees time to fight!
	Eef you no fight now, when do you fight, eh?
Tuppence
	Where is this confounded Korol fellow anyway?
	I hope he doesn't just pop out and catch us unawares.
%0%a001240
	I can sense a really strange aura. Wow! It's the strongest one I've felt yet, that's for sure.
%0%a001250
	Um... Is it okay if I hold your hand, Dad?
	I'm a little bit scared.
Sancho
	Are you ready, friend?
Tuppence
	We won't let anyone get the better of us. No one can! I hope...
%0%a001240
	Hahh... Hahh... That Korol guy was really strong.
%0%a001240
	And then that Ladja character appeared.
	I can hardly get my head around it all.
%0%a001240
	You did pick up that ring, didn't you, Dad?
	I wonder where it came from. It's so shiny.
%0%a001250
	I hate Ladja! We'll have to make sure we give him a good hiding next time!
%0%a001250
	Is it okay if I have a bit of a look at that ring?
%0%a001250
	It's strange, but just holding it makes me feel all warm inside.
%0%a001250
	Sorry. I shouldn't have asked.
Sancho
	Aargh! Thees Ladja, he must pay for señor Pankraz! Next time, we no gonna let heem
	get away.
Sancho
	Ees estrange. When I look at thees ring, I can no help but to theenk of señora Mada.
Sancho
	Maybe ees just because we esee thees fake señora Mada before.
Tuppence
	Thank the Goddess I'm still alive! Even in the face
	of such a trying battle, Tuppence survives to fight another day!
Tuppence
	Well, we should be heading back to that big room so we can try to figure out how to bring %a001230 back to life.
%0%a001240
	I don't sense any monsters about.
	Maybe Korol was in charge of them all.
%0%a001250
	It's so much easier to walk about with no monsters coming and getting in our way. If only it could always be like this.
Sancho
	We were told señora Mada, eshe ees een the underworld, no?
Sancho
	Uf! Our quest, how long ees gonna last?
Tuppence
	What a gift it is that there are no monsters around. We should make the most of it and check there aren't any treasure chests we've missed.
%0%a001240
	D-Do you think that was really Grandma's voice we could hear?
%0%a001240
	She said even the legendary hero can't take on Grandmaster Nimzo, but surely that can't be right?
%0%a001250
	Grandma sounded so kind and gentle...
%0%a001250
	Oh! I wish I could speak to her more. There's so much I want to talk to her about.
Sancho
	I...!
	Ees...!
	Señora Madaaa!
Sancho
	Her words, eso full of love...
	You no forget these words, friend. Never!
Tuppence
	Ah yes. A mother always puts the safety and needs of her children first.
Tuppence
	My mother's just the same.
%0%a001240
	Now I'm totally confused about what we should do.
%0%a001240
	I mean, I can understand how you feel, Dad.
	But I can see where Grandma's coming from too.
%0%a001250
	Oh! I really wish I could get to meet Grandma.
Sancho
	Thees time I no gonna esay anytheeng.
	You theenk for yourself what you gonna do.
Sancho
	But you no theenk I am cold, okay?
	You are the king of Gotha, My Majesty.
	You can no rely on your Uncle Sancho forever.
Tuppence
	I'll have to give my old mum a nice shoulder rub when I go home to Gotha.
Tuppence
	I'm probably causing her no end of worry and stress at the moment, so it's the least I can do.
Bianca
	Aah... This is the temple I spent all them years in, stood stock-still as a statue.
Bianca
	Ha ha! This'll probably sound quite daft, but I almost feel a bit sentimental about the place.
Nera
	I hardly remember anything at all about those years I spent here as a statue.
Nera
	Maybe I was asleep most of the time.
%0%a001240
	What's up, Dad? What are we doing here?
%0%a001240
	We've rescued Mum now, so we don't have anything left to do here, right?
%0%a001250
	This is the place we had our reunion with Mum.
	But I'd still rather not come here.
%0%a001250
	Now she's with us again, I don't see the point in being reminded of those sad times without her.
Sancho
	We no have time to walk like a dog, friend.
	When you are travelling, you must always
	know where you are going and go there.
Tuppence
	I'd heard rumours about the Order of Zugzwang, of course. I always had a feeling there was something suspicious about them.
Debora
	So this is where I spent all those years as a statue.
Debora
	I don't remember it very clearly, but I have this impression that everyone was kneeling before me.
