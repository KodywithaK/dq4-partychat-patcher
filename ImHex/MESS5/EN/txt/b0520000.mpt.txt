Bianca
	Wow! What a wonderful inn this is, built around such a lovely big tree!
Nera
	What a lovely idea, building an inn around a nice old tree like this. It would be wonderful if we could stay here tonight.
Bianca
	It's a bit of an odd place. I don't think I've bin to an inn where a bunny girl greets you before!
Nera
	I wonder what kind of offer it is they're running. How exciting!
Bianca
	I'm really enjoyin' this journey of ours, %a000090. It's great fun travellin' about with you.
Nera
	I know we only get to live life once. That's why I want to go with you wherever you go and experience everything with you.
Bianca
	It's a nice touch, havin' the branch comin' up
	from the floor like that. Dad would love to see this place!
Nera
	It's so nice seeing branches from the tree indoors as well as outdoors. It's somehow very relaxing.
Bianca
	A group of four... Let's get everyone together and do it right away, %a000090!
Nera
	I wonder what this special gift is. I hope it's something nice.
Bianca
	So...this is the amazin' special gift!?
Nera
	A flag...!? It's not exactly the prettiest thing I've ever seen, but I suppose it won't hurt to take it with us.
Bianca
	A blast? I wouldn't go that far! At least it's all over with now, anyway.
Nera
	He looks so pleased with himself, don't you think? I wonder why he's so happy for the offer to be over.
Bianca
	Sounds like we have to cross a mountain pass to get to Gotha. But we'll be fine as long as we have a good rest first.
Nera
	I think I've become a lot stronger than I was, travelling around together like this. I'm sure I'll cope with a spot of mountaineering.
Bianca
	A sinister feeling?
	I dun't much like the sound of that.
Nera
	Oh dear. I wonder if that means something bad has happened in Gotha. What a worry!
Bianca
	Sounds like Granny Knot's son is a bit of a clumsy one. I wonder what made him think sewin' would be a good idea!
Nera
	At least the poor man's finished with it all now.
Nera
	It must be a relief for everyone else not to have to hear him suffering while he works too!
Debora
	What an enormous tree! I've never travelled all that much, so it's the first time I've ever seen anything like this. It's amazing!
Debora
	Why are you looking surprised? I have my moments of being impressed every now and then, you know!
Debora
	I suppose bunny girl outfits aren't all that bad.
	Perhaps you should try one on one day, %a000090!
Debora
	Absolutely. You only live once, so you should just do whatever you want whenever you want.
Debora
	This room's really quite nice. That's decided then. We're staying here tonight. And that's an order.
Debora
	I'm not interested in their silly special offer, but this looks like it wouldn't be a bad place to stay.
Debora
	The flag's yours.
Debora
	I don't go much for ugly handmade things, but you probably like it, right? So take it and be grateful!
Debora
	Mountaineering? Hmm, maybe these aren't the best shoes for that.
Debora
	Not to worry. If my feet start to hurt, I've always got my personal slave to carry me, right, %a000090?
Debora
	I always have a sinister feeling whenever I go on Papa's casino ship, the Ventuno.
Debora
	And for some reason I always leave the place with no money. Just goes to show you should listen to your instincts.
Debora
	You may not believe it, but I've done some sewing in my time. Three whole buttons I sewed on! But then I got bored and got the maid to finish it.
Debora
	I doubt anyone came to stay here just because of his silly special offer.
Debora
	What do you mean, we did? Hardly! I just wanted to stay here, that's all. You may have wanted the ⓗspecialⓘ gift, but I was never interested one bit!
