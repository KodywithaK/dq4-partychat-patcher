*: 
	Welcome to the weapon shop.
	What can I do for you?
*: 
	What do you need?
*: 
	Sorry, you don't seem to have enough money for that.
*: 
	%0%a040100, is it?
	Thank you very much.
*: 
	%a000840 %a010100?
	Thank you very much.
*: 
	Have a go at using %H0840%X%M0100%Xthem%Yit%Z as an item in battle. %M0100%XThey%YIt%Z%Yone of them as an item in battle. They%Z can be quite effective.
*: 
	Who's going to carry the goods?
*: 
	Into the bag it is, then!
*: 
	You can't carry any more, %a000180.
	Would you like me to reorganise your items?
*: 
	Okay! I've sorted things out for you.
*: 
	Seems you're carrying a lot of important items, %a000180. It wouldn't be right for me to organise them!
*: 
	Can someone else carry the goods?
*: 
	Do you want to equip %M0100%Xthem%Yit%Z now?
*: 
	That's the spirit! You'd be daft not to equip something after you've spent good money on it!
~ %0%a000180 equips %a020100! ~
*: 
	You can't equip this particular item, %a000180. Do you still want it?
*: 
	Here you go, %a000180!
*: 
	I'll just place the goods in %a000180's coffin, then.
*: 
	Okay. I'll make sure the goods get to %a000180 in the wagon, then.
*: 
	I'll put the remaining item%H0880%X%Ys%Z in your bag, then.
*: 
	Can I help you with anything else?
*: 
	Who wants to sell something?
*: 
	Really? But you're not carrying anything, %a000180!
*: 
	But your bag's empty!
*: 
	Sorry, I'm not interested in things like that.
*: 
	Besides, there are some things you're better off hanging on to.
*: 
	A word of warning: if you sell %H0840%X%M0100%Xthose%Ythat%Z%Ythose%Z, you might never be able to get %H0840%X%M0100%Xthem%Yit%Z%Ythem%Z back. Is that okay?
*: 
	%0%a040100? I'll give you %a000620 gold coin%H0620%X%Ys%Z for it. Okay?
*: 
	How many do you want to sell?
*: 
	%a000840 %a010100? I'll give you %a000620 gold coin%H0620%X%Ys%Z for them. Okay?
*: 
	Oh well, that's a shame.
*: 
	It amazes me to say this, but you can't carry any more gold!
*: 
	Why don't you buy something from me first?
*: 
	Pleasure doing business with you!
*: 
	Would you like to sell anything else?
*: 
	Anything else I can help you with?
*: 
	Come again!
