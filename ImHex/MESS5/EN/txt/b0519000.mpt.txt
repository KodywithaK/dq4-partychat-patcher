Debora
	I'd never be able to sleep in a place like this.
	You probably knew that already, though.
Debora
	Argh! That noise really gets on my nerves.
	We're leaving, %a000090. Now!
Debora
	Prince Harry is a good friend of my servant's. Ha! It's nice to have something to gloat over like that.
Debora
	I always drink plenty of water after I've had a bath. They say it's good for keeping you
	looking beautiful.
Debora
	He really wants to keep that drink a secret, doesn't he? You'd think he'd have honed his lying technique a bit more, though.
Debora
	This is where the Circle of Fire was hidden, isn't it? It's a pretty apt location for it, given its name.
Debora
	It's so hot in here! I suppose that's to be expected of a volcano.
Debora
	I'll have to get out of here soon. It's good to sweat a little to clean out your pores, but there are limits.
Debora
	Who'd have thought there'd be a cave like this hidden behind the waterfall? And...I suppose it's quite pretty as caves go.
Debora
	This is where the Circle of Water was, isn't it?
	It's quite a pretty place, but it's a bit on the chilly side. Maybe because of the water.
Debora
	Will you come here a minute, %a000090?
Debora
	Ah, much better! Now I'm not cold at all.
	It can't hurt to share a bit of body heat for a while...
Debora
	Surely you're not shy!?
	Never mind. I'll go to you.
Debora
	Well? Much warmer, don't you think?
	It can't hurt to share a bit of body heat for a while...
Debora
	So they reckon the only one who can open these doors is a maiden with the blessing of the Goddess?
Debora
	That means you must've found yourself a maiden if you've been in there before. You'll have to tell me about that one day.
Debora
	This is a mysterious place. Nera would be thrilled to see something like this. Me? I'm not that bothered.
Debora
	I wonder why you can't pass through at night.
	Do you think the place on the other side is too dangerous or something?
Debora
	I think I've heard about this place. About there being a castle somewhere in the world that's almost falling to pieces. I wonder if it's here.
Debora
	A castle with no people in it feels really strange.
	I don't mean I'm scared or anything.
Debora
	Urgh! It's so dusty in here. There's a bit of a chill in the air too, unless I'm imagining it.
Debora
	So you came here when you were little?
Debora
	Ha ha! You came ⓗghost bustingⓘ?
	Very funny!
Debora
	You must've been either brave or stupid, coming to explore such a creepy castle. Especially at night!
Debora
	What? There used to be coffins where those beds are? And skeletons...?
Debora
	Hah! If you think talk like that's going to scare me, %a000090, you've got another thing coming.
Debora
	I didn't see a thing.
	Not a thing, I tell you!
Debora
	Ah, love across boundaries...
	Just like us. The servant and his boss.
	We seem to be doing okay, though.
Debora
	The only thing left when you die is your grave. They can only enjoy their lives together if they're alive.
Debora
	That Bianca was buried alive here!?
Debora
	For goodness' sake, %a000090! If you carry on with silly stories like that, I'll bury YOU alive!
Debora
	Um, %a000090...If I happen to...you know...before you...um... Never mind!
Debora
	I can't seem to focus on that man very well.
	I must be tired.
Debora
	%0%a000090, I do hope you've dragged me out to the middle of nowhere for a good reason.
Debora
	I suppose all they see is that %a001210 destroyed their crops, so it stands to reason that they're scared to see us with him.
Debora
	How dare he! I have plenty of money of my own, thank you very much. I don't need to sink to those levels for their grubby small change!
Debora
	You take care of this, okay?
Debora
	I don't want their stupid money! And they don't have to tell me to leave. I'll do it gladly! Come on, %a000090. I've had enough!
Debora
	That's weird. Why doesn't it want to attack me?
	Am I not alluring enough?
Debora
	Wait! Why's it so transfixed on you?
	It's usually me who stops people in their tracks!
Debora
	What? You know this beast from when you were small? I hope you're not trying to make a fool of me.
Debora
	I like this place. I'd like to climb up to the highest point and look down on all the people.
Bianca
	This is where that mate of yours lives, en't it? Harry, I mean.
Bianca
	But now we've found the Circle of Water, we'd best hurry up an' get it to Nera.
