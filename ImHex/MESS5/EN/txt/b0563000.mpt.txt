Bianca
	So this is Lofty Peak... This is where your mum was born and raised.
Nera
	There's a very mysterious air to this village.
	It feels like more of a holy place than an
	inhabited settlement.
%0%a001240
	It's quiet here as usual, isn't it?
	It makes me feel a bit nervous.
%0%a001250
	It's been a while since we were last here.
	I wonder how everyone is.
Sancho
	We must ask many people about thees underworld. We must find out as much as we can.
Sancho
	But ees no eso easy to walk around een thees town, eh? These eslopes, they are no good for my back, you know.
Sancho
	I know you want to talk weeth the village elders, but ees no the time now. We must hurry to the underworld.
Tuppence
	In some ways, it's harder walking around this village than it is walking around a cave.
Bianca
	How sad that they've bin forgotten!
Nera
	I suppose it's only to be expected that they'd be forgotten, living all the way out here. It is a bit sad for them, though.
%0%a001250
	The forgotten ones? It'd be horrible to be forgotten. You won't forget me, will you, Dad?
%0%a001240
	I never forget places I've been, even if I've only been once. I wonder who the people here have
	been forgotten by.
Bianca
	Oh yeah. You lot have bin here before, eh?
Nera
	Of course. You've been here already. It doesn't seem like they have many visitors, so you probably stood out quite a lot.
%0%a001240
	Ha ha! I wonder if it was my face she remembered. How cool is that!?
Tuppence
	Dear me! She obviously just can't get me out of
	her head!
Tuppence
	...Hm? What is it, %a000090?
	Why are you looking at me like that?
Bianca
	If that key really exists, we'd do well to get hold
	of it.
Nera
	Dear me! A key that can open any door in the hands of a master thief, of all people!
%0%a001240
	M. Bezzler? That's a weird name.
%0%a001240
	If we had that key, maybe we'd be able to open that door in the cave on the way here.
%0%a001250
	Why do you suppose that poet's looking for the key? You don't think he's planning on becoming a thief, do you?
Tuppence
	If only such a key were mine, I could unlock the door to a beautiful woman's heart...
Tuppence
	I'm only joking! Just ignore me.
Bianca
	He said he's bin lookin' for it, and yet he didn't seem fed up we had it. How weird!
Nera
	Do you think this key really can open any door?
	How amazing!
%0%a001240
	It was pretty hard work getting hold of that key, wasn't it, Dad?
Sancho
	You esee, friend? Esome people, they use the good theengs een the bad ways. You must no be a filibuster weeth thees key, okay?
Bianca
	Lodestar Harbour? We went there together ages ago, eh? That really takes me back!
Nera
	We set sail from Lodestar Harbour just after we were married, didn't we? Aah, happy memories.
%0%a001250
	Maybe we'd find out more about this weird-sounding M. Bezzler character if we went there.
Sancho
	Hmm... I theenk ees a good idea you remember what thees señor, he esays now. You understand, friend?
Bianca
	Lodestar Harbour? We went there together ages ago, eh? That really takes me back!
Nera
	We set sail from Lodestar Harbour just after we were married, didn't we? Aah, happy memories.
%0%a001240
	Huh? Do we know about him? I don't remember hearing about him before.
%0%a001240
	We're not here to find out about truth and reason. We're here to find out about Nadiria.
%0%a001250
	Yikes! We're so high up! How come the people
	here aren't scared, even though there are no rails or anything?
Sancho
	You know, ees very high up here.
	Thees village, ees een a scary place, sí?
Bianca
	How old are you now, %a000090?
Bianca
	Your mum must've bin fightin' all them years since you were born to keep the monsters at bay.
Nera
	I can understand why your mother wants to protect you like she does.
Nera
	But I'm sure we can be of help to her if we keep pushing on. Together, we can do anything!
%0%a001250
	It's not fair! There are loads of monsters about who aren't evil. They can't help it if some of them get ordered to do bad things.
Sancho
	Sí. Ees true. After thees, señor Pankraz, he decided to leave on the quest to find her.
Sancho
	The quest from which he never
	would return...
Sancho
	Hahh...hahh... Hahh...hahh...
	Perdón, friend. Hahh...
	I can no ⓚⓛ hahh ⓚⓛ espeak now...
%0%a001240
	Wow! Look! Just look at how far you can see from up here!
%0%a001250
	I'm too scared to look down!
Tuppence
	I wonder if anyone's plummeted to their death from up here.
Bianca
	Wow! This place really is surrounded by mountains.
Nera
	Can you hold my hand, darling? I feel a bit nervous being so high up.
%0%a001250
	Look how pretty the sky is! I'm going to keep looking up at it, so you'll have to guide me, okay, Dad?
%0%a001240
	It's funny that he's not scared, standing on the edge like that. %0%a001250 would be crying with fear if she were him!
Sancho
	We, we must believe the words of the elders.
	We have notheeng else, sí, friend?
Tuppence
	Nadiria... Hearing it again makes it all seems
	scarily real. I, er, I seem to be shaking.
Bianca
	I had no idea your mum had powers like that.
Bianca
	That must be why Grandmaster Nimzo took her away. He was afraid of what she could do.
Nera
	It doesn't sound like there's anyone who could take your mother's place. What a terrible burden for her.
%0%a001250
	If we stay here, maybe we'll dream about Grandma. That'd be nice.
Nera
	So the inn's right in the middle of the village.
	It's helpful of them to have it in such an easy
	place to reach.
%0%a001240
	I wonder if Grandma ever stayed here.
%0%a001240
	Oh, I suppose not. If she lived in the village, then she wouldn't need a room at the inn. Silly me!
Bianca
	It's very snug, but it's a lovely room. You probably have brilliant dreams when you stay here.
Sancho
	Even here, there are weapon and armour eshops. But they no eseem to go well here, you no theenk?
%0%a001240
	There's a proper shopkeeper and everything, but I wonder if there are ever any customers.
Bianca
	This is a pretty big shop.
	D'you reckon they do alright here?
Nera
	A shop in a place like this is always bound to have lots of weird and wonderful things on sale.
%0%a001240
	It sounds like the people here don't often visit the outside world. That must be a bit lonely.
%0%a001250
	That old woman always looks really sad.
	I wonder what's wrong with her.
Sancho
	But señora Mada, eshe was eso happy weeth señor Pankraz!
Sancho
	Anda! I theenk ees gonna take a long, long time before the people here, they understand thees.
%0%a001240
	That's Grandpa Pankraz!
	Good for him!
Tuppence
	Hopefully it won't be too long for me now...
	Er, nothing. Never mind.
%0%a001250
	Um, if I suddenly decided to get married, would you be lonely?
%0%a001250
	Okay then, I won't do that.
%0%a001250
	You'd be happy? Then maybe I should have a whirlwind romance and get married just like Grandma Mada did!
Bianca
	So that's how it all happened. It sounds like it was really romantic between your folks, %a000090.
Nera
	I've always thought it was fate, the way we met
	like we did. It sounds like it was fate for your parents too.
Bianca
	Openin' the gateway to Nadiria will be no mean feat, eh? But I'm sure we'll manage.
Nera
	Sealed shut for centuries? That sounds like it could be tricky to open. But we have to give it a try.
%0%a001240
	I'm not going to give up. We've had our hard times up to now that we've won through, and we will again this time!
%0%a001250
	Oh, that's the man who gave us the flying carpet.
Sancho
	But weeth the blood of señora Mada and of Gotha een your veins, everytheeng, eet ees possible, sí?
Sancho
	Ees a miracle! We have found the missing craftsman of Gotha! I never expected to find heem here!
%0%a001240
	It's nice to meet people who like Grandpa Pankraz and Grandma Mada so much.
%0%a001250
	But Grandpa Pankraz is definitely dead, right? Killed right before your very eyes... Oh! (sob)
Tuppence
	Aah! So that's the famous craftsman from Gotha!
	Well, well, well!
Sancho
	Ees a miracle! We have found the missing craftsman of Gotha! I never expected to find heem here!
%0%a001240
	Yay! I can't wait until tomorrow!
%0%a001250
	Do you think he can really turn a plain old stone into something beautiful? Really!?
Tuppence
	So we'll soon see the work of a famous craftsman.
	I don't know that I'll be able to get a wink of
	sleep tonight.
Sancho
	Ees a miracle! We have found the missing craftsman of Gotha! I never expected to find heem here!
Tuppence
	Goodness! That's incredible! Who'd have thought that an old bit of rock like that could be transformed into something so exquisite?
Sancho
	Sí, sí! Thees ees a true craftsman.
	When you esee the fine work like thees, you no feel like the artisans, they are dying, eh?
%0%a001250
	It's so pretty! Do you think this was hidden inside the stone all along? Wow!
%0%a001240
	That was worth doing, wasn't it, Dad? It's
	very pretty. You should probably use it to
	decorate something.
Sancho
	Sí, sí... Señor Pankraz, he was loved by everyone.
	He was, was... (sob)
Sancho
	The artist from Lofty Peak...?
	Eef he was taken by the Goddess...
Sancho
	Thees means ees no possible to complete the locket of señora Mada.
%0%a001240
	So someone here pledged allegiance to Grandpa?
	I would've liked to have met him.
Bianca
	Everyone loved Pankraz over in Whealbrook too, eh? He was so kind and so strong...
%0%a001240
	Those Elders know everything we're up to without us having to say a word!
%0%a001250
	Do you think the Estuary Sanctuary is the thing we passed in the cave on the way here?
Bianca
	En't these the folk that are supposed to guard
	the gateway?
Bianca
	Then he must know what he's talkin' about.
Nera
	Then I wonder how Mada managed to enter Nadiria. Maybe Grandmaster Nimzo took her himself...
Tuppence
	They may call themselves ⓗEldersⓘ, but they're actually quite young and splendid-looking.
	How odd!
%0%a001240
	The Zenith Dragon is Dr Agon, right?
%0%a001240
	It's hard to really tell if he's all that powerful or not.
%0%a001250
	It's amazing that the effect of something we
	did is being felt all the way out here in the
	middle of the mountains.
Sancho
	Ees because of señor Agon, sí?
	We must esay gracias to heem, no?
Tuppence
	That means now's the perfect time to go in after him and knock him for six!
Nera
	I suppose that means we can breathe a small sigh of relief for now.
Bianca
	Three great circles...
	First we have to get hold of 'em.
Bianca
	It'd be handy if we already had 'em, eh?
Nera
	I wonder how we offer up these great circles.
%0%a001240
	Sounds easier than we thought to open the gateway, doesn't it?
%0%a001250
	So this was Grandma's room. It's nice and big, but it's got a bit of a lonely feel to it.
Sancho
	Ees a book of psalms? A book your madre, señora Mada, eshe used to read, sí? You must
	keep thees memento esafe, friend.
%0%a001240
	Did you notice that this room's the highest room in
	the village?
%0%a001240
	It's a bit like in faerie stories where they have the princess locked up in the highest room of a tower!
Tuppence
	A book of psalms? I'm sure it will be of use to us in times of need. If only those up on high would be there for us...
Bianca
	What a huge room! Looks like Mada was thought of as someone really special 'round here.
%0%a001250
	So this was Grandma's room. It's nice and big, but it's got a bit of a lonely feel to it.
Sancho
	Sí. Señora Mada, eshe has the beeg heart.
	Beeg, estrong and beautiful.
%0%a001240
	What does she mean by light in your heart?
	Is that the same as just being light-hearted?
Bianca
	Your mum said it right, eh, %a000090?
	We mustn't lose hope!
Nera
	I've had light in my heart ever since the day I met you. You're the light of my life, darling.
Bianca
	So this is Lofty Peak... This is where your mum was born and raised.
Nera
	There's a very mysterious air to this village.
	It feels like more of a holy place than an
	inhabited settlement.
%0%a001240
	It's quiet here as usual, isn't it?
	It makes me feel a bit nervous.
%0%a001250
	Zzz... Yes, yes... I'm...awake...
Sancho
	Ees late, sí? We no go for the siesta yet?
	Early to bed, early to rise. Thees ees the best way, you know.
Tuppence
	Aah, I'm rather tired today.
	Er, no, no! I'm fine! Fit as a fiddle!
%0%a001240
	I wonder what food they'll be serving at the inn tonight. I'm starving!
Bianca
	How sad that they've bin forgotten!
Nera
	I suppose it's only to be expected that they'd be forgotten, living all the way out here. It is a bit sad for them, though.
%0%a001250
	The forgotten ones? It'd be horrible to be forgotten. You won't forget me, will you, Dad?
%0%a001240
	I never forget places I've been, even if I've only been once. I wonder who the people here have
	been forgotten by.
Sancho
	Sí, sí. The elder peoples, they are always going to bed early. We come back een the morning, okay?
%0%a001250
	Sancho said it's rude to visit people too late in
	the evening.
Bianca
	Time for bed now, I think. It's dangerous walkin' about this place in the dark. Imagine if you stepped over the edge!
Nera
	What a pity! Fancy not being able to see them after that scary journey up here in the dark!
%0%a001240
	I'm not scared of night-time! I don't wet the bed any more, so what's there to be afraid of?
	...I don't wet it, honest!
%0%a001250
	I know how he feels. Scary creatures come out at night. You can hear their footsteps...
Bianca
	I wonder what'll happen if we dun't manage to defeat the Grandmaster.
Bianca
	Listen to me! I mustn't talk like that, eh?
	There's nothin' we can't do if we all stick 
	together as a family!
Nera
	It could be quite beautiful, a night-time land of only stars and moons...
Nera
	But the idea of a night-time land full of scary monsters isn't quite so appealing.
Debora
	One, two, three... Nope, counting them is boring.
	Just how many stairs do you suppose there
	are here?
Debora
	They shouldn't call themselves the forgotten ones.
Debora
	It's disrespectful to people like me who've come all this way to visit the place.
Debora
	She remembers you! That's weird. I wouldn't have thought you'd be that memorable without me by
	your side.
Debora
	We should take a good look at him and remember his face for future reference. He could well end up becoming a thief.
Debora
	Wow! He seems impressed! We should flash it about a bit and see what he'd do to have the chance to lay his hands on it.
Debora
	Lodestar Harbour's the place we set sail from back when you were an unaccomplished servant.
Debora
	Er... What about him? Remind me.
Debora
	Truth and reason? What's he on about? I think you'd better do the talking with this lot, %a000090.
	I can't get on with people who speak in riddles.
Debora
	Your mother was a strong woman. She carried on fighting even though she knew she was in danger.
Debora
	Haah... Haah...
	Why do you look so unruffled?
	I order you to at least look a little bit tired!
Debora
	Sounds like even the elders didn't have the necessary powers to take your mother's place.
Debora
	The nerve of Nimzo, snatching her away like that! We'll make him pay, don't you worry.
Debora
	This inn's very appealing. By which I mean the place, not the price.
Debora
	I like this inn. We're staying here tonight.
Debora
	I adore shopping! Just look at this shop! They probably have some lovely dresses on sale.
Debora
	Papa never had that problem.
	That's because he trusts me.
Debora
	So you inherited your recklessness from your parents. Now it all makes sense.
Debora
	It's only stayed sealed shut because no one could open it. Don't let him put you off. Let's go!
Debora
	Let's hurry up and get to the gateway to Nadiria.
Debora
	If it's been sealed shut for centuries, it's probably rusty and in need of some work by now.
Debora
	If Nimzo came along and started to destroy my favourite shop, then I'd really lose my temper.
Debora
	ⓗThree great circlesⓘ...
	Do you think it's referring to these?
Debora
	This book of psalms is really easy to read.
	The words just seem to sink in somehow.
	Other books like this usually just irritate me.
Debora
	In other words, the reason the darkness can't get the better of me is that I have light in my heart!
Debora
	I don't have the energy for any more stairs today. Let's carry on exploring tomorrow.
Debora
	They shouldn't call themselves the forgotten ones.
Debora
	It's disrespectful to people like me who've come all this way to visit the place.
Debora
	Are you deaf or something? I said we'd carry on exploring tomorrow!
Debora
	Perpetual night would mean the end of the world as we know it.
Debora
	There's no need to fret over what'll never happen, though. We'll defeat Nimzo and put a stop to it.
