Bianca
	So we're finally off to Gotha.
	Are you ready to leave, %a000090?
Nera
	Time for us to make a move at last. There's
	no need to worry about me. I feel fine after
	that rest.
Bianca
	It's all downhill to Gotha, so hopefully it shouldn't be too tirin' a journey.
Nera
	There seem to be an awful lot of monsters about. Do be careful, won't you?
Bianca
	Did you see that insignia by the stairs? I wonder if that had somethin' to do with Gotha.
Nera
	I can't believe one of Papa's messengers would come all the way out to this cave of all places!
Bianca
	He's a bit of a scaremonger, eh? It would help if he told us what happened to him if he's goin' to dish out advice like that.
Nera
	It can't be helped. No matter what that man says, we have to keep pushing onwards.
Bianca
	Looks like that peddler fell down too, eh? What a pain havin' to go all the way back again.
Nera
	Oh dear! That was a bit of a shock! I wonder if there are other places you can't reach unless you take a flying leap!
Bianca
	I'm startin' to get used to this jumpin' about the place. We'd better watch out for places where the light shines in, eh?
Nera
	Ouch! I think I might've bruised my...er, behind, when we dropped down that last time.
Bianca
	I hope we're doin' the right thing, droppin' about left, right and centre. We probably couldn't get back to Battenberg now if we wanted to.
Nera
	I don't think I've ever visited a cave that's had me on tenterhooks as much as this one. Travelling isn't all fun, is it?
Bianca
	Um, %a000090...
	I think there's a chance I might be...
Bianca
	Um. Never mind.
	Just forget I said anything.
Nera
	Thanks for being so considerate of me and asking how I feel all the time. You needn't worry. I feel fine, honestly.
Bianca
	I've totally lost track of what level we're on after all that jumpin' about.
Bianca
	Of course! Now would probably be a good
	time to use that compass. What was it called? The Batten binnacle?
Nera
	I was expecting the road to Gotha to be mountainous, but I didn't think it would
	be all caves.
Nera
	I feel totally losⓚⓛ Wait a minute! Maybe that compass we have, the Batten binnacle, would be of some use!
Bianca
	There are so many stairs here.
	We're bound to get lost.
Nera
	I'm glad you're here with me. I'm sure I'd never find my way out of here if I were alone.
Bianca
	You should be careful not to go droppin' things about the place, %a000090! I dun't remember droppin' that, mind.
Nera
	What a nice old man, finding our belongings for us like that. I'm not sure we dropped it in the first place, mind you.
Bianca
	%0%a000090! That flowin' dress en't ours! You mustn't tell lies like that!
Nera
	You really shouldn't tell fibs like that. It's wicked. You know that flowing dress doesn't really belong to us.
Bianca
	Wow! Look at all these things we've got! Just goes to show honesty's the best policy!
Nera
	I do hope it's alright for us to take all these things off that old man. Wasn't he generous!
Bianca
	That's weird. The stairs down only led here.
Bianca
	Oh no! You dun't think we have to climb all the way back up to the top, do you?
Nera
	It looks like this is a dead end. I wonder if there's another way out.
Bianca
	Huh! I didn't expect to come all this way down only to have to climb all the way back up again!
Bianca
	There's all these huge holes all over the place.
	If only there was some way of knowin' which of them leads to the way out.
Nera
	I thought the path to Battenberg was difficult, but this is a whole new story.
Nera
	What enormous holes! Surely we're not going to have to jump down one of those too!?
Bianca
	Brilliant! Fancy you findin' this!
Nera
	You're truly amazing, being able to find something in a place like this!
Bianca
	We've come a long way up now. I wonder if we're on the right path.
Nera
	I wonder if everyone who travels to Gotha has to suffer this awful journey.
Bianca
	Wait a minute!
	See that peddler over there?
Bianca
	I wonder if we went and fell down the
	wrong hole...
Nera
	I'm sure I've seen that peddler before.
Nera
	Perhaps we took the wrong path. Or maybe we dropped down in the wrong spot. Either way, it looks like we'll have to try again.
Bianca
	Blimmin' marvellous! We finally cracked it!
Nera
	What a relief! This was starting to feel like an awfully long journey.
Nera
	I don't think my stomach knows where it is after all that dropping about all over the place.
Bianca
	Just when you think you're outside again, there's another cave! But the exit can't be far away now.
Nera
	Oh dear. Not inside the cave again! I'm sure the exit isn't far away now, though.
Bianca
	Do you think Sancho could be our Sancho?
	We have to find out! Come on, %a000090!
	Let's hurry to Gotha!
Nera
	Does the name Sancho mean something to you?
	It seemed to strike something of a chord...
Debora
	The journey should be much easier now we've crossed that flimsy bridge and we're on the
	downhill path.
Debora
	I don't think it's very good for the skin, all this trudging about in places like this.
Debora
	You will protect me if it comes to it, won't you, %a000090? I take care of you the rest of the time.
Debora
	It's all very well him saying it's too dangerous, but we don't have any choice but to keep going.
Debora
	Just keep going, %a000090. Have no fear!
	You lead the way, okay?
Debora
	Ouch! Why didn't that peddler warn us that that would happen?
Debora
	You'd have had to have serious words with him if I'd hurt one of my lovely feet, wouldn't you, %a000090?
Debora
	I do hope you're not just jumping about the place for the sheer fun of it.
Debora
	I'm sure I'd never have found myself having to fight off monsters in caves if I hadn't married you.
Debora
	Not that I regret it. No, I'm having a whale of a time.
Debora
	You know... I think I might be...
	Never mind. Let's keep going.
Debora
	Have you any idea where we are, %a000090?
Debora
	In fact, haven't you got that thing from Battenberg? You know, that thing that tells you the way.
Debora
	I don't take kindly to men who are slow on the uptake, so hurry up and figure out where we are.
Debora
	If you get discouraged, I'll always spur you along.
	Not that I know the way, mind you.
Debora
	Oh! How did you manage that?
	I always knew you were a scatterbrain.
Debora
	You weren't lying just then, were you?
	I don't forgive liars.
Debora
	I knew you were honest. You were true to your feelings and chose to marry me, after all.
	Do you think he really did find all those things?
Debora
	Are you lost? Never mind. At least your life's on the right track since you chose to marry me.
Debora
	I always thought Papa making me live on the top floor of the house was bad enough.
Debora
	But we've probably done the equivalent of the stairs up and down to my old room more than a hundred times here alone!
Debora
	Do you think we really have to jump down one of those holes? Go slowly, okay? If that's even possible.
Debora
	Not bad. It was quite clever of you to find this place along the way.
Debora
	We've climbed so far. This puts my moaning about all the stairs up to my old room into perspective.
Debora
	Well done. You've gone and brought us back to the same place.
Debora
	Still, I suppose it's not all bad. You quite enjoy flinging yourself down those holes, don't you?
Debora
	I feel all exhilarated. A bit like how you feel when you learn how to do something for the first time.
Debora
	Not more caves! I've had enough spelunking to last me a lifetime. Still, hopefully it's not too far.
Debora
	Do you know this Sancho man? I'm sure he'll be nice. Prince Harry was lovely too.
Debora
	In fact, everyone you know is nice.
	Is that by luck or design?
