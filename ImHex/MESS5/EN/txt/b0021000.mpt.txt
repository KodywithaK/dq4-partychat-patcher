	We must rescue Madalena before that happens,
	so that she may once again seal the gates.
*: 
	You are the one who must rescue her, %a000090. You, her son, have the power.
*: 
	This room was Madalena's.
*: 
	Something she used to say has remained firmly in my memory...
*: 
	She used to say that if light was in your heart, you could never be consumed by darkness.
*: 
	Here. I do not know if this will be of any use to you, but I am sure she would have liked you to have this book.
~ %0%a000120 receives an intricately embroidered book. ~
~ %0%a000180 acquires ⓗLofty Liltsⓘ. ~
*: 
	It is a book of psalms. We of Lofty Peak read from it from an early age. Good luck. May the Goddess protect you.
*: 
	My doors are open to you, weary %H0860%Xtraveller%Ytravellers%Z.
*: 
	Won't you rest here for the night, and recover from your weariness?
*: 
	Welcome to Lofty Peak.
*: 
	This is the home of the forgotten ones.
	Those who the world no longer knows.
*: 
	You have come to speak with the Elders?
	But the hour is already late.
*: 
	Would you not rest at the inn and return to speak with them in the morning?
*: 
	Night-time scares me now.
*: 
	If the gates of Nadiria are opened fully...
*: 
	...the world will darken in perpetual night!
~ It's locked from the inside. ~
~ Maybe it's because of the late hour. ~
~ %0%a000120 places %a020100 in the bag. ~
*: 
	There are many copies of the holy manuscript our priest here wrote to be found in churches all over the world.
*: 
	They're written in a special kind of ink, you see, so the writing in them doesn't fade, no matter how much time passes.
*: 
	I've been here for more years than I can remember now, trying to create more of the ink this church has so long been renowned for.
*: 
	I put the special ink mixture into the tusk of an eyevory tusk-tusk and left it to mature over several years.
*: 
	And finally! Finally, last night, it was ready!
*: 
	Oh! I want to share this joy with everyone
	I meet! Would you like to have some of the finished product?
*: 
	Then it's yours! Don't go wasting it,
	though, will you?
~ %0%a000120 receives a tusk-tusk tusk inkwell! ~

*: 
	N-No, you're quite right. I mustn't give it out to all and sundry, otherwise it'll be gone in the blink of an eye.
*: 
	The method of making tusk-tusk ink is a secret art known only to those in this area.
*: 
	I suppose you could call it a regional speciality of sorts.
*: 
	It was a fair while back now, but some soldiers came by here from the Kingdom of Gotha.
*: 
	They said something about being on a hunt for the missing king.
*: 
	I wonder if they found him. I do hope so.
*: 
	The best days for Gotha were when Pankraz was king.
*: 
	In all my years in this world, I don't think I've ever met a more solid character than him!
*: 
	This is the village of Battenberg.
	We have snow here all year round.
*: 
	It never used to be anywhere near as hard
	to get here in the past, before all the monsters came along.
*: 
	Haah... Haah... I bought myself an iron mask here, but it's just so heavy...
*: 
	Haah... Haah...
*: 
	Well, well! You're very young to have children!
*: 
	Naturally, my wife is beautiful and young-looking too, of course! Ha ha!
*: 
	Oh! Where are your mother and father?
*: 
	Children your age shouldn't be wandering about on their own. It's dangerous!
*: 
	When a woman's in love, she can stay young for all eternity.
*: 
	Shouldn't you be getting off home? Your mother and father are probably wondering where you are.
*: 
	This little boy will be the death of me.
	He won't eat a bite.
*: 
	And after all the effort I went to, making
	a soup to disguise the vegetables he says he hates so much!
*: 
	Come on now, eat up!
	It's good for you.
*: 
	It's not fair! Mum has some foods she doesn't like, so why can't I?
*: 
	Aaah. Oh? Hello. On your travels, are you?
*: 
	Ah, so you're trying to find your missing wife.
*: 
	Now, let me see. I'm sure I have a Batten binnacle here somewhere.
*: 
	Hopefully it'll come in handy on your journey.
	Take it, it's yours!
~ %0%a000120 receives a Batten binnacle! ~

	Make sure you treat her nicely once you've found her, won't you?
*: 
	Tsk, tsk, tsk!
*: 
	Fancy losing a precious Batten binnacle!
	I despair sometimes.
*: 
	Aaah. A Batten binnacle's indispensable if you're on your travels, that's for sure.
*: 
	Tsk, tsk, tsk!
*: 
	Meow.
*: 
	The people of Gotha were searching for their missing king for eight long years.
*: 
	He must be quite a man.
*: 
	Ooh! We don't often get visitors all the way up here. Enjoy your stay, won't you?
*: 
	Two generations of queens from Gotha have been kidnapped, you know.
*: 
	It's all very mysterious, it really is.
*: 
	Hey, man. Peace, and welcome to the Knot Welcome Inne! We've got some kinda offer-type thing goin' on right now.
*: 
	Hey, man. Peace, and welcome to the Knot Welcome Inne!
Granny Knot
	Yo, man. I'm Granny Knot and I suppose you could say I own this place here.
Granny Knot
	Y'know, people live among nature and then they return to the ground.
Granny Knot
	Every one of us only gets one chance at life, so you may as well make sure it's a gas. Have a cool journey now.
*: 
	We're havin' some kinda offer thing right
	now to encourage more folk to chill out and stay over.
*: 
	People who stay in groups of four get a special gift or somethin' hip like that.
*: 
	So if you're here as a group of four, lemme know, huh? Friendship rules!
*: 
	Huh? You already stayed here as a
	group of four?
*: 
	That's chillin', man! Then I guess I'd better give you my very own hand-made Forget-me-Knot flag.

*: 
	Maybe it'd be worth joinin' up if she

*: 
	Peace. Did you know that the main holy guy over at the Order of Zugzwang is actually a gal?
*: 
	You're kiddin'! You don't know about the Order? They're gonna save people who join up with them when the world ends, dude.
*: 
	I ain't buyin' it, though. Seems like all they do is collect up money, and I got better things to spend
	my twinklers on.
*: 
	I'm a travelling nun. Are you on your travels too?
*: 
	There's a terrible sinister aura coming from far across the ocean to the west of late.
*: 
	Do be careful if you're heading that way.
*: 
	Ooh! It's all too goosome for words! I keep having dreams about the past.
*: 
	Monsters made me attack goomans. I mean, humans. But they did nothing to deserve it!

	Ooh, it's not often we have any

*: 
	While you're here, I might as well give you
	a couple of pointers.
*: 
	Apparently, there used to be a tower on Azimuthias, the continent north of here,
	that reached right up to the heavens.
*: 
	I wonder if it's still there now.
*: 
	What do you want? Come for a gander at me desert rose collection, have ya?
*: 
	They're stonkin', except the old man at the

*: 
	Silly old me just climbed aboard that thing without so much as a should-I-diddly-shouldn't-I.
	And that was twenty years ago!
*: 
	I should've known better. Curiosity killed the cat.
	Every good citizen knows that wholesome adage, don't they?
*: 
	Oh, dearie! I'm forgetting my manners.
	I haven't even introduced myself.
	They call me Dr Agon.
Dr Agon
	You'll probably find this a bit hard to believe, but I'm actually a Zenithian, you know. Oh, yes indeedy.
Dr Agon
	And if twenty years on that cart hasn't spoilt
	the old Agon intuition, I'd say that's where
	you're headed.
Dr Agon
	Nothing like a good old fashioned, blister-rubbing trip, is there? Mind if I come along with you, %H0860%Xfriend%Yfriends%Z?
Dr Agon
	%H0860%XYou%YYou all%Z know the other age-old adage.
	There's safety in num-diddly-umbers!
~ The Zenithian Dr Agon joins the party. ~
Dr Agon
	I'm ready for action!
	Let's hit the road!
*: 
	No one knows what this place was. A shrine built by Nimzo to get at the Goddess, perhaps...
*: 
	Or a holy place created by the Goddess to guide the righteous...
*: 
	Plenty of archaeologists have put people like me to work over the years excavating the place in the hope of finding out.
*: 
	But it's still a mystery.
*: 
	Or perhaps people were just too scared to find out the truth.
~ There are some points here. ~
~ Switch them over? ~
Dr Agon
	Well, shoot! Would you look at that? Now the castle's at the bottom of this lake, practically every room's flooded. The whole shebang!
Dr Agon
	I've been scratching my noggin now for a month of Sun-diddly-undays, but I still can't figure out why the place fell out of the sky.
Dr Agon
	Just as I thought, there isn't a Zen-diddly-ithian in the whole place.
Dr Agon
	Oh, bless my cotton socks, I almost forgot!
	There should be a secret staircase just behind
	the old throne here...
Dr Agon
	What in the name of hi-diddly-ho!?
Dr Agon
	There should be a gold orb on this pedestal, but it's as empty as a heart full of sin!
Dr Agon
	And this hole...
Dr Agon
	I suppose it must've opened up when that evil knievel one awoke long, long ago.
Dr Agon
	Of all the rotten luck! The gold orb must've fallen out through it!
Dr Agon
	I guess with only one orb left, the poor castle
	just couldn't...
Dr Agon
	Well, now we know why Zenithia crashed out of the sky at least.
Dr Agon
	I just wish to goodness I knew where the
	gold orb was.
Dr Agon
	The pedestal's still got a bit of the old gold orb aura about it, though.
Dr Agon
	Maybe with a spot of meditation, I could figure out where in the world the orb ended up.
~ Dr Agon closes his eyes and starts to gather ~
~ his thoughts... ~
Bianca
	Well, that's good. Now the two of them can finally sleep peacefully together.
Bianca
	Those ghosts who took over this place were a nasty bunch, eh?
Bianca
	But it's the monsters who came along and killed all those poor innocent people who are the most to blame.
Bianca
	Oh! What's that? What a pretty ball!
Bianca
	I'll bet it's some kind of reward.
	We should take it with us.

Prince Harry
	I'm the Prince of Coburg. The next in line to the throne! I expect you want to serve me by being
	my lackey, do you?
Dr Agon
	Holy Goddess, we're done-diddly-doodahed for!
	The orb's been destroyed!
Dr Agon
	Zenithia won't ever fly above the clouds agⓚⓛ
Dr Agon
	No! Wait a mo-diddly-oment!
	This ship isn't sinking that easily!
Dr Agon
	If my old noggin's not failing me, I seem to remember a legend about the faeries creating the two orbs.
Dr Agon
	Maybe we could ask the Faerie Queen to work her honeydew magic again and cook us up another one.
Dr Agon
	You know, I've heard there's a forest somewhere in the world that leads to the Realm of the Faeries.
Dr Agon
	Hi-diddly-ho, it's a plan, %a000140! I'll be waiting here. You run along and see what you can do, okay?
~ %0%a000120 examines the pedestal... ~

	Welcome to Coburg.

	You've probably heard all about me. I'm the one who helped Prince Harry oust that fake dowager.
*: 
	What!? The one who did it was actually the
	Prince of Gotha?
*: 
	He went missing at just about the time he was crowned, didn't he?

*: 
	But that don't mean you're gettin' the treasure
	I nabbed!
*: 
	Huh! I'll get you for this one o' these days!
*: 
	Rumour has it that there's an incredible
	treasure hidden in a cave surrounded by
	mountains far to the west.
*: 
	It's supposed to be something really special, but the surroundings are crawling with monsters.
*: 
	I'd keep away from the place if I were you.
*: 
	This is Coburg Castle.
*: 
	Wait a minute! You're that friend of Prince Harry's! It's %a000090, isn't it?
*: 
	Go on through!
*: 
	I'm finding it nigh on impossible to relax at
	the moment.
*: 
	I can't shake this feeling that a huge and
	powerful evil force has begun to strengthen
	its grip on our world.
*: 
	Prince Harry is at the end of his tether with all of little Prince Kendrick's antics.
*: 
	I'm in love with Prince Kendrick!
*: 
	He's really nice.
*: 
	Aaaaaaaah!
*: 
	You gave me a bit of a fright there. I thought it was Prince Kendrick, you see.
*: 
	His latest trick is putting mice on people's heads because he knows everyone hates them. Not very nice at all.
*: 
	These are Darwin the Psarologist's quarters.
Darwin
	My research tells me that somewhere in the world there still exists a cape that was worn long ago by
	a brave king in battle.
Darwin
	When a special person uses special armour like that, it enables them to achieve their true potential.
Darwin
	I heard the news about you becoming King of Gotha, %a000090.
Darwin
	I'm sure you'd have what it takes to make good use of the cape if you could find it.
*: 
	Ouch! I knew I'd end up with a bump on my
	head. Prince Kendrick will be the death of me
	one of these days.
*: 
	King Wilbur has vowed not to get married. That way, he hopes to prevent another power struggle like the last one.
*: 
	I suppose that means that the next King of Coburg will be Prince Harry's young lad, Kendrick.
*: 
	Ah-phew, ah-phew.
*: 
	Welcome to Coburg, ruled over by
	His Majesty King Wilbur!
King Wilbur
	Oh! It's you!
King Wilbur

	Or should I say King %a000090?
King Wilbur
	I was terribly worried when I heard you'd disappeared, King %a000090.
King Wilbur
	It was such a relief to hear you'd returned to Gotha safe and sound.
King Wilbur
	I hoped you'd be paying a visit here in Coburg again before long.
King Wilbur
	Do make yourself at home, won't you?

*: 
	Hey! Who are you?
Harry
	Kendrick! You mustn't address guests like that!

Harry
	I do beg your pardon. I'm afraid my son's manners are a bit lacⓚⓛ Oh!
Harry
	Good heavens! It's you, %a000090!
	I've been hoping you'd pay a visit.
Harry
	I can't tell you how thrilled we were to hear you'd turned up in Gotha in one piece.
Harry
	You did have a rotten bit of luck there, eh?
Harry
	In fact, you've always seemed to be a bit jinxed, come to think of it.
Harry
	Still, it's great to see you here again safe and well.
Harry
	Oh yes! I'm a father now, by the way.
Harry
	This is my son, Kendrick.
