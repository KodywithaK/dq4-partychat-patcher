*: 
	I'm Monty, the famous monster monitor.
Monty
	I take care of folks' monsters for them.
	What can I do for you today?
Monty
	Sorry, %A0110%Xmister%Z%B0110%Xlady%Z, but the monstergarten is full to bursting at the moment.
Monty
	I'm afraid you'll have to part ways with someone to free up some space if you want to give me any new little ones to look after.
Monty
	Come on now, %A0110%Xmister%Z%B0110%Xlady%Z! I hardly think you need me to look after you.
Monty
	Which monster would you like me to look after?
Monty
	Come on now, %A0110%Xmister%Z%B0110%Xlady%Z! I hardly think you need me to look after you.
Monty
	I don't know how happy %a000180 would be about that.
Monty
	Besides, I only take care of monsters here.
Monty
	But if I took you in, who would that leave to look after the wagon?
Monty
	You're not planning on giving me someone in a coffin to look after, surely!? That seems a bit rough.
Monty
	I suppose you're going to tell me you can't afford to pay for a resurrection at the moment, right?
Monty
	Well, then I suppose there's nothing for it.
	Consider %a000180's coffin duly in my care.
Monty
	In that case, I suggest you bring %a000180 back to life first. It's only polite, after all.
Monty
	You'd like me to look after %a000180?
	Very well.
Monty
	I'll put any items that aren't equipped into your bag there for you, okay?
Monty
	Some folk have a tendency to forget who has what otherwise, you see.
Monty
	Would you like me to take care of anyone else for you today?
Monty
	I don't think it'd be very clever to make your party any bigger than it already is.
Monty
	Why don't you check someone else in here with me first?
Monty
	There must be some sort of misunderstanding. I don't have any of your monsters in the monstergarten at the moment.
Monty
	Who've you come to collect?
Monty
	Hey, %a000180! It's home time!
~ %0%a000180 joins the party. ~
~ %0%a000180 gets into the wagon. ~
Monty
	Will you be taking anyone else with you today?
Monty
	There must be some sort of misunderstanding. I don't have any of your monsters in the monstergarten at the moment.
Monty
	Who would you like to check up on first?
Monty
	Do you want to check up on anyone else?
Monty
	There must be some sort of misunderstanding. I don't have any of your monsters in the monstergarten at the moment.
Monty
	If there's a monster you'd like to part ways with, you need to check them in with me first.
Monty
	So you've decided it's time to permanently part ways with one of your monsters?
Monty
	It's sad, that's for sure, but I can't go on looking after these little guys forever.
Monty
	Time to wipe away the tears and decide who it's to be. Who would you like to say goodbye to?
Monty
	I do hope you're joking!
	%0%a001210 would be devastated!
Monty
	I'm sure %a000180 will go back to live happily in the wild.
Monty
	I see. Then it falls to me to give %a000180 a respectful burial.
Monty
	You know this means you'll never see %a000180 again, don't you? Are you sure you're okay with that?
Monty
	Very well. Then we'll set %a000180 free.
~ %0%a000180 returns happily to the wild. ~
Monty
	Much-loved %a000180, may the Goddess grant you eternal peace.
~ %0%a000180's spirit rises up into the heavens. ~
Monty
	Ah, you'd like to change someone's name, would you? Who's it to be?
Monty
	Oh dear! It seems that %a000180 has incurred the wrath of the naming god. There'll be no name-changing going on here!
Monty
	Unless you want to pay 5000 gold coins to appease the almighty one, of course...
Monty
	What do you say?
Monty
	Ah, it looks like that's a bit beyond your means. You'll just have to put up with the name as it is for now, I'm afraid.
~ %0%a000090 pays 5000 gold coins. ~
Monty
	Okay, now you can tell me what you'd like to change %a000180's name to.
Monty
	No problem, then. We'll leave it as it is.
Monty
	%0%a000180? Okay.
	What name do you have in mind?
Monty
	You want to give your bag a name?
	You're sharp, aren't you? I can tell that.
Monty
	Hah hah. Yes, the bag is practically a living, breathing member of the party, after all. It's a nice idea to give it a name.
Monty
	So, what are you going to call it then?
Monty
	Changed your mind, have you?
	Fair enough. It's your decision!
Monty
	Hmm... I don't think that's really going to work. It might be better to think up something else.
Monty
	Okay, %a001270 it is... Wait a minute! There's already someone in your party with the exact same name.
~ %0%a001270!? Don't you think that might be a little bit tricky to pronounce? ~
Monty
	%0%a001270!? Are you trying to make fun of the whole naming business, %A0110%Xmister%Z%B0110%Xlady%Z?
Monty
	You're not making fun, and that's the name you genuinely want to use?
Monty
	Then let's try to come up with something else. What's %a000180's new name to be?
Monty
	So you want to change %a000180's name to %a001270? Are you sure about that?
Monty
	Then so be it! Henceforth, may %a000180 be known as %a001270!
Monty
	Well, don't come crying to me if you incur the wrath of the naming god! Are you sure you want to risk it?
Monty
	Then so be it! Henceforth, may %a000180 be known as %a001270! ...Yikes!
Monty
	Look! I warned you this might happen! You've only gone and angered the naming god!
Monty
	Now %a000180 will be stuck with the name %a001270 for evermore!
Monty
	Why don't you try a different name?
Monty
	Do you want to do any more renaming today?
Monty
	Changed your mind, have you? Okay!
Monty
	Can I do anything else for you today?
Monty
	Remember, I'm here to help whenever you need me. You take care out there, won't you?
Monty
	Ah, you want to see how your monsters are getting on, do you?
~ %0%a000180's coffin is carried off and loaded into the wagon. ~
