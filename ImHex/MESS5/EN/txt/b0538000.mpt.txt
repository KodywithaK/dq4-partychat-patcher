	Glug... Glug... Hang on! I can breathe! I was sure
	I wouldn't be able to, what with being underwater and all.
%0%a001250
	Look! Did you see that huge fish just swim past?
Tuppence
	This looks rather a tricky place to defend.
	Aaah! I suppose that's why they had it floating
	up in the sky.
Dr Agon
	It's, it's enough to make an old fella cry, I, I... (sob)
	Ah ha ha! Just joshin' with ya!
	I'm not really blubbing!
Dr Agon
	So the old castle's as waterlogged as a log full of water, eh? It's gonna be fun, fun, fun drying the place out. Away with you mould! Away!
%0%a001240
	Is this Zenithia, the castle in the sky?
	It's a bit different to how I expected.
%0%a001250
	Is it just around the castle that there's air?
	It's a lot brighter than you'd expect for
	somewhere that's underwater.
Sancho
	But ees good ees een the lake, no?
Sancho
	Eef ees falling on the land or on a town, maybe ees a beeg problem, sí?
Dr Agon
	What's that? Was this castle airborne twenty years ago? I can't tell you, friend.
Dr Agon
	Let me see... How many decades ago did I leave now? Oooh... I guess I wasn't counting!
%0%a001240
	I can't help feeling a bit down in the dumps here. It's sad to see something that was once so grand in such a state.
%0%a001250
	I could be wrong, but it feels like things have brightened up a little bit here. Maybe it's because
	we came along.
Sancho
	When I esee thees kind of place, eso deserted and een the ruins, I can no help but theenk of Whealbrook. Ees, ees very painful.
Tuppence
	I wonder where all the Zenithian ladies are hiding themselves. Er, and the men as well, of course.
Dr Agon
	It's not Zenithia now, eh?
	It's Beneathia! Hah hah hah haⓚⓛ
	Oh, you didn't like that one?
Dr Agon
	I'm more of a breaststroke man than a crawler, myself. The crawl's so gosh-darned hard.
Dr Agon
	Shame I don't have my aqua jammies with me. I could've shown you my moves!
%0%a001240
	I've always hated tidying my room, but I'm going to make sure I do it from now on.
%0%a001240
	Castles look much better when they're kept all nice.
Sancho
	You really believe thees castle, eet was once floating een the air? I no eso esure...
Tuppence
	I can't help worrying that my weapons and
	armour will rust away to nothing with all this
	water about.
Dr Agon
	You know, I think I'm starting to like this
	underwater look!
Dr Agon
	But you should have seen the place before.
	The beautiful garden, the great throne room...
	It was to die-diddly-eye for!
Dr Agon
	It's a bit damp, but it's still the same old castle.
	No monsters around here!
%0%a001240
	A secret staircase? I'll find it, Dad!
	Don't you go finding it first, okay?
%0%a001250
	Do you think it's alright for him to tell us a secret like that?
Tuppence
	You'd better count me out. I was never any good at finding things. I never liked it.
	Over to you, %a000090...
%0%a001240
	We did it, Dad! We found the stairs!
Dr Agon
	%0%a000090! You're right-diddly-ight on the ball, my friend!
Dr Agon
	I really didn't think you'd find the hidden staircase!
%0%a001240
	I wonder how far down this goes.
	It's pitch-black down there.
%0%a001250
	I'm okay. As long as I don't look down, I'm okay.
Sancho
	Qué? A heedden estaircase?
	What you theenk ees at the bottom?
%0%a001240
	There's a weird kind of glowing. I wonder what it is. I feel like I've seen it somewhere before.
%0%a001250
	This room's different from all the others.
	It has an air of magic to it.
Dr Agon
	Oh... Why don't you go a bit further, %a000090?
%0%a001240
	A gold orb? Do you know what he's on about, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Dr Agon gave me a fright there, shouting out like that! What do you suppose it is he's looking at?
Sancho
	Qué? What ees the matter weeth señor Agon?
	We should find out, friend.
Tuppence
	I'm afraid I'm finding his witterings rather tricky to follow. Fancy there being a hole in the castle, though!
%0%a001240
	What was that? I saw it...
	Was that boy... Was it you, Dad?
%0%a001240
	This is making my head hurt!
	Did all that really happen?
%0%a001250
	Are you okay, Dad?
	You look a bit pale.
%0%a001250
	Um... Don't cry or anything, will you?
	We're here for you, you know.
Sancho
	Eso thees ees how señor Pankraz, he, he...
Sancho
	............
Tuppence
	What a monster! How despicable!
Tuppence
	I don't know if faeries really exist, but we must at least go and find out!
%0%a001240
	So if we find the gold orb, the castle will float up in the sky again?
%0%a001240
	But how are we supposed to find the faerie village?
%0%a001240
	I wonder if Dr Agon's a bit lonely all by himself
	in the castle.
%0%a001240
	So the faeries made the castle float?
	That's so cool!
%0%a001250
	Are we going to meet some faeries?
	Yay! I can't wait!
%0%a001250
	I hope we get to meet some faeries soon. Ooh! You met some when you were little, Dad? You're so lucky!
Sancho
	Perdón. I no can theenk of anytheeng now.
Sancho
	We go to esomeone to make us the gold orb, sí?
	Ees okay. I know.
Tuppence
	The Faerie Queen... Zenithians...
	It all sounds like the stuff of legend! How thrilling!
Tuppence
	I'm intrigued to know what this Faerie Queen is like.
	I can't wait to meet her.
