%0%a001240
	You named me, didn't you, Dad?
%0%a001240
	I love the name %a001240.
	It's so cool. Thanks!
%0%a001240
	Wow! Where did you get that map, Dad?
	It's the most amazing map I've ever seen!
%0%a001240
	If we'd had that, we probably could've saved you a bit sooner.
%0%a001240
	Sancho says I look just like you when you were younger. Do you think so too?
%0%a001250
	I always wanted to go on an adventure with you, Dad. This is like a dream come true!
%0%a001250
	What do you think of my outfit, Dad?
	Cousin Gertie picked it out for me.
Sancho
	I, I estill no believe ees really you, friend!
	And travelling together again like thees...
	I, I eso happy!
Sancho
	You no worry about your leettle ones.
Sancho
	When you are growing up, friend, I learn muchos about raising the bebés.
Sancho
	I, I thank you for taking me weeth you on your quest thees time. Your Uncle Sancho, he gonna earn hees garbanzos.
Sancho
	Ees eso easy travelling now you are
	weeth us, friend.
Sancho
	When your eson ees more esmall, he and hees esister, always they are getting away from me.
Tuppence
	Y-Yes!? Wh-What can I do for you, Your Majesty?
Tuppence
	Sorry... I-I'm a bit nervous!
	I mean, I'm travelling with the King!
Tuppence
	You're quite a bit younger than I expected, Your Majesty. In fact, you look about the same age as me.
Tuppence
	I'm probably not really up to the task, but I'd lay my life on the line to protect you, Your Majesty.
	Have no fear!
%0%a001240
	Can we use the flying carpet more, Dad?
	Please! I love that floating feeling you get on it.
%0%a001240
	I was just thinking about Lofty Peak. I'd like to go back there sometime. I mean, that's where Grandma was born, isn't it?
%0%a001240
	Travelling with you is great, Dad. If Mum was with us now too, it'd be the best trip ever!
%0%a001250
	You walk really fast, Dad.
	Is it because you've got long legs?
%0%a001250
	Being on the flying carpet's a bit like being a bird.
	It's a funny feeling.
%0%a001250
	I love monsters. I really hate having to fight them
	all the time.
Sancho
	You have become estrong, like the true
	macho man, eh, friend? You have
	gone through eso much...
Sancho
	We have been esearching for the clues to find señora %a001230 too. But we find notheeng. Nada!
Sancho
	Hahh...hahh... Maybe ees my years, but ⓚⓛ hahh ⓚⓛ
	I ees tired eso quickly these days.
	You no wanna use the flying carpet?
Tuppence
	All I ever knew of the world was Gotha and places nearby. I never thought I'd get the chance to travel the world!
Tuppence
	I thought carpets that flew only existed in faerie tales. It's incredible!
%0%a001240
	I'm going to become big and strong so that no one can ever hurt you or %a001250 again, Dad!
%0%a001240
	Travelling so much makes places that seemed far away feel much closer.
%0%a001240
	I mean, using the flying carpet or Zoom, nowhere's very far away, is it?
%0%a001250
	Can I walk next to you again today, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Cousin Gertie said that if you walk too much, you get fat ankles.
%0%a001250
	Are my ankles fat?
	Or are they normal?
Sancho
	When I esee you from behind, friend, you look
	just like your father. You are estrong like heem now.
Sancho
	Thees magma estaff, I hear eet has the esame power like the eruption of the volcano!
Sancho
	Eef you know how you are using eet, you can destroy entire mountains even.
	Ees escary, no?
Tuppence
	All this travelling and battle experience surely means promotion for me when I get back to Gotha.
Tuppence
	Ah ha ha!
	It's a tough old life!
Tuppence
	I bet you've got a few girlfriends hidden away in some of these towns and villages, eh?
	Er! I mean... Sorry, Your Majesty!
Tuppence
	Travelling's all about helping each other out, and encouraging each other really, isn't it?
	I think of you as a true friend now, %a000090.
%0%a001240
	Huh? Where did Dr Agon go?
	He just disappeared.
%0%a001240
	I thought everyone from Zenithia was supposed to be really cool. Looks like there are always exceptions, though.
%0%a001240
	I've been thinking about this Zenithia castle thing... Castles are really big and heavy, aren't they?
%0%a001240
	So isn't it obvious that it would fall out of the sky?
%0%a001240
	Shouldn't we look for Dr Agon, Dad?
	Maybe he's lost.
%0%a001250
	There's something a bit scary about Dr Agon.
	Don't you think so, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Maybe Dr Agon's waiting for us in that Diggery Pokery place with all the mine carts...
Sancho
	Ees fun travelling weeth eso many people, eh, friend? Qué? Where ees señor Agon?
Sancho
	Ees become complicated, sí, friend?
	Zenithia, thees estairway, thees castle...
	Ees eso much to theenk about.
Sancho
	Thees poor señor Agon, he ees all alone for
	twenty years!
Sancho
	Eet, eet must be eso hard for heem!
	(sob)
Tuppence
	He's a bit of a mystery, that Dr Agon fellow, isn't he? He just disappeared once we got out of the cave.
Tuppence
	Zenithia, eh? Sounds like the sort of place that would be full of beautiful young maidens!
%0%a001240
	I wonder what sort of place the faeries live in.
	Do you know, Dad?
%0%a001240
	What? In the cellar in your house before?
	No way! I'm not falling for that!
%0%a001240
	Faeries in story books have wings. And they always like playing tricks on people too.
%0%a001240
	I wonder if they're really like that...
%0%a001250
	Gotha Castle's not going to sink to the bottom of a lake too, is it?
%0%a001250
	Are we going to meet faeries?
	I'd love it if we really did!
%0%a001250
	Actually, wasn't there a nun at the abbey who was talking about faeries?
Sancho
	Your Uncle Sancho, he no believe een thees
	Realm of the Faeries. Ees a joke, sí?
	Ees no eserious.
Sancho
	I no theenk ees gonna happen, but we try to find thees Fearie Lea place, sí?
Tuppence
	Faeries, eh? I bet they're pretty little things.
Tuppence
	My mother always used to say that faeries live
	in places where the air is clear and there aren't many people.
%0%a001240
	Dad! Will you let me blow the faerie horn later?
%0%a001240
	You made friends with a faerie once, didn't you, Dad? I wonder if I'll make any faerie friends...
%0%a001240
	Can we go and play in Faerie Lea as often as we want? Can we, Dad? Can we?
%0%a001250
	The faerie horn's so pretty. Do you think if I became a faerie, I could make things like that too?
%0%a001250
	We're looking for the Faerie Palace, aren't we?
	Where's a lake that's surrounded by mountains,
	I wonder.
Sancho
	I no believe eet, but these faeries,
	they are real!
Sancho
	Now when I am theenking back, I remember you are eso often playing een the cellar. And I theenk you are on your own!
Sancho
	Eef only you esay to me then, friend, your Uncle Sancho, he come weeth you!
Tuppence
	Aren't faeries just wonderful?
	I think they're amazing.
Tuppence
	It's rather lazy just settling for a mate from the place you grew up in.
Tuppence
	No, you've got to travel the world and find a beautiful, young ⓚⓛ and kind, of course ⓚⓛ woman to fall in love with. That's the romantic way.
Tuppence
	How do I look from this angle?
	I strike a pose like this...and smile like this...
	Well? I think I look irresistible!
%0%a001240
	Why isn't this gold bauble any good?
	It's really shiny!
%0%a001240
	Oh, no. The Faerie Queen can't make a
	gold orb for us.
%0%a001240
	Dr Agon will be really upset.
	What are we going to do, Dad?
%0%a001240
	Changing the course of time?
	What does that mean?
%0%a001240
	You can't change what's already
	happened...can you?
%0%a001250
	I know you'll find a way out of this, Dad. Just when it looks impossible, you'll think of something.
	You always do.
%0%a001250
	If only we could just turn this gold bauble into a gold orb... But I suppose that's impossible, isn't it?
%0%a001250
	Okay... I'm thinking...
	There's got to be a way somehow...
Sancho
	You know how many times your Uncle Sancho, he weeshes he can change the past?
	Sí... Many, many times...
Sancho
	Ees looking the esame, but thees gold bauble, ees no use, eh?
Tuppence
	Maybe we should try asking Queen Caramel again?
Tuppence
	I mean, there are plenty of people who make a big song and dance about things and say they can't do something at first when really they can.
Tuppence
	If you need some time to mull things over, %a000090, at least let's mull them over in the presence of the pretty little faeries of Faerie Lea.
%0%a001240
	Dad... Where did this gold orb suddenly appear from? I don't get it.
%0%a001240
	Do you think this will really make Zenithia fly back up to the sky?
%0%a001250
	You look a bit sad, Dad.
%0%a001250
	Here. I'll let you hold my hand.
Sancho
	Thees esmall orb, you believe eet really has the power to make the castle fly?
Sancho
	Friend... Are you alright?
Sancho
	No. I esorry. You no have to esay notheeng to me eef you no want to.
Sancho
	Ees good, sí?
	Señor Agon, he be eso happy!
Tuppence
	Is something on your mind, %a000090,
	Your Majesty?
Tuppence
	I'm only asking in case it was distracting you from looking where you were going. I wouldn't want you to trip up.
Tuppence
	It's back to Zenithia then, I suppose?
	Let's go!
%0%a001240
	Why are we still walking around?
	We could fly anywhere now in the Zenithian castle!
%0%a001240
	Come on, Dad! Let's go!
	I'll be the pilot!
%0%a001240
	Dr Agon's a really weird man, isn't he?
%0%a001240
	Where do we go now, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I'm not scared of flying in the Zenithian castle.
	You can't see outside, so it's fine.
%0%a001250
	And it means there's no need to use the flying carpet any more, doesn't it?
%0%a001250
	Will you tell me a story about Mum before I go to sleep tonight, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Oh, Mum...
	Where are you?
Sancho
	Qué? We estill walking even when we have thees castle to ride eenside?
Sancho
	Ha ha ha! Ees a joke, sí?
	Very funny, friend!
Sancho
	Ees no Zenithia unless eet ees up een the esky, no?
Sancho
	Ees like the paella weeth no eseafood.
Tuppence
	Those Zenithians must be a hardy lot living underwater for so many years, eh?
Tuppence
	I bet they could teach me a trick or two.
Tuppence
	Well, %a000090? Where to next?
	Just lead the way, and I'll follow.
%0%a001240
	Where can Mum be? Is there anywhere we haven't looked yet?
%0%a001240
	Who are we supposed to give this dragon orb to, though? Shall we take it to Zenithia?
%0%a001250
	There's something really funny about that dragon orb. If you look at it for too long, you feel like it's going to swallow you up.
%0%a001250
	Do you think the power of the Zenith Dragon is inside the dragon orb?
%0%a001250
	I wonder where the Zenith Dragon is...
Sancho
	We are close now, no?
	Esoon, we have the chance to avenge señor Pankraz's death.
Sancho
	Sí...
	The bad guys, they are close...
Sancho
	Ees no eso far away now. Your Uncle Sancho, he feels you gonna meet %a001230 again esoon, friend.
Tuppence
	How long's it been now since we went back to Gotha? It feels like ages.
Tuppence
	What? It's not? Oh, sorry. I hope I didn't sound like a little sissy who wants to go home!
Tuppence
	That tower of stairs isn't the only way to get to Zenithia. We should look for another route.
Tuppence
	Travelling can be a bit scary at times, can't it?
	I mean, you don't even know if you're going the right way sometimes.
%0%a001240
	I still can't believe it.
	I don't know what to say!
%0%a001240
	Dr Agon was the Zenith Dragon all along, and we had no idea!
%0%a001240
	So all we have to do is ring the Zenithian Tintinnabulum, and Dr Agon will come?
%0%a001240
	I half expect him to come in a mine cart!
	That'd make everyone laugh.
%0%a001240
	I bet the Zenith Dragon doesn't think anything about being high up. I mean, he flies right up above the clouds, doesn't he?
%0%a001250
	I've been having this dream recently. I see Mum.
	She's up really high, and she looks really sad.
%0%a001250
	Are we going somewhere high up next, then?
	I'll try not to get too scared.
%0%a001250
	I hope we find you soon, Mum...
Sancho
	Now the Zenith Dragon, he ees our amigo, we have the estrength of one hundred burros!
Sancho
	Come, friend. We no need to be escared of
	anytheeng now!
Sancho
	I feel eso proud to be by your eside, friend!
Sancho
	Gracias, frⓚⓛ
	No, I mean gracias, My Majesty.
	I no let you down.
Tuppence
	Just when you think you know someone!
	I can't believe Dr Agon's really the Zenith Dragon.
Tuppence
	I mean, I'd have tried to butter him up a bit more if I'd known.
Tuppence
	So then... Where to next?
Tuppence
	Wherever it is, we should get the Zenith Dragon to take us there. It's not every day you get to be given a lift by a dragon, is it?
Bianca
	It's funny bein' back together again like this, eh?
Bianca
	I always believed the day would come sooner or later, though.
Bianca
	Come on, %a000090.
	Your mum's waitin' for us in Nadiria.
Bianca
	The problem is knowin' how to get to Nadiria in the first place, eh?
Bianca
	You got any ideas up your sleeve, %a000090?
Nera
	Our children have grown up so much...
	I'm so glad to be with them now, but so sad about all the time I've missed.
Nera
	I was out of their lives for such a long time...
Nera
	Let's get the job done now, darling.
	Let's go to Nadiria and get this Grandmaster of the Underworld out of the way, shall we?
Nera
	I want to sit down with Sancho and hear all about our children and how they were as they were growing up.
Nera
	It's so wonderful to be able to walk side by side like this again.
Nera
	But I know there are things to be done before we can relax and enjoy our time together.
%0%a001240
	Mum's... She seems much kinder than I'd imagined.
%0%a001240
	I'm really lucky to have parents like you.
%0%a001240
	What's this Nadiria place like, Dad?
%0%a001240
	What? No! I'm not scared!
	I just want to know what kind of monsters I'm going to have to protect you from, that's all.
%0%a001240
	So we're finally going to Nadiria, after all
	this travelling. We'll finally get to meet this Grandmaster Nimzo.
%0%a001250
	I'm tougher than I used to be, aren't I?
	I don't get in your way any more, do I?
	...Do I?
%0%a001250
	Look! Mum put this ribbon in my hair for me.
%0%a001250
	My head's so happy, it can't stop smiling!
	Hee hee hee!
%0%a001250
	Now that we've found Mum, it makes me want to find Grandma even more.
%0%a001250
	You don't think I'm being greedy, do you, Dad?
	You want to find Grandma too, don't you?
Sancho
	Eef we find your mother, friend, and we breeng her back to Gotha esafely...
Sancho
	Then your dear father, señor Pankraz, he be eso happy at last!
Sancho
	I know you are no a bebé no more, friend, but anyway I esay eet...
Sancho
	Have you prepared properly for your
	journey? You have the medicinal herbs
	and the chimaera wings?
Sancho
	You are a great man, friend. Even now you are the king, you no change, eh?
Sancho
	Eef I am you, friend, I know I am wanting to go and find señora Mada.
Tuppence
	I know it's probably not my place to say anything, but I think I speak for all Gothans about this.
Tuppence
	We support you, Your Majesty, in your quest to storm Nadiria!
Tuppence
	I, I don't know what to say...
	I'm delighted that you'd choose me to accompany you on this daring mission to save Queen Mada!
Tuppence
	You're planning on setting off for Nadiria right now? Ah ha ha ha! Wouldn't that be a bit odd?
Bianca
	The entrance to Nadiria is open now. Looks like it's time to go through.
Bianca
	Who'd have thought that one of the keys to enterin' Nadiria would be my weddin' ring?
Bianca
	I feel like it must be fate or somethin'.
Bianca
	If we're ready to go, then we'd better get a move on. There's no time to lose.
Nera
	Are you ready to go to Nadiria then, darling?
Nera
	Everything looks more or less the same as before I was turned to stone, but the situation's much more serious now, isn't it?
Nera
	Isn't it amazing? Two of the rings we need to
	open the gateway to Nadiria are our very own wedding rings!
Nera
	You see, it was destiny that we should be together, right from the start.
%0%a001240
	I think I prefer our world to the underworld.
%0%a001240
	But you're going back to Nadiria, aren't you, Dad?
	And I'm coming with you!
%0%a001240
	Putting the three rings on the statue really worked, just like the people in Lofty Peak said.
%0%a001250
	I'm not scared as long as I'm with you and Mum and %a001240.
%0%a001250
	Do you think all the good monsters will vanish if we manage to defeat the Grandmaster of Nadiria?
%0%a001250
	Uh-hu-hurgh... It's scary thinking that the Grandmaster of Nadiria's power is seeping
	into our world too.
Sancho
	You no leave your Uncle Sancho behind at thees, the last hour!
Sancho
	I must esee the end of thees now, or I no die
	happy.
Sancho
	I never feel the power like thees before, even when I am travelling weeth señor Pankraz.
Sancho
	My Majesty! Your Uncle Sancho, he ees ready to fight! I feel like I am the young man again!
Sancho
	To Nadiria!
	We must beat the hot iron now!
Tuppence
	Back to Nadiria, is it, %a000090?
Tuppence
	You've made a wise choice picking me to come with you, Your Majesty!
Tuppence
	I'm the only regular Gothan who gets to go to the underworld, aren't I? What a lucky chap I am!
Debora
	I always had faith that you'd come and rescue me, %a000090.
Debora
	I trained you well as my servant, so I had faith. Teaching people is one of my many fortes, you know. I'm something of a mentor.
Debora
	I couldn't believe it when I saw how big the babies have grown. It makes me feel so sad.
Debora
	I wish I could've been there to see them grow up.
	The only saving grace of the situation is that I'm still as young as I was all those years ago.
Debora
	We have to do all we can to go to Nadiria and rescue your mother, %a000090.
Debora
	Then I'll be able to make those fiends pay for what they did to me.
Debora
	The entrance to Nadiria is open.
	It's time to go, %a000090.
Debora
	I never believed in luck until now.
Debora
	But two of the rings that open the path to Nadiria are our wedding rings!
Debora
	It seems a little too much of a coincidence to me.
	You were obviously destined to become my servant.
Debora
	If the preparations are done, then we should get going. Time waits for no man.
