Bianca
	I didn't expect to find a cave in a place like this.
Bianca
	I dun't much like the look of this place. We'd better watch where we're walkin', %a000090.
Nera
	Do be careful, darling. I can't help feeling some very sinister vibes here in this cave.
Nera
	The path here is so treacherous that just walking along it is enough to make me nervous!
%0%a001240
	It's funny that this cave just popped up out of nowhere. You never can tell with the underworld, can you?
%0%a001240
	Um, Dad... Are the m-monsters here in this cave really strong? (gulp)
%0%a001250
	Ow! My head hurts! I can feel something really powerful in here.
%0%a001250
	Um, can you hear something, or is it
	just my imagination?
Sancho
	Friend! Why are we een thees cave?
	We were eso near to our goal.
Sancho
	Uncle Sancho, he no like thees cave eso much.
	Eef I am een the lead, maybe I ees eslipping and walking on the bobo-trap floor.
Tuppence
	Dear me! Whatever is going on here? Why are the monsters so strong?
Tuppence
	Ah! I think I've figured it out! This is like a challenge to test our skills before the final battle!
Tuppence
	It's a shame they have to make the challenge so tricky, mind you...
Bianca
	Hang on a minute! Didn't we just come through here? Now I'm really confused.
Bianca
	Why do all the monsters in this place have to be so blimmin' strong!?
Bianca
	Do you think someone somewhere is tryin' to test us or somethin'?
Nera
	Haah... Haah... Are you alright, darling?
	The monsters in here are so formidable!
Nera
	We keep on moving forwards and yet it feels like we're always back in the same place. I hope we're not lost.
%0%a001240
	If we manage to beat the monsters here easily, that'll mean we're invincible, right?
%0%a001240
	Then I'm not going to be beaten! I'm going to keep on trying until I get the better of them!
%0%a001240
	Can you feel it too, Dad? We're being observed by something powerful. I can sense it.
%0%a001250
	Um... Which way did we come from again?
	And which way do we go now?
%0%a001250
	The walls are so high that it's impossible to see where we need to head for.
%0%a001250
	This cave is really weird. It feels like the paths between the different rooms in it keep changing.
Sancho
	My Majesty. Ees never too late to turn back eef theengs are becoming loco, no?
Sancho
	No one weell laugh at you, I promise.
Sancho
	Are you lost, friend?
Sancho
	At times like thees, there ees only one way to go.
	You must cast Evac!
Sancho
	No? Perdón, My Majesty. Esometimes, I estill theenk of you as a child.
Tuppence
	I don't know. This cave is quite a puzzle, I must say.
Tuppence
	Haah... Haah... The monsters here certainly put up quite a fight!
Tuppence
	I don't suppose I could trouble you to let me have a rest in the wagon every now and then, could I?
	I'm exhausted!
Bianca
	I can't help feelin' like we're goin' to get lost here. We'll have to watch out.
Bianca
	I know we dun't have time to hang about, %a000090, but maybe we should try goin' back a bit?
Nera
	I wonder how much longer this place
	stretches on for.
Nera
	Walking around aimlessly is just tiring us all out. We should think about going back every now and then.
%0%a001240
	I think I'm getting stronger and stronger all the time. Have you noticed, Dad?
%0%a001240
	We've come a long way in, haven't we?
	How much further do you think it goes?
%0%a001250
	All of the monsters here seem really angry.
	Do you think it's because we're here?
%0%a001250
	You can feel a breeze in here. Not like the maze we were in before.
Sancho
	Uf! Ees no time for siesta yet?
	There ees no day and night een thees monster underworld. How you know when to rest?
Sancho
	I wonder eef señor Pankraz, he knew about thees cave.
Tuppence
	Full speed ahead, Tuppence!
Tuppence
	Ha hah! I can handle anything this cave throws at me! Let's keep on pushing ahead!
Tuppence
	Thanks to all my adventures with you, I've become so much stronger than I used to be.
Tuppence
	No amount of training can give you the edge that real battle experience does!
Bianca
	Things are gettin' a bit tough. I hope we dun't run into any strong monsters now.
Bianca
	The monsters in here are so strong, I'll probably be havin' nightmares about 'em tonight.
Nera
	It seems we're out in the open again. What a relief!
Nera
	Be careful, darling. I'm sensing something terribly evil around us here.
%0%a001240
	Do you think Grandmaster Nimzo is even stronger than the monsters here, Dad?
%0%a001240
	Urgh. I'm starting to feel a bit giddy.
%0%a001250
	Oh no! I think I'm going to cry! There's something really scary nearby!
%0%a001250
	Ouch! My head feels like it's about to split in half. Maybe it's because of the monsters in this cave.
Sancho
	Ees no joke, thees cave, My Majesty. Ees eserious.
	We are too far eenside for jokes.
Sancho
	Now I am theenking, who ees wanting to build thees cave? And why?
Tuppence
	(puff puff) I think I'm about reaching my limit here, %a000090.
Tuppence
	The monsters here are just impossible. I feel totally powerless to stand up to them.
Bianca
	Ooh. Is this an aura or somethin'? Wow! I feel like it could blow me away in an instant!
Nera
	I can feel an incredible aura here. I can hardly even open my eyes, it's so strong!
%0%a001240
	Wow! What do you suppose that is?
%0%a001250
	That's who it was. The strong being I've been sensing all this time.
Sancho
	You know, sí, My Majesty? Thees monster, he ees more powerful than any monster you have locked horns weeth before.
Tuppence
	This is r-ridiculous! How can anyone give off such power when they're sleeping!?
Bianca
	Haah... Haah... I reckon that's the strongest monster I've ever fought!
Bianca
	I can hardly believe we came out of that one alive.
Nera
	It was a difficult battle, that's for sure. But I feel a lot more self-confident having triumphed.
Nera
	I couldn't have done it without you, though.
	Thank you so much, darling.
%0%a001240
	Yay! I did it! I did it! We're stronger than ever now!
%0%a001240
	What's this Catas Trophy all about? Did he make it so he could have an excuse to test our strength?
%0%a001240
	Heh heh! He was quite a funny character, that one!
%0%a001250
	I was really scared for a while, but I'm happy now we've won.
%0%a001250
	Poor Starkers, being forgotten like that.
%0%a001250
	I know! Maybe I could be Starkers's mum so he has someone to look after him!
Sancho
	Hahhh... Hahhh...
	I never...hahh...imagined...hahh...esuch...hahh...a monster!
Sancho
	I have lost eso much weight een thees battle,
	I must eat to myself a whole paella to recover!
Tuppence
	I'm alive! I'm still alive! It's a miracle!
Debora
	You're not doing too bad a job of things, so you take the lead here, okay?
Debora
	It's weird... I feel like I can't quite catch my breath.
Debora
	I used to feel stifled when I was forced to study, but this is a whole other level.
Debora
	You will protect me if it comes to it, right?
	I'll give you a hand and everything.
Debora
	Ugh. This is far too much exertion for me. Muscles I didn't even know I had are starting to ache.
Debora
	We're bound to get lost again on this path.
	Maybe we should think about turning back.
Debora
	Look at me a minute. ...Yep, you've got some spinach stuck in your teeth, you oaf!
Debora
	I sense something evil in the air. We'll have to go carefully and try not to get hurt.
Debora
	What is this!? What am I feeling? There's an aura so strong I can almost taste it!
Debora
	Haah... Haah...
	Well, we just about managed to pull through.
Debora
	Wait a minute! Why don't you seem tired, %a000090? You'll be in trouble if you were making me pick up your slack!
Debora
	That's odd. Weren't we here just now?
Debora
	Well, if you knew that, then hurry up and sort it out! Stop causing me headaches!
Debora
	I do hope you're not fobbing me off.
	Gentle as I am, I can lose my temper at times.
Debora
	Hmm... Fine. If you say we're not lost, I'll believe we're not lost.
