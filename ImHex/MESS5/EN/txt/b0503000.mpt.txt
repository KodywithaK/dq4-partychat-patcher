Bianca
	You choosin' me and this weddin' goin' ahead already... I dunno, it all feels so sudden.
Bianca
	But that dun't mean I en't happy about it.
	I've always bin a big fan of yours, %a000090.
Bianca
	This is the first time I've ever tried on any make-up. Do I look alright in it?
Bianca
	Thanks, %a000090. It feels a bit funny to me, that's all.
Bianca
	Ha ha! Yeah, I know. It dun't suit me, eh? I s'pose I'll just have to put up with it until the ceremony's over.
Bianca
	I'm still a bit bowled over, to be honest.
	I was sure you'd pick Nera, y'see.
Bianca
	Ha ha! This feels a bit awkward, dun't it? We've got time to get used to it, though. We'll be together all the time from now on.
Bianca
	It's a lovely day today, dun't you think? Bein' here where we got wed makes me feel all...happy inside!
Bianca
	It really was a wonderful weddin'.
	I'll never forget it as long as I live.
Bianca
	Ha ha! Children are so sweet, don't you think?
	I want one!
Bianca
	I s'pose Nera's right back to square one in lookin' for someone to marry now.
Bianca
	I hope she manages to find a perfect man just
	like I have.
Bianca
	Urgh! How disgustin'! I feel sorry for people havin' to serve the likes of him!
Bianca
	I s'pose it's pretty obvious, but I think marriage is amazin'. I've never bin happier.
Bianca
	I feel all embarrassed when folk say
	things like that!
Bianca
	That's good news. Nera will be relieved.
Bianca
	I hope we get to stay together until
	we're their age.
Bianca
	Crispin seems to have made a sudden recovery.
Bianca
	If he feels that strongly, then I reckon it's just a matter of time before he and Nera tie the knot.
Bianca
	I think it's because we grew up apart that we go so well together now. I want to do everythin' I can to support you, %a000090.
Bianca
	When I close my eyes here, I can imagine exactly how everythin' was durin' our weddin'.
Bianca
	D'you think I'll ever end up talkin' to you like that, %a000090?
Bianca
	Ha ha! I s'pose it's a good thing that you're prepared and expectin' it then!
Bianca
	Yeah. Hopefully you'll just do as you're told without me needin' to nag, eh! Ha ha!
Bianca
	I dun't mind makin' dinner for you, %a000090. Every now and then, anyway!
Bianca
	This maid's uniform is so pretty, dun't you think? Maybe old Mr Briscoletti had her wear it so he'd have somethin' nice to look at!
Bianca
	Looks like Harry and Maria have gone back already. That's a shame. I was hopin' to have a nice chat with the both of 'em.
Bianca
	Briscoletti's really generous, eh? I hope he dun't think we're takin' advantage of him.
Bianca
	So this is the Zenithian Shield? I can't
	explain why, but I feel almost like I've
	seen it somewhere before.
Bianca
	Ooh! What d'ya reckon, %a000090? The Ventuno sounds like fun, and I wouldn't mind travellin' around our old haunts a bit.
Bianca
	It's up to you, though. You can decide where we go. I'll be happy as long as I'm with you.
Bianca
	Yeah, I'm sure Nera will have no trouble findin' herself a nice bloke.
Bianca
	Um, %a000090... Do you ever regret not choosin' Nera over me?
Bianca
	Oi! Watch it! Else I'll really give you somethin' to regret! Ha ha!
Bianca
	That's good. I'll make sure you never regret it as long as you live.
Bianca
	When we have kids, it'd be fun for us all to go travellin' together as a family. ...Sorry! Am I gettin' ahead of myself a bit?
Bianca
	Let's always stay together, eh, %a000090?
Bianca
	I feel all embarrassed when folk say
	things like that!
Bianca
	I s'pose it's pretty obvious, but I think marriage is amazin'. I've never bin happier.
Bianca
	Yuck, yuck, yuck!
Bianca
	I hate havin' things like that said about me, especially by a drunk!
Bianca
	He wants a wife? Sounds like he'd be happy with anyone as long as she was a woman!
Bianca
	A lot of folk are sayin' things like that
	lately, eh? We'd better hurry up with this
	hunt for the hero.
Bianca
	That Crispin's certainly a determined one!
	It's good that he's makin' such an effort.
Bianca
	Her poor husband! I'll have to make sure I don't end up an old shrew like she is.
Bianca
	I hope Nera's happy too.
Bianca
	I can understand why you want to stop by here, %a000090.
Bianca
	I wonder what this place is. It dun't look like anyone lives here.
Bianca
	Maybe we'd be able to figure it out if we could get inside somehow.
Bianca
	You dun't think that Debora's a bit angry because you chose me, do you, %a000090?
Nera
	I hope you don't think I'm some kind of spoilt little rich girl just because I'm a bit quiet.
Nera
	I was just mulling over this strange feeling I have.
	A kind of conviction that I could be of great use to you on your travels.
Nera
	I know that Papa will be totally against the idea of me joining you on your journey.
Nera
	But I won't allow him to talk me out of it.
	Come on, let's go and tell him the news.
Nera
	I'm sorry that the wedding ceremony was so rushed.
Nera
	It was wrong of Papa not to take your feelings more into account with all of his grand plans.
Nera
	This place was built so that we would have space to house guests when they come to visit.
Nera
	Although, Mama sometimes uses it as a way of escaping from Papa when they have a tiff! He he!
Nera
	I know that Papa seems really stubborn, but I'm sure I'll be able to persuade him.
Nera
	We hardly had much chance to get to know each other before we were wed. But I know we'll make up for that from now on.
Nera
	I would never have forgiven Papa if anything bad happened to you.
Nera
	What a shame for that boy, losing his mother at his young age.
Nera
	No one could fail to feel sorry for the poor thing.
Nera
	I was so against Papa's idea of me marrying the man who returned the rings to him as he requested.
Nera
	But now I realise he was doing it so that I'd end up marrying the best possible person. He was just trying to make me happy.
Nera
	Oh dear! Drinking to that extent doesn't seem like a very good idea.
Nera
	What a waste when drink is so magnifico!
	...That's what Papa always says, anyway.
Nera
	I hope she manages to find her
	perfect match before long too.
Nera
	How lucky we are, being given all these
	good wishes from the townsfolk!
Nera
	I feel a little bit guilty when I see Crispin's parents.
Nera
	I think they were probably hoping that he and I would be married.
Nera
	I must admit that I was quite surprised too. Crispin's such a gentle sort. I don't think I've ever known him say a word in anger.
Nera
	I always knew how Crispin felt about me.
Nera
	But when we met, it was like some strange power was drawing me towards you.
Nera
	He he! Just like with those funny monsters you take around with you!
Nera
	Crispin always took care of me when I was small. If anything, I think of him as a sort of elder brother.
Nera
	It's just the two of us now, but hopefully we'll be a big happy family one day.
Nera
	Stop lazing about and put some tea on,
	you old waster!?
Nera
	...I just can't imagine ever saying that to anyone!
Nera
	I'm afraid that cooking isn't really my forte.
Nera
	I try my best, but I don't even come close to our cook when it comes to handling a cleaver!
Nera
	Bianca's not here any more. She's gone home. I can understand that you'd want to see her, though.
Nera
	You never look like you're able to relax when you're in this house, you know!
Nera
	I never heard about a jar being located in such an unlikely place.
Nera
	But those are the rules Papa has decided on if I'm to travel with you, so it must be important.
Nera
	So the Zenithian Shield has been right here all along.
Nera
	Maybe that's why... I've sometimes felt a strange power coming from it, you see.
Nera
	This means I can travel with you for as long as my heart desires. I'm so happy!
Nera
	I'm actually quite surprised that
	Papa relented so quickly.
Nera
	Maybe he had some kind of premonition that I'd set off travelling one day.
Nera
	I don't mind where we go. As long as I'm by your side, I'd be perfectly content anywhere.
Nera
	I'll give you as many children as you want, %a000090. Whatever will make you happy.
Nera
	We should be able to stay in the villa if we
	want to. Let's make sure we rest whenever
	and wherever we please.
Nera
	Travelling together has taught me the joy of being there for one another, %a000090.
Nera
	It's so dangerous everywhere nowadays, both in town and outside. What a terrible thing!
Nera
	That child... He's the same as me.
	...Um, never mind. It doesn't matter.
Nera
	He seems to be enjoying a good sleep.
	I hope he doesn't catch a cold.
Nera
	How lucky we are, being given all these
	good wishes from the townsfolk!
Nera
	I hope she finds someone nice.
Nera
	Wouldn't it be nice if everyone could find their perfect match?
Nera
	Forgetting about a problem for a while doesn't make it go away. You need to work at solving it. Little by little is better than nothing at all.
Nera
	Do you like it here? I still feel a bit upset when I'm inside this house.
Nera
	I always knew how Crispin felt about me.
Nera
	But when we met, it was like some strange power was drawing me towards you.
Nera
	He he! Just like with those funny monsters you take around with you!
Nera
	Crispin always took care of me when I was small. If anything, I think of him as a sort of elder brother.
Nera
	I wonder why he's not sleeping in a bed.
	Poor man!
Nera
	If you don't rub a bit harder, it won't help one little bit, you old waster!?
Nera
	...I just can't imagine ever saying that to anyone!
Nera
	Maybe it would be nice to stay over here sometimes. We could sleep in my old room.
Nera
	I think Papa has a few more grey hairs than before. Maybe I've been making him worry too much.
Nera
	It feels strange watching Mama sleeping like this.
Nera
	I'll do everything I can to help you find your own mother, I promise.
Nera
	We're exactly north-west from the La Guardia lookout tower here.
Nera
	Maybe this is what Papa was always looking at from up there.
Nera
	Let's hurry up inside and see what colour that jar is then, darling.
Nera
	So it was blue. I suppose we'd better get back and tell Papa. I do hope he lets me come travelling with you now.
Nera
	I wonder what could be inside that jar, and why it's sealed so tightly shut.
Nera
	Papa's never mentioned it before, so I really have no idea what it's all about.
Nera
	Oh dear, %a000090! I'm sure she was just joking.
	You must take it with a pinch of salt.
Nera
	I wonder if Debora's angry because you chose to marry me instead of her. I hope not!
Nera
	Bingo joined the family so that Debora wouldn't get lonely when I went to stay at the abbey.
Nera
	Unfortunately, I don't think she's ever been overly keen on him.
Nera
	Bingo joined the family so that Mama wouldn't get lonely when I went to stay at the abbey.
Nera
	Unfortunately, I don't think she's ever been overly keen on him.
Debora
	Now, you mustn't go getting it into your head that I'm coming along with you because I'd miss you or anything.
Debora
	I'm sure that Papa's bound to be against the idea.
Debora
	But there's nothing he can say that'll change my mind about going off travelling with you.
Debora
	I told you I don't like taking orders, but I suppose you do know a thing or two about fighting monsters.
Debora
	So I might let you give me advice on how to behave whenever we find ourselves in a battle. Can't say fairer than that.
Debora
	It's really dull here.
	Not to my taste at all.
Debora
	You do a good impression of listening to what people say, but I suspect you don't really pay attention half the time.
Debora
	Mostroferrato is quite a big town as towns go.
	I quite like it, actually.
Debora
	Well, obviously! I'm hardly likely to have settled for anything less.
Debora
	I'm afraid he's going to have a hard time of it trying to find someone as beautiful as me. We're few and far between.
Debora
	Bingo was a gift to me so that I wouldn't be lonely when Nera went to live at the abbey.
Debora
	I was never all that lonely, though. And I never really took to him, so Mama ended up looking after him most of the time.
Debora
	What's that supposed to mean? It's not like you ever seriously considered marrying Nera, did you?
Debora
	What a lout! Come on, %a000090!
	We're leaving.
Debora
	I suppose seeing me with my own personal slave is enough to make any woman want to get married.
Debora
	Why are you looking so pleased with yourself?
Debora
	The fine young specimen he was referring to was me, not you!
Debora
	What an irritating old woman! She says that as if Nera and Crispin are bound to get married, but it's not like anything's been decided.
Debora
	Crispin's father really doesn't seem to like me for some reason.
Debora
	I just don't understand it. I've always treated his son with the respect he deserves.
Debora
	Crispin's totally besotted with me, you know. That's why he spends so much time worrying about Nera. He's using her to get to me.
Debora
	All his efforts have come to nothing now I've married you, though.
Debora
	I suppose it could work out quite well if Nera did decide to be with Crispin.
Debora
	Not that I imagine for one minute that she will.
Debora
	What is it with nuns? Everything good always has to have been bestowed on us by the Goddess.
Debora
	I won't ever nag at you like that to make the tea. You'll just do it with no arguments.
Debora
	Yes, it's definitely important to get things straight from the very beginning.
Debora
	You and I have an understanding there, though, so we shouldn't have any trouble.
Debora
	So Bianca's gone home already.
Debora
	We had a bit of a chat when I was getting ready for our wedding ceremony. She's quite a nice girl actually, isn't she?
Debora
	Stupid girl! Fancy thinking we're visitors, especially when I'm right here with you!
Debora
	I don't see why Papa can't just go and check on the stupid jar himself.
Debora
	But if he's going to insist, then I suppose we'd better just hurry up and get it over with.
Debora
	So this is our family shield?
Debora
	It's strange, but I feel quite drawn to it.
Debora
	Papa's always been a complete worrywart.
Debora
	I'm sure that's why he's going so bald.
Debora
	Papa's boat...
	I remember going on it once ages ago.
	It was quite good fun, actually.
Debora
	You can decide where we go.
Debora
	We're going to the Ventuno, though, right?
Debora
	Charming! I don't take advantage of you, %a000090. I just tell it like it is.
Debora
	I'm sure Nera will find herself a man sooner or later.
Debora
	Fair enough. But don't go thinking I'll take care of you if you wear yourself out.
Debora
	And it's merrier still for you, with such a beautiful travelling companion on your arm!
Debora
	Bingo was a gift to me so that I wouldn't be lonely when Nera went to live at the abbey.
Debora
	I was never all that lonely, though. And I never really took to him, so Mama ended up looking after him most of the time.
Debora
	Absolutely, %a000090. You'd better make sure you look after me properly.
Debora
	What a greedy child!
	He has a father, doesn't he?
Debora
	Why do you seem to enjoy talking to people when they're asleep?
Debora
	Why are you looking so pleased with yourself?
Debora
	The fine young specimen he was referring to was me, not you!
Debora
	I suppose seeing me with my own personal slave is enough to make any woman want to get married.
Debora
	This might be a bit harsh, but I'd say he doesn't have a hope. Not with a face like that.
Debora
	What a weak and foolish man, turning to drink like that to forget his troubles.
Debora
	Is there any reason we've come to Crispin's house?
Debora
	Ah, I know! You've come to show me off, haven't you?
Debora
	I suppose he might suit Nera quite well.
Debora
	But he'll have to try at least a hundred times harder before he wins her heart.
Debora
	He's certainly got enthusiasm, I'll give him that much.
Debora
	I suppose we'll just have to sit back and let things take their course.
Debora
	Actually, my shoulders are aching a bit too.
	You'll rub them for me, won't you, %a000090?
Debora
	Time for bed already, is it?
Debora
	I suppose we could stay in my room then.
Debora
	What's Papa doing asleep here?
	Why doesn't he just go to bed?
Debora
	Watching Mama sleeping like that makes me feel all sleepy too.
Debora
	Hey! What do you think you're doing, coming into Nera's room like this!?
Debora
	Get out right now!
Debora
	I never knew there was a shrine here.
Debora
	It looks like it's been here a while too.
	The place is covered in dust.
Debora
	Apart from that blue jar, there doesn't seem to be anything else of interest here.
Debora
	Well, we've done what he wanted.
	Time to get back to Papa.
