*: 
	This is La Guardia, the lookout tower.
*: 
	Mr Briscoletti had it built so we'd know if ever monsters were coming to attack Mostroferrato.
*: 
	There's an old legend about a man who mastered control of evolution and turned himself into a monster.
*: 
	But the great evil within him provoked the anger of the gods, and he was sealed away in the underworld.
*: 
	He was known as Grandmaster Nimzo. If the legend's true, he'd be the ruler of the underworld for sure.
*: 
	Argh! The heat! It's...impossible to go any further!
Crispin
	I see I'm not the only one determined enough to get this far.
Crispin
	The Circle of Fire is in these caves somewhere.
	So...may the best man win!
Crispin
	Uuugh... It's so hot...
	My head feels like it's melting...
	But I won't give up!
~ There's a ring buried in the rock, shining like ~
~ a fiery ember. ~
~ %0%a000120 obtains the Circle of Fire! ~
~ %0%a000180 acquires the Circle of Fire. ~
Crispin
	If I succeed in becoming a man worthy of Nera, then maybe Debora will begin to respect me too.
*: 
	Welcome to Mostroferrato, ancient stronghold of the Briscoletti family.
*: 
	I've heard rumours, you know.
*: 
	People say the Briscoletti family shield is actually none other than the legendary Zenithian Shield.
*: 
	A man called Crispin just crawled into town with really bad burns all over him!
Bingo
	Aaarf, aaarf...
*: 
	You see? Crispin hurt himself really badly.
*: 
	You need to be careful. You'll definitely be wanting to buy a few useful items here before you go off again. It doesn't pay to be parsimonious!
*: 
	You got the Circle of Fire?
	Well you did better than Crispin, then.
	He came back in a terrible state.
*: 
	Mind you, he is being nursed by Nera,
	so it's not all bad!
*: 
	I wouldn't be surprised if you managed to get the Circle of Water too.
*: 
	If you change your mind about all this, you can always give me the ring, eh?
*: 
	No, I guess that's not going to happen!
*: 
	You'd be quite a catch, wouldn't you?
*: 
	I bet Nera's having a hard time making up her mind which boy to choose! Hee hee hee!
*: 
	So you're another suitor of Nera's, are you?
	Dear oh dear!
*: 
	Crispin suffered some very serious injuries in that cave of molten lava.
*: 
	He's caused everyone a lot of worry, including Nera. Honestly, what was he thinking?
*: 
	Nera says she feels responsible for what happened to Crispin, so she's been nursing
	him night and day.
*: 
	She's a fine lady, that Nera Briscoletti.
Nera
	Oh! %0%a000090...
Nera
	Crispin's suffered some terrible burns.
	His fever just won't drop.
Nera
	You're alright, aren't you?
Nera
	Oh, thank the Goddess. I'm so glad.
Nera
	What!? You're injured too?
	Oh, no! Where? What's wrong?
Nera
	Sorry? You were only joking? That's awful when Crispin's suffering so much!
Crispin
	Urgh... Nera...
	I've...fallen in lava...
*: 
	Stop lazing about and put some tea on,
	you old waster!
*: 
	Oh! You're not my husband!
	I, I do apologise.
*: 
	My wife manages everything to do with the shop. My job's taking care of the housework.
*: 
	It's great being married to someone who's so in control. Although...I can do some things myself.
*: 
	Marriage is a blessed union of two souls in the presence of the Goddess.
*: 
	She will bestow happiness upon any couple who truly love one another.
*: 
	This is Mr Briscoletti's villa. He doesn't get
	out here much, though. It's just that little bit
	too far away.
*: 
	Welcome to the Briscoletti residence.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Mamma mia! The Circle of Fire!
	Excellent work, %a000090.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I'll take it off your hands for now.
	That's alright with you, I trust?
~ %0%a000090 hands the Circle of Fire to ~
~ Mr Briscoletti. ~
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	So, all that remains for you to do is to bring me the Circle of Water and marry my bambina!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Use your brain now, boy. It's called the Circle of Water, so it'll be hidden in a place full of water, wouldn't you say?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	So! I'll give you free use of my ship. It's moored in the laguna just outside of town.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	It's just one of my smaller vessels, of course. A toy, if you will. But it should be plenty large enough for you and your friends.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Are you saying you'd rather have the Circle of Fire than my daughter's hand in marriage?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ha ha ha hah! You enjoy a good capriccio, as my grandfather used to say! Very funny, lad.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You say you obtained the Circle of Fire?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	But %a000090, my lad, unless I'm very much mistaken, you don't have it with you now.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ah! No doubt you've given it to one of your companions, haven't you?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Well hurry up and get it then.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Use your brain now, boy. It's called the Circle of Water, so it'll be hidden in a place full of water, wouldn't you say?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	So! I'll give you free use of my ship. It's moored in the laguna just outside of town.
*: 
	If you're looking for Nera, she's gone to the Burns's house to look after Crispin.
*: 
	All this reminds me of my courting days.
*: 
	Rodrigo was quite the Romeo himself, you know.
	He had to put himself in great danger to win my hand in marriage.
*: 
	He injured himself too. And I spent days and days looking after him at his bedside.
*: 
	I was attacked by monsters up in the mountains on my way here and I did my leg in.
*: 
	Fortunately a young lady from a nearby
	village happened to pass by and she dressed
	the wound for me.
*: 
	What an exceptional young woman to be out in the mountains all on her own!
*: 
	I lost my wife some time ago. She was killed by monsters while I was away travelling once.
*: 
	I wish I'd taken her with me now, even if it can be a bit dangerous at times.
Bingo
	Aaarf, aaarf...
*: 
	Zzz... Yeah! Come on, Dad!
	Let's get those monsterzzz...
	Zzz... Zzz...
*: 
	You'd be quite a catch, wouldn't you?
*: 
	I bet Nera's having a hard time making up her mind which boy to choose! Hee hee hee!
*: 
	So you're another suitor of Nera's, are you?
	Dear oh dear!
*: 
	Ah-phew, ah-phew...
*: 
	My Goddess! You got it! The Circle of Fire!
*: 
	You'll have to take it over to the Briscoletti mansion first thing. Amazing!
*: 
	I was going to narry Meraⓚⓛ Hic! To marry Nera, and get rinking stich. Hic! Really, really, rinking stich!
*: 
	I was going to get ⓚⓛ Hic! ⓚⓛ stinking rich, and have the biggest item shop on the continent! But instead, I'm just stinking drunk...
*: 
	Aaah! That's some good juice!
	You want to try some, lad?
	Go on, just one glass!
~ %0%a000090 downs the glass! ~
*: 
	Hey, are you alright, lad? You looked like you could take it, but maybe I was wrong.
*: 
	That's it! You're looking tough now, lad!
	Hah hah hah!
*: 
	No? Listen to me, lad! If you can't take your drink, you'll never have the guts to chat to the ladies.
*: 
	Crispin suffered some very serious injuries in that cave of molten lava.
*: 
	He's caused everyone a lot of worry, including Nera. Honestly, what was he thinking?
*: 
	Ah-phew...
	Debora...and Crispin...again...
Crispin
	Urgh... Nera... My heart...burns for you...
*: 
	Zzz... Zzz...
*: 
	If you don't rub a bit harder, it won't help one little bit, you old waster!
*: 
	Oh! You're not my husband!
	I, I do apologise.
*: 
	Everyone's gone to bed already, I'm afraid.
	Could you come back in the morning, please?
*: 
	Zzzz...
Bingo
	Arf! Bau bau!
Nera
	Crispin's temperature still won't drop thanks to all the terrible burns he suffered.
Nera
	I've been so worried about him, I thought I'd stay a bit longer.
*: 
	Oh, my goodness! A coffin!
*: 
	Go to the church at once, and pray to the Goddess that this poor person might live again!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ah, it's you, %a000090. And still without the Circle of Water, I see.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	But you're the likely lad who brought me the Circle of Fire. I've high hopes for you. Don't let me down!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Hm? Is this young lady a lover of yours?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ha ha hah! You young Casanova! But it's finito with the affairs if you marry my bambina, capice?
	We don't want a fiasco.
*: 
	I was attacked by monsters up in the mountains on my way here and I did my leg in.
*: 
	Fortunately a young lady from a nearby
	village happened to pass by and she dressed
	the wound for me.
*: 
	Good Goddess! It... It was you, wasn't it?
*: 
	I see. So you're Bianca? Well, Bianca, thank you once again. You saved my life.
*: 
	What was the name of your village again? Stockenbarrel, wasn't it? And you look after the lock, don't you?
*: 
	Right. So you're planning to go through the lock and up north in search of the Circle of Water?
	Well, good luck, then!
*: 
	Not like that sister of hers, Debora. What a snake! I'd steer well clear of that young madam if I were you.
Debora
	Who do you think you are?
	Is there a sign on the door saying
	ⓗscruffbags welcomeⓘ?
Debora
	Oh? You heard I was the older sister out of Nera and I, did you?
Debora
	So? What of it? If you think that means I'm looking to get married first, you can think again.
Debora
	How dare you come barging into my room with that peasant girl in tow! Get out!
*: 
	If only she'd have me, I'd personally go for the delicious Debora instead.
*: 
	If only she'd have me, I'd personally go for the delicious Debora instead.
*: 
	That makes me all the more ashamed of Debora's behaviour. The least she could do is tend to poor Crispin in his hour of need.
Debora
	What is it now? Do you want something, or not?
Debora
	Ooh! You got the Circle of Fire? And now you're here to brag about it, I suppose. You must have a lot of spare time on your hands.
Debora
	Then do me a favour and don't disturb me, okay?
*: 
	Welcome to Stockenbarrel!
*: 
	The baths are a-cookin', so the place be a bit full of folk just now.
*: 
	Purrr!
*: 
	That son of mine's only sayin' he wants to be a priest now, of all things!
*: 
	I dun't know what he gets up to, shut up indoors all the time.
*: 
	Come here up the river, did ya? I'll bet the lock had you scratchin' your head though, eh? There's no obvious way through him.
*: 
	Someone here in the village should be able to open him up for you, mind.
*: 
	............
~ She seems to be lost in prayer, and doesn't notice %a000090 standing beside her. ~
*: 
	Meow.
*: 
	Hello there. I bet you've come to relax in the water, eh?
*: 
	Just mind you dun't go soakin' too much.
*: 
	Wouldn't want to pass out, eh?
*: 
	Please, leave me alone. I'm trying to relax.
*: 
	I'll bet you're another one of those uptight fellas here to soak away your cares, en't you?
*: 
	Well enjoy it then, the water's lovely and warm!
*: 
	Oh well. Maybe next time, eh.
*: 
	I hear some folk have even moved here to Stockenbarrel to help 'em recover from illnesses and the like.
*: 
	I'm busy studyin' to be a priest, you know.
*: 
	There's apparently some kind of religious order out there at the moment collectin' money to build a White King's Paradise or suchlike.
*: 
	They say they'll keep you safe even if the end of the world comes and all that.
*: 
	That daughter of Whitey's, Bianca, is a real hard worker.
*: 
	He's a bit weak now because of some illness or other, so she goes off all over the place takin' care of things for the both of 'em.
*: 
	She really has got her head screwed on,
	that one.
*: 
	Sorry, mate.
	Pub en't open durin' the day.
~ ⓗSee ya, everyone! I'm off to join that religion and go to that White King's Paradise place!ⓘ ~
*: 
	You as well, eh? I don't blame you.
	The baths here turn up some real beauties.
*: 
	I'm talking about these bath crystals, of course!
	The famous Stockenbarrel scintillating sinter!
*: 
	I'm afraid no good things in life come for free, though. What I'd really like is a desert rose.
*: 
	You sometimes come across them in the desert. If you could find me one, I'd be more than happy to give you some sinter in exchange.
*: 
	Wait a minute! Don't go telling any of the villagers about this, okay? This is just between you and me.
*: 
	Oi! What d'you think you're doin', wanderin' about people's homes like you own the place!?
*: 
	I'm tryin' to work here. If you en't got no business, then I'd be leavin' if I was you.
*: 
	Meow.
*: 
	Come here up the river, did ya? I'll bet the lock had you scratchin' your head though, eh? There's no obvious way through him.

~ She seems to be lost in prayer, and doesn't notice %a000090 standing beside her. ~
*: 
	(splish splash)
*: 
	Aaah! You can't beat havin' the baths pretty much to yourself.
*: 
	Once, when I travelled upriver long ago, I came across a ginormous cave.
*: 
	I was too scared to go inside. More's the pity, because I'll bet there's all sorts of treasure hidden in there.
*: 
	I'm busy studyin' to be a priest, you know.
*: 
	Goo! Goo!
*: 
	That husband of mine! He may as well up sticks and move to the pub, the amount of time he spends there!
*: 
	Zzzz...
*: 
	Ah-phew...
*: 
	Ah-phew...
	Bianca... Zzzz...
*: 
	There's apparently some kind of religious order out there at the moment collectin' money to build a White King's Paradise or suchlike.
*: 
	They say they'll keep you safe even if the end of the world comes and all that.
*: 
	I dunno, though. I've bin around a bit meself so I'm not so naive as some. The whole thing sounds a bit fishy to me.
*: 
	There's a chap called Whitey livin' at the far end of the village. That daughter of his is a real beauty.
*: 
	What I'd give to be able to marry that one! My right arm at the very least!
*: 
	He's gone an' fallen asleep over his drink again.
*: 
	He says it's all for Bianca's sake, but I still say 'e works too 'ard.
*: 
	All work an' no play en't no good to no one, that's what I say. A bit of work, then a bit of a drink...everythin' in moderation. Hic!
*: 
	Dear, oh dear. The fella from the weapon shop's on his tenth already. His wife'll have his guts for garters when he gets home.
*: 
	Purrr...purrr...purrr...
Whitey
	(cough cough)
	Hm? Is someone there?
Whitey
	Hello there.
Whitey
	Hm? Who are you?
	Haven't we met somewhere before?
Whitey
	No! I dun't believe it!
	You're Pankraz's boy!
Whitey
	Good grief! What a turn-up for the books!
	You're alive after all these years, %a000090!
Whitey
	You haven't half grown as well. You were just a little boy the last time I saw you. I remember you and my Bianca playin' about together.
Whitey
	So how's old Pankraz doin' then?
	Keepin' well, is he?
%0%a000090
	............
Whitey
	Oh no...
	What a terrible thing...
Whitey
	It must've bin helluva tough for you then, %a000090, all on your lonesome.
Whitey
	Things have bin hard on us too since I lost my lovely wife.
Whitey
	She was always so much stronger than me.
	I never expected her to go first.
Whitey
	Come to think of it, did you not see Bianca on your way over here?
Whitey
	You probably would've passed her tendin' to her mother's grave.
*: 
	I'm back!
Whitey
	Bianca! Look who's here!
	It's %a000090!
Whitey
	Your old friend %a000090's still alive after all these years!
Bianca
	I knew it! %0%a000090!
	I knew you'd still be alive!
Bianca
	And there's %a001210 with you too!
	Haven't you grown, %a001210!?
Bianca
	I heard all about Whealbrook bein' torched and you goin' missin', %a000090.
Bianca
	But I always had faith you'd survived it
	all somehow.
Bianca
	You promised we'd have another adventure together one day, after all. I knew you wouldn't go back on that.
Bianca
	It's hard to believe it's bin ten years, though.
Bianca
	You and I have got a lot to talk about, eh?
	I hope you're not in any hurry to get away.
Bianca
	Eh? You haven't got much time to hang around?
Bianca
	Crikey! You have to find some ring called the Circle of Water so you can get married!?
	Now there's a turn-up!
~ %3Bianca and %a000090 talk late into the night about all that has happened in the ten years since they last met.%4 ~
~ %3And then, day breaks...%4 ~
Bianca
	Morning, %a000090!
	Sleep well?
Bianca
	I'm just in the middle of gettin' breakfast ready, so you might want to get yourself up before long, eh?
Bianca
	Where you off to in such a hurry, %a000090?
	Breakfast'll be ready in a mo.
Bianca
	Feelin' a bit peckish, are you? Ha ha!
	Just give us a minute, eh, %a000090?
Whitey
	Can I have a word, %a000090? Don't go breathin' any of this to Bianca, but...
Whitey
	Well, you see, she's not actually my
	real daughter.
Whitey
	And that just makes me all the more protective of her than ever. All I want is for her to be happy.
Whitey
	Look at the state of me! I'm weak and frail,
	and I don't know how much longer I might
	have in this world.
Whitey
	That's why I want to ask you to take care of Bianca for me, %a000090. I could rest in peace knowin' you two were together.
Bianca
	Breakfast's up, %a000090!
	Come and get it!
Bianca
	There's somethin' I've bin meanin' to ask you. You can keep eatin' while we chat, though.
Bianca
	It's just, I've bin thinkin' about what you
	said yesterday.
Bianca
	And I've decided I want to help you find that Circle of Water!
Bianca
	I want you to be happy, see, %a000090. You can't say fairer than that. So, what do you say?
Bianca
	Ha ha! It'll be great fun to go on another little adventure together. Just like old times!
Bianca
	Make sure you come and get me when you're ready to leave, eh?
Bianca
	Oh, go on! You en't gettin' through the lock without me there to open it for you after all,
	so you have to say yes!
Whitey
	Can I have a word, %a000090? Don't go breathin' any of this to Bianca, but...
Whitey
	Well, you see, she's not actually my
	real daughter.
Whitey
	And that just makes me all the more protective of her than ever. All I want is for her to be happy.
Whitey

Bianca
	Ready to go already, %a000090?
Bianca
	I'll have that lock open for you in no time.
	Come on!
~ Bianca joins %a000090! ~
~ %0%a000180 returns to the wagon. ~
~ But the wagon's already full! ~
~ Pick someone to send to Monty's monstergarten. ~
Bianca
	Oh, go on! You en't gettin' through the lock without me there to open it for you after all,
	so you have to say yes!
Bianca
	Ha ha! It'll be great fun to go on another little adventure together. Just like old times!
Whitey
	You'll know how it feels havin' lost your father, %a000090, but my Bianca must be lonely from time to time.
Whitey
	I haven't seen her look so happy in ages as she looked when she laid eyes on you again.
Whitey
	You take good care of her, won't you?
Bianca
	Dad! Shush! You're embarrassin' me!
*: 
	Welcome to Stockenbarrel!
*: 
	Well, hello there, young Bianca.
	Lovely weather again today, eh?
*: 
	If you go upriver from the lock, you apparently end up at a really big lake.
*: 
	Hello there. I bet you've come to relax in the water, eh?
*: 
	Just mind you dun't go soakin' too much.
*: 
	Wouldn't want to pass out, eh?
*: 
	Ooh! It's the lovely Bianca!
	Come for a bath, have you, darlin'?
*: 
	Please, leave me alone. I'm trying to relax.
*: 
	Your skin's just so lovely!
	I wish mine was as soft as that.

	I'll bet you're another one of those uptight fellas here to soak away your cares, en't you?
*: 
	Well enjoy it then, the water's lovely and warm!
*: 
	Oh well. Maybe next time, eh.
*: 
	Wow! You're really pretty!
	Is that because of the bath water?
	Nah, in my dreams, right!?

~ There's no way of getting by. ~
Bianca
