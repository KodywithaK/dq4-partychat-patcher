	By that there Goddess, the fields are a proper mess again!
*: 
	If 'e goes on like this much longer, we'll be dyin' of starvination an' 'unger.
*: 
	This 'ere is 'Ay. You fancy folk'd prob'ly call it Hay.
*: 
	Only what with that bissly wolf monster scat'n the fields abroad, we en't got much 'ay to gather.
*: 
	My 'ole life I's lived 'ere, but I'm thinkin' we'll 'ave to 'ead off into them there 'ills afore long.
*: 
	Granny's bin actin' all funny lately.

	She only eats one little dollop of 'er food an' then gives the rest to me. Says she's full, she does.

	Arf! Arf arf!

	Neeeigh!
*: 
	Neeeigh!
*: 
	I dunno 'ow much you bin offered for gettin' rid of our monster.
*: 
	But you can't do nort with the gold if you get yourself killed.
*: 
	Mind you, I dun't s'pose you'd go that far now, would you? You en't from 'round these parts, so what's 'e to you, eh?
*: 
	Well, I'll be! A customer!
*: 
	What d'you want? Pa's over Bailiff Bails's place, if that's who you're after.
*: 
	You know, the place with them 'orses outside.
*: 
	I can 'ardly muster the energisms to do anythin' these daisies. I'm so 'ungry!

Bailiff Bails
	So your idea's to pick up someone what'll 'elp us at the pub in Lodestar 'Arbour. That's the plan, is it?
*: 
	That's it, Bailiff. Them gets some proper feisty scrappers in that there pub.

Bailiff Bails
	You must be the bay 'as bin asked to 'elp us. From the pub, wun't it?
Bailiff Bails
	I'm most oblimigated that you's come down 'ere to 'Ay. Thank 'e kindly.
Bailiff Bails
	We's all prayin' to the Goddess that you can 'elp.
Bailiff Bails
	So, then. 'Bout this monster what's bin causin' all the palaver...
Bailiff Bails
	â“™E looks as part wolf an' part lion.

*: 
	A warm and windy welcome to Zoomingale!
*: 
	I dunno! What's that Professor Toilen Trubble
	up to now, eh?
*: 
	The smoke comin' from his place is a right killer! (cough cough)
*: 
	Ooh! On your travels, are you?
	Are you having a nice time?
*: 
	That's good. You can't beat
	a bit of what you fancy.
*: 
	Oh dear. Been a bit of a tough one, has it?
	Then I suppose you must have good reason for carrying on in the face of it.
*: 
	Good luck!
*: 
	I hear there was a splendid wedding ceremony over at Coburg not too long ago.
*: 
	I think it was the King's elder brother, Prince Harry, who was wed. If I remember rightly, anyway.
*: 
	I would've so loved to see
	the royal wedding for myself.
*: 
	I'll bet the bride was as pretty as a picture.
*: 
	Oh blast! I'm lost again!
*: 
	The paths around this town are so complicated that I just can't seem to find my way!
*: 
	Aah. You can't beat the feeling of a nice breeze.
~ â“—Wanted: magic research assistant. ~
~ Head south at this corner to apply.â“˜ ~
*: 
	This is utterly ridiculous!
*: 
	No one in their right mind would put up with this dreadful situation!

	I do apologise. ãˆ¢ãˆ¢
	It's just...er...ãˆ¢you see...
	ãˆ¢ãˆ¢
dy and I...
@c0@þþ@a
	*: It's just that the room...ãˆ¢ãˆ¢...isn't quite...er...
*: 
	I came along here because I was interested in meeting the old researcher here who's doing some work with spells.
*: 
	He's apparently going to great lengths to try to revive ancient spells that have long been out of use.
*: 
	It don't look like the pub's open yet.
	Uhh, I need a drink!
*: 
	Heh heh! About time too!
	Hurry up and gimme a drink, will ya?
*: 
	Eh? You don't work 'ere?
	Crikey! Sorry!
*: 
	Right then, looks like I'm ready
	for another night of serving.
*: 
	Hm? Zoomshine? Ooh, no. We don't stock that!
	No one in their right mind would drink it.
*: 
	Ah-phew, ah-phew...
*: 
	There always seems to be smoke coming from old Professor Toilen Trubble's house.
*: 
	I'm more than a little bit worried that he'll set fire to the place one of these days.
*: 
	Yum yum!
*: 
	Nothing makes people happier than
	tucking into some tasty food, I say!
*: 
	Everything else is just by the by, in my opinion.
*: 
	Darkness is attempting to eat into our world.
*: 
	But there is no need to be afraid.
*: 
	When the time comes, the legendary hero will reappear to rescue us all.
*: 
	Talkin' of legends, have you heard of the local brew, Zoomshine?
*: 
	Oh, right. You young travellers certainly know your stuff then, eh?
*: 
	It's been around for about a hundred years now. â“—Life is but a drinkâ“˜, that's what those who know about it say.
*: 
	It's such potent stuff that it even has the power to frighten monsters away!
*: 
	You can't buy it at the pub any more. It's pretty much impossible to get hold of nowadays.
*: 
	(BANG BANG) This is going to be a great piece of armour when I'm finished with it.
*: 
	You there! If you're after some fantastic
	armour, come back to my shop at night
	and check out my stock!
Professor Toilen Trubble
	What is it? What do you want? You're not another person come here to complain about the smoke,
	are you?
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Pah! What I do in my own home is up to me.
	It's none of your business!
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Now, you're getting in the way of my research.
	I'll have to ask you to leave.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Then you must be here to observe my research.
	How nice of you to take an interest!
Professor Toilen Trubble
	If I'm successful with my current project, I'll manage to revive a long-lost spell.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	And a wonderful spell it is too! It allows you
	to travel effortlessly between different places you've visited.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Can you imagine how convenient that would be?
Professor Toilen Trubble
	So, what do you think? Are you willing to help me out with my work?
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Ooh! How wonderful!
	Then follow me.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Have a little look at this map here.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Here we are in Zoomingale, see?
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Now, what I need is some of the lunar Zoombloom that can be found growing...right here.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	And I'd like you to go and fetch it for me.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	You can only go picking it at night, though.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	That's when it starts shining and
	giving away its location.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	So, what do you think? Do you need me to
	explain all that again?
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Wonderful!
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Well, I'll catch myself forty winks and wait for you to come back with the Zoombloom.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Pah! You may dress up like an adventurer, but it seems you're nothing more than a coward, after all.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Now, you're getting in the way of my research.
	I'll have to ask you to leave.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Aaaaaah. I'm so sleeeeeepy...
Professor Toilen Trubble
	The lunar Zoombloom glows bright as anything at night... Zzzz...
*: 
	Meow?
*: 
	Professor Toilen Trubble is
	a real claws for worry.
*: 
	His garden would be just purrfect for a cat nap if only it wasn't so smoky.
*: 
	I feel a little bit better now I've let the cat out of the bag and confided in you, though.
*: 
	Let me tell you something
	purrtinent by way of thanks.
*: 
	All over the world, there are special regional items purrculiar to each location.
*: 
	If you travel around a lot, you should try
	to collect them. Then you'll be like the cat
	that got the cream!
*: 
	Meow...
*: 
	Good evening. A warm and windy
	welcome to Zoomingale!
*: 
	Oh no! Not another dead end!
*: 
	The paths around this town are so complicated that I just can't seem to find my way!
*: 
	I'm sorry, my lady...
	I, er, I...
	Zzzz...
*: 
	How absurd, expecting me to share
	a room with that man!
*: 
	I rue the day I engaged his company!
*: 
	The Goddess deserted us long ago! (sob)
*: 
	Another drink, please, miss!
	Amen to that... Hic!
*: 
	I'm afraid the priest's a bit
	worse for wear tonight.
*: 
	Have you ever visited Hay, the village to the south of Lodestar Harbour?
*: 
	Then you probably had just as horrible an experience there as I did. What a place!
*: 
	Then I'd advise you to stay
	well away from the place.
*: 
	The people there are absolutely hideous in the way they treat outsiders.
*: 
	This ain't supposed to be common knowledge, but Professor Toilen Trubble is always missin' one vital ingredient for his research.
*: 
	According to ancient legend, there's a tower somewhere that leads right up into the heavens.
*: 
	Ooh, searching for the legendary hero, you say? But you don't have much to go on?
*: 
	I know! You should collect up all
	the Zenithian Equipment.
*: 
	If the legendary hero really exists, he'll be looking for exactly the same thing. Then maybe you'll bump into each other!
*: 
	Oh! I just can't seem to get to sleep!
*: 
	ZZZZ! ARGH-PHEW!
*: 
	Apparently Prince Harry, the King of Coburg's elder brother, got married not too long ago.
*: 
	I'd love to see what kind of woman his bride is!
*: 
	Aaah! This is heaven!
*: 
	You can't beat a nice, cool drink just
	after you get out of the bath.
*: 
	Everything else is just by the by, in my opinion.
*: 
	What? This is Zoomshine!?
*: 
	That's absurd! I wouldn't drink something that disgusting, surely...!? Ha ha ha!

*: 
	After some weapons, are ya, mate? Then you'd better come back durin' the day.
*: 
	I just rent this place of a night, see.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Ooh! How wonderful! You brought the
	lunar Zoombloom.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	So this is what it looks like.
	How very exciting!
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Let's try it out right away!
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Pah! Don't interrupt me now!
	Can't you see I'm busy?
Professor Toilen Trubble
	...This is it! Now all I have to do is take the lunar Zoombloom and...
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Hmph. That's odd.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	I was expecting that to have
	revived the old spell, Zoom.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	It would be wonderful if you'd be so kind as to try out whether the spell's working again now or not.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	I say! What are you up to?
Professor Toilen Trubble
	It would be wonderful if you'd be so kind as to try out whether the spell's working again now or not.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Ooh! Wonderful!
	We did it! We did it!
Professor Toilen Trubble
	That's the way! Now I'll move right on to the next spell and see if I can keep up this run of good luck!
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Ooh! Have you come back to learn another spell?
Professor Toilen Trubble
	I'm afraid this one's proving to be rather tricky.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	I'm even starting to wonder if I'll manage to have it cracked during my lifetime at this rate!
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Fair enough. Just here to relax then, are you?
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Come to think of it, I wanted to give you a reward for helping me to make a success of the Zoom spell.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	I've been saving it for you especially...
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Here it is! A bottle of the legendary Zoomshine.
	Now you can find out for yourself if life really is but a drink!
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Hm? What is it? You look rather troubled.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Oh! I see. You've been taken in by what the townspeople told you, have you? Ha ha ha!
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Zoomshine is a very precious local brew only to be found in Zoomingale. And it tastes just wonderful!
Professor Toilen Trubble
	But it takes a terribly long time to make it, and there's barely a drop of it around nowadays.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	If outsiders found out about it and demand spread, it would be chaos, you see.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	So that's why we all fib a little. We don't
	mean anything bad by it. Here you are,
	anyway. This one's yours!

	Welcome to Coburg.
*: 
	Ever since Prince Harry came home, this place has been gettin' better by the day!
*: 
	Prince Harry's wife really is a lovely girl!
*: 
	I always wanted to marry someone like her.
	It's a bit late for me now, mind!
*: 
	Woof woof.
*: 
	There used to be a craftsman at Gotha Castle so good at his work that he was dubbed the King of Jewellers!
*: 
	If only he were here now, I'm sure he'd make a splendid job of Prince Harry's commemorative music box.
*: 
	Welcome to Coburg Castle!
*: 
	Do you know the tale about the great castle that fell from the sky a long, long time ago?
*: 
	Apparently, it's since that day that monsters have been terrorising mankind again.
*: 
	Hey! You're the one who defeated the Faux Dowager!
*: 
	Thanks to you, Coburg is well on its way back to normality. Thank you so much!
*: 
	The Queen Dowager has certainly quietened down her act since everything that happened.
*: 
	And King Wilbur has been a great surprise. I think a lot of people doubted whether he'd make a good ruler, but he's proving them all wrong now!
*: 
	Prince Harry and his wife seem so incredibly happy together.
*: 
	It makes us single chaps feel all the more lonely! Ha ha ha!
*: 
	Oh! Hello again! Remember me? I'm the old man from down in the jail.
*: 
	They let me out in the end, and now I'm being looked after beautifully.
*: 
	I can't tell you how grateful I am!
	Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
*: 
	These are Darwin the Psarologist's quarters.
*: 
	Hello there. The name's Darwin. I spend my time researching all about living things.
Darwin
	How have humans and other creatures evolved in the way they have? And could they ever develop into something more powerful?
Darwin
	It seems there was once a secret that unlocked these mysteries of evolution. Perhaps it was the hand of the Goddess.
*: 
	These are the Queen Dowager's quarters.
Queen Dowager
	Ah! How lovely to see you back!
	You really helped us out of a pickle that time.
Queen Dowager
	I still can't really fathom how things ended up in such a terrible mess.
Queen Dowager
	It seems monsters may be trying to eat into the very fabric of our fragile world.
Queen Dowager
	You must take care.
*: 
	What a beautiful young wife Prince Harry has found for himself!
*: 
	I don't think I could be any happier!
*: 
	I must admit I'm a bit disappointed.
	I had rather set my sights on marrying Prince Harry myself!
King Wilbur
	Ah, hello there! What a pleasure to see you!
	I've been hearing all about you from that brother of mine.
King Wilbur
	I've been having my people look into this matter of the legendary hero for you. Sort of as a means of repaying my debt, you know.
King Wilbur
	Now, they've managed to learn that the shield used by this legendary hero currently resides in a town called Mostroferrato.
King Wilbur
	It seems this town is in Southern Zephyrus, the continent to the west of here. It's south of Zoomingale, if that helps.
King Wilbur
	You're probably itching to dash off there, but you must drop in on Harry before you do.
	His room's just upstairs.
Chancellor
	We owe absolutely everything to you, dear %a000090! Everything!
Chancellor
	By the way, I hear they have some rather interesting goods on sale in Fortuna. Have you procured any for yourself?
Chancellor
	Ha ha! I might've known!
	Good for you, %a000090!
Chancellor
	Then you should at least pop over there and pick up â“—The Big Book of Beastsâ“˜. I imagine it would be incredibly useful on your travels.
Chancellor
	We owe absolutely everything to you, dear %a000090! Everything!
Chancellor
	By the way, if I remember rightly, Mostroferrato is where that rich man, Rodrigo Briscoletti, lives.
Chancellor
	He apparently owns not one, but several large ships. His name's all over the port towns all around the world.

	I've been looking for you all over the place.
Harry
	You see... I, er, wanted to invite you to my wedding!
Harry
	That's right! I'm a married man now!
Maria
	It's lovely to see you again, %a000090.
Harry
	Ha ha ha!
	I suppose the situation speaks for itself, really!
Harry
	Truth be told, Maria probably preferred you to me all along.
Maria
	Harry, don't be silly!
Maria
	I'm sure there's someone out there who's just perfect for %a000090, though.
Harry
	Yes, yes.
	Anyway, it's great to see you, old friend!
Harry
	It's a shame you couldn't make it to the wedding, but I saved a souvenir for you at least.
Harry
	Remember my old room?
	Go and have a look inside the chest there.
Maria
	Coburg's finest music-box maker crafted us some commemorative souvenirs for our wedding.
Maria
	I don't know why Harry's gone and hidden one inside the chest in his old room, though.
	How curious!
~ %0%a000120 examines the treasure chest. ~
~ It's empty! ~
~ But there seem to be some letters carved on the bottom. %0%a000090 begins to read. ~
~ â“—I was too embarrassed to say this to your ~
~ face, %a000090, so I thought I'd write it ~
~ here instead. ~
~ â“—There's not a day goes by even now when I don't spare a moment to remember your father. ~
~ â“—During our time as slaves, I always had an urge to make it up to you, the fact that I'd lived when he died. ~
~ â“—It was that urge that took me through each day and helped me survive that awful time. ~
~ â“—I don't imagine there's anything in my power I can do to assist you in your quest for the legendary hero. ~
~ â“—But it's my sincere hope that ruling this kingdom wisely and protecting my people will be of some help to you in some way or other. ~
~ â“—You'll always be my lackey, %a000090... Ha ha ha! No, you'll always be my dear friend.â“˜ ~
Harry
	Hm? You couldn't find the wedding souvenir in the treasure chest?
Harry
	Ha ha ha! You're just as easy to trick as you
	ever were!
Harry
	Very well. I'll give it to you properly this time.
~ Harry proffers a beautifully crafted marital organ! ~

Harry
	We actually intended to have a jewel set in the lid, but we couldn't find anyone able to do it.
Harry
	Anyway, it's great to see you. You should relax and stay a while now you've come all this way.
Harry
	You certainly seem to have an awful lot on your plate, %a000090.
Harry
	But have you never thought of adding to it by finding yourself a bride?
Harry
	I knew it! It comes to us all at this age,
	you see!
Harry
	You'll find a beauty like mine in no time, I'm sure!
Maria
	Harry! ...Th-Thank you!
Harry
	I see. Finding your mother is the
	absolute priority.
Harry
	But don't forget she's probably the one person 
	in this world who wants to see you happy more than anyone.
Harry
	Maybe you should sort your own life out first, and then who knows where it will lead you...! Hah!
Maria
	I wonder what kind of woman you'll marry, %a000090.
Maria
	Make sure you invite us to the wedding,
	won't you?
*: 
	Meeeow!
*: 
	Another end to another peaceful day! Prince Harry and his wife still seem so in love. Aaaah!
*: 
	Who can drame a man for blinking at a time like this!? Hic!
*: 
	The stars are so pretty. Aaah!
*: 
	Woof woof woof woof woof!
*: 
	This is just between you and me, but there are some really terrifying monsters attacking people over on that continent Apeliotes to the east.
*: 
	Some folk there are even saying that the end of the world is upon us.
*: 
	I'm really pleased my sister's back from Fortuna safe and sound.
*: 
	But she's changed so much. She used to be so hard-working, but now she seems to be going out all the time.
*: 
	I don't know whether to be happy or sad!
*: 
	Hello there, young man! Aren't you lovely! How would you like to have your fortune told?
*: 
	Oh! You've never had your fortune told before?
*: 
	Hmm... I sense that perhaps you're not ready quite yet. Maybe one day when you're all grown up and married.
*: 
	Well, not to worry. The spirits tell me that the girl for you is just around the corner!
*: 
	Hello there, young man! Aren't you lovely! How would you like to have your fortune told?
*: 
	Yay! Come and meet me in the gardens to the north of the castle tomorrow lunchtime!
*: 
	Are you sure?
	That's a pity!
*: 
	Yay! You came! Ready to have your fortune told?
*: 
	Okay, focus your thoughts. I'm about to start...
*: 
	Zha zha doo!
	Zha zha da!
	Zha zha zha zho HAH!
*: 
	Zha zha doo!
	Zha zha da!
	Zha zha zha zho HAH!
*: 
	And finally, booloolooloolooloo!
	Balabolabalabolabooboobolaboo!
	BOO!
~ Aah-aah-aaaah-CHOO! ~
~ %0%a000120 tries to hold back a sneeze, but fails! ~
*: 
	Oh! It's just as the spirits told me:
	â“—The mighty warrior of old,
	Shall sneeze as if he had a coldâ“˜!
*: 
	I'm still only a trainee fortune-teller, you see, and I tend to wave too much incense about the place.
*: 
	It gets right up people's noses, and they end up sneezing everywhere. That's why nobody wants me to tell their fortune.
*: 
	But I'm going to work hard and become the best fortune-teller ever, you'll see. Even better than that Mystic Mridula over in Fortuna.
*: 
	Oh, you're not quite prepared?
	Okay. I'll be waiting here when you're ready.
