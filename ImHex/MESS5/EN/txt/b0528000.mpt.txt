Bianca
	Here again, eh? I wonder how many mini medals we've got now.
Bianca
	It's always so hot here. I bet it's impossible tryin' to sleep of a night.
Nera
	This tiny castle tucked away on its own island in the south is like a little world all of its own.
Nera
	Mini medals are so pretty and sweet. I can understand why people start collecting them.
%0%a001240
	I know, Dad! Why don't we have a race and see who can run around the castle the fastest?
%0%a001240
	A tiny little castle on a tiny little island.
	It looks just like a toy!
%0%a001250
	Every single thing here seems to glisten and shine.
	My eyes are starting to get worn out!
%0%a001250
	Huh. It's a bit hot here, isn't it?
Sancho
	Thees castle, ees esmall, but ees made well, si?
	Eef esomething ees made well, ees okay to be esmall.
	But n-no the paella. The paella, eet m-must be beeg!
Sancho
	Thees place, ees een the m-m-middle of the sea. Every day they g-gonna have the fr-fresh fish, no? Si, ees p-perfect for the paella.
Tuppence
	It's rather on the small side for a castle. I think I'll be setting my sights somewhat higher when I build mine.
Tuppence
	I'm rather impressed at how anyone could manage to survive out here on this island, aren't you?
Bianca
	You can't knock him for bein' ambitious, but can slimes even make themselves bigger through trainin'?
Nera
	How funny to see a slime in training! But if it wants to be like the one on the roof, I'd say eating a lot would be the answer.
%0%a001240
	That was training? It looked more like bouncing about to me.
%0%a001250
	What a clever little slime! Maybe I'll start training so I can be big and strong, too!
Sancho
	I n-never imagine I would m-meet a slime weeth dreams! Ees amazing!
Tuppence
	Maybe I should put in a bit of training. It wouldn't do to be bested by a measly little slime.
Bianca
	He's right there. Them chocolate medalliyums
	are delicious.
Bianca
	Er... Sorry, %a000090. Truth is, I used my own savings to buy some, and I ended up wolfin' down the lot!
Nera
	I think you'd need to be quite brave to wander about in your pyjamas all the time.
%0%a001240
	I love chocolate medalliyums! But Sancho said we can only eat a maximum of two at a time.
%0%a001250
	I like eating chocolate, but Sancho's always such a nag afterwards trying to get me to clean my teeth.
%0%a001250
	I don't think I'll bother having any today.
Sancho
	Djou collect these m-mini medals too, si, chico?
Sancho
	I n-no believe another señor, he ees collecting thees estupid bric-a-brac. The whole world, ees l-loco!
Tuppence
	Powjamas? They sound like just the kind of nightwear for a strapping young warrior like me!
Bianca
	Um, d'you reckon the bank here's above board, %a000090? It smells a bit fishy to me.
Nera
	He seems like a trustworthy fellow. It's nice to know he takes such good care of his customers' money.
%0%a001240
	There was something a bit too jolly about him.
	I'm not sure if I trust him or not.
%0%a001250
	I feel all nervous now. It's like we're being put to the test to see if we trust in people.
Sancho
	Ees a j-joke? Or thees señor, he ees eserious?
Sancho
	Eef we ask heem to p-put a galleon of garbanzos een hees pocket, ees n-no gonna go, eh?
Tuppence
	There's plenty of space in my pocket if you
	need more!
Tuppence
	...Oh. No one's listening, as usual.
Bianca
	Blimey! What a delicious-smellin' chocolate! That smell alone is enough to send you wobbly!
Nera
	Seeing this  chocolate medalliyum reminds me of Papa.
Nera
	He used to be really skinny when he was younger, apparently. But then he developed a taste for these and there was no looking back.
%0%a001240
	Yay! Chocolate! Is it okay if we eat it later, Dad?
%0%a001250
	If you eat too much chocolate, you get fat.
	That's what Gertie told me, anyway.
Sancho
	No, no. N-No chocolate for djour Uncle Sancho.
	No, no, no. I must l-l-lose esome weight.
	To m-make espace for the paella.
Tuppence
	Looks rather tasty, I must say. Perhaps I should buy one to take home to Mother.
Bianca
	I could eat these chocolate medalliyums until the cows come home, but I suppose we shouldn't be too frivolous, eh?
Nera
	We mustn't overindulge in these 
	chocolate medalliyums, otherwise
	we'll get fat. Let's not buy too many.
%0%a001240
	Oh! Aren't you getting any?
Bianca
	Uh-oh. Looks like we en't bin managin' our finances all that well if we can't even afford to buy chocolate.
Nera
	We can buy some chocolate the next time we're here.
%0%a001250
	Couldn't we afford it? Well, I don't mind having a small dinner today if that helps.
Tuppence
	Don't worry, %a000090. I won't tell anyone you didn't even have enough money to buy some chocolate!
Bianca
	The lanterns look so pretty, dun't you think?
	All elegant, like.
Nera
	Those lanterns were probably made to commemorate departed slimes, don't you think?
%0%a001240
	The castle looks even prettier of a night. Maybe it's the slime lanterns that do it.
%0%a001250
	Ooh! Look at all the slime lanterns floating by.
	They look so pretty!
Sancho
	Si. The floating lanterns, they are eso b-beautiful.
Tuppence
	I say! Surely it's not the done thing to throw rubbish in the river like that!? ...Or am I missing something?
Bianca
	It dun't look like hard work to me.
Nera
	That poor old man, having to come out
	at this time of night to do that.
%0%a001240
	So he's the one who sets the lanterns afloat.
%0%a001250
	I'd like to try setting a lantern afloat one day.
Tuppence
	I'm rather worried that old man might put a foot wrong and end up being carried away himself.
	It's rather stressful for me, you know.
Bianca
	D'you reckon there really is some
	great treasure hidden here?
Bianca
	We could try askin' around and
	seein' if we get any clues.
Nera
	I don't imagine we'll be able to acquire this
	ⓗgreat treasureⓘ all that easily.
Nera
	It would be a lovely thing to add to the museum's collection. Let's see if we can find it.
%0%a001240
	So there's some kind of rare treasure hidden here? Then I'm going to find it!
%0%a001250
	I wonder what the rare treasure could be.
	How exciting!
Sancho
	Qué? A r-rare treasure?
	Thees castle, ees esmall.
	Ees gonna be a c-cinch to f-find eet.
Tuppence
	I suppose the best way to start is by talking to lots of people and seeing if we can find any clues.
Bianca
	It's almost like that bloke's not from round here.
	I s'pose it's fair enough that he dun't know, though.
Nera
	It looks like this treasure we're looking for isn't something that everyone knows about.
%0%a001240
	I wonder what that man's doing here.
	Do you think he just spends all his days
	eating chocolate medalliyums?
%0%a001250
	If he's never heard of it, maybe that means it's really old.
Tuppence
	Looks like we won't be getting any more information out of him. Let's try someone else.
Bianca
	Puzzling little thing? I wonder what it is!
Nera
	He gave it to the woman at the inn? It can't be that great a treasure if he just gave it away!
%0%a001240
	He gave it away just like that!?
	If only he'd given it to us!
%0%a001250
	I wonder what it is exactly...
Sancho
	Where ees thees rear dominium?
	But eef he has a p-pain there, thees treasure, eet must be esomething h-hard, no?
Tuppence
	I thought we had no chance of getting hold of it, what with it supposedly being so rare, but now I'm full of hope!
Bianca
	She must be talkin' about the treasure we heard about, eh, %a000090?
Bianca
	We should try and find the thing now we've trailed after it this far!
Nera
	It sounds like this treasure is really doing the rounds. I'm so curious about what it is!
%0%a001240
	So she didn't want it either? This thing is starting to sound more useless by the minute!
%0%a001250
	It sounds like they're all just passing it on because no one can find a use for it.
Sancho
	I j-just ask one time, okay? Thees ⓗspecial thingⓘ,
	ees the esame as the r-rare treasure, si?
Tuppence
	I'm afraid the value of this supposed rare treasure is starting to go down rather in my estimation.
Bianca
	He dumped it!? D'you think it's really that worthless?
Nera
	Hm. I'm not sure about going after something that's been thrown out, but I suppose we should go and find it after all this.
%0%a001240
	He threw it out!? But there's an old man out there who really wants it!
%0%a001250
	Shall we go and have a look outside and see if we can find it, Dad?
Sancho
	Ah-ha! Now we f-find out esomething important about thees thing, si? Ees esome kind of eshield!
	Qué? Ees n-no thees that ees important?
Tuppence
	A rare treasure is one that remains out of reach... I'm starting to see the point to that proverb now.
Bianca
	Crikey! Is it me or is that medal talkin'!?
Nera
	It sounds like someone's squashed underneath.
	We must help them!
%0%a001240
	Wow! It's a maxi medal! Hey! Do you think it could be the rare treasure?
%0%a001250
	Dad! He says he's being squelched!
	We have to help him. Hurry!
Sancho
	Chico! I know djou are l-looking at the medal,
	b-but djou must help thees slime now!
Tuppence
	What an enormous medal! It would be impossible to get out from under it without any help.
Bianca
	Fancy that poor slime bein' squashed like that!
Bianca
	This must be this so-called ⓗgreat treasureⓘ we've bin hearin' so much about.
Bianca
	I've gotta say, it's a bit of a let-down.
Nera
	Well. I, er, suppose we've found the
	ⓗgreat treasureⓘ then.
Nera
	Old Man Nick Knack will be thrilled with this. We must take it to him at once.
%0%a001240
	Er... So, I suppose we should be pleased, right?
	Yay...!
%0%a001250
	Phew! Thank the Goddess that poor little slime didn't get totally squashed.
Sancho
	Anda! Now even the slimes, they are t-telling us what to do!
Tuppence
	I suppose that means the museum is ours! We should hurry on over and claim our prize.
Bianca
	It is pretty solid, I suppose. Maybe it could be used as a shield, after all! I wonder...!
Nera
	I think maxi medals are quite pretty, too, personally. Papa would love to see it.
%0%a001240
	Yeah, I'd say mini medals are lots prettier.
	And they're nowhere near as heavy either!
Sancho
	No. I n-no agree. Thees maxi medal, ees muchos functional. Ees esomething I can equip myself weeth, djou see?
Bianca
	So it was in the fountain. No wonder
	Old Man Nick Knack couldn't find it.
Nera
	Ah, that must be why it has that funny smell to it, because of being in the water all that time.
%0%a001240
	So the King didn't take very good care of it.
	That's a shame.
%0%a001250
	Urgh! This maxi medal's got a bit of a nasty smell to it.
Sancho
	The cleaning, ees v-very important!
	B-But maybe thees time, we n-no need to worry, eh?
	Ees okay like thees.
Tuppence
	She found it in the fountain? Sounds like they didn't even notice it fall, then.
Bianca
	Blimey! I hope no one was too badly hurt. So much for treasure bein' good!
Nera
	Goodness! What a huge-scale treasure hunt that would have been. Papa would've loved it.
%0%a001240
	So lots of these maxi medals were sent flying around the world?
%0%a001240
	Was the game that you were supposed to dodge them when they landed or something? Oh no, it was a treasure hunt, right?
%0%a001250
	Do you think the person who started all that thought it would be fun? It sounds pretty scary to me.
Sancho
	Si. A l-long, long time ago, Gotha C-Castle, eet was d-damaged by esomething.
Sancho
	I remember esome people, they were t-talking about treasure. Maybe eet was one of the m-maxi medals!
Tuppence
	How terrifying! If one of these hit you on the head, it'd be goodnight nurse, and that's for sure!
