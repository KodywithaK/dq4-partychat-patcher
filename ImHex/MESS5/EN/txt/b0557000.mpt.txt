Bianca
	Did you know there was a cave all the way up here, %a000090?
Nera
	I had no idea there was a cave here.
%0%a001240
	I'm pretty curious to see what lies beyond this cave, aren't you?
%0%a001250
	There's a really funny atmosphere to this place.
Sancho
	Careful where you are treading,
	My Majesty.
Tuppence
	Oh! There are no monsters here! Ha ha! I was rather dreading the fact that there would be.
Bianca
	You're not the only one who becomes all the more determined to do somethin' when you're told not to, %a000090!
Nera
	No doubt you're planning on moving it regardless? You have that defiant look on your face again.
%0%a001240
	ⓗThis stone must not be movedⓘ? I wonder who would write something like that.
%0%a001250
	If it says not to move it, then we shouldn't move it. ...Right?
Sancho
	Who would put esometheeng like thees een here?
	Ees loco! I no like the feeling of thees.
Tuppence
	When you see instructions not to do something, you tend to do it anyway, right, %a000090?
Bianca
	Do you sense a kind of heavy feeling in the air all of a sudden? We should be careful, %a000090.
Nera
	Be careful, darling. There are monsters about!
%0%a001240
	That strange stone slab...
	I wonder what it actually does.
%0%a001250
	Why did you go and move it when it said not to!?
Tuppence
	Dear me. Whyever did you move that stone slab, Your Majesty? Did you have too much time on your hands or something?
Bianca
	Hey! The monsters have disappeared!
Nera
	It seems to be something to do with that stone slab.
	What a strange cave this is!
%0%a001240
	Am I just imagining it, or have all the monsters disappeared? Why would that be?
%0%a001250
	Where have all the monsters gone?
Sancho
	Eet eseems as eef the air, ees cleared.
	Are you feeling eet too, friend?
Bianca
	Weird. It's like any sign of monsters is just drifitin' away. Still, I suppose we shouldn't complain!
Bianca
	There's somethin' a bit funny about this cave.
	I wonder what the story is.
Nera
	It feels so odd being able to take our time walking through a cave like this without always looking over our shoulders.
Nera
	I wonder where all the monsters are lurking.
%0%a001240
	Am I just imagining it, or have all the monsters disappeared? Why would that be?
%0%a001240
	You can see monster footprints all over the place, but there's no sign of the monsters themselves.
%0%a001240
	If it gets much quieter, I'm going to start having trouble staying awake!
%0%a001250
	That's odd. All the monsters are gone.
	I don't see a single one of them.
%0%a001250
	Ready or not...here we come!
%0%a001250
	I think the monsters must be playing hide and seek!
%0%a001250
	Right, right, left... Um, left...right, right... Ⓠ
%0%a001250
	It's just a little ditty that %a001240 taught me. It's to help me remember how to skip nicely.
%0%a001250
	Yoohoo! Monsters!
	...Why don't you answer me?
Sancho
	You know what eet ees, My Majesty? The monsters, they are escared of you now. Because you fight like the matador!
Sancho
	Sí, ees good the monsters no bother us.
	But I... I estill worried.
Tuppence
	I say! There's something a bit odd here. There's no sign of any monsters whatsoever.
Tuppence
	I'm not very comfortable with this. I don't much like surprises. Still, at least this is a good one.
Tuppence
	Ah... (mumble mumble)...
	Oh dear! This won't do!
Tuppence
	Sorry, %a000090. Things are so quiet in here that I was almost falling asleep on the spot.
Tuppence
	Did you use holy water while I wasn't looking or something, %a000090?
Bianca
	What do you suppose is goin' on with this place?
	Why are the monsters here such pesky, persistent little things?
Bianca
	If there are this many monsters about, there must be somethin' pretty special in here that they're tryin' to stop us gettin' at.
Nera
	It's all or nothing with this cave when it comes to the number of monsters around. Rather too extreme for my liking.
Nera
	It would be nice to get ahead more quickly, but it looks like they're doing their hardest to stop us.
%0%a001240
	Be careful, Dad. The monsters in here
	are pretty scary.
%0%a001240
	This cave isn't far from Roundbeck, is it?
%0%a001240
	We'll have to tell all the townspeople to steer well clear of this place. It's far too dangerous!
%0%a001250
	Ouch! ...It's alright. I just tripped a bit, that's all.
%0%a001250
	The monsters here are really mean. It's like they're being controlled by something.
Sancho
	A brave conquistador, he knows when ees the good time to make a fresh estart.
Sancho
	You have become esuch a fine man, %a000090. I, I am eso proud! Esometimes when I am walking behind you, I forget you are no your father.
Sancho
	Today, ees been a very exhausting day. I gonna prepare for you a nice, hot bath and esometheeng esalty for dinner.
Tuppence
	Don't worry, %a000090. If the worst happens, I'll take good care of your beloved wife and children.
Tuppence
	Hmm. If only I'd brought a painter along with me.
Tuppence
	How nice it would be if I could show people at home a picture of me in a mighty fighting pose!
Tuppence
	I just can't keep up with this place. One minute there are no monsters at all, and then the whole place is overrun with them!
Bianca
	Hey! What d'you s'pose that is?
%0%a001240
	Are we done yet? Those stone slabs are really heavy. I'm tired!
%0%a001250
	Is that your robe over there, Dad?
Sancho
	Uf! Pushing these estones around these narrow passages, ees like dancing the salsa, no? Ees hard work.
Debora
	Here we are in yet another cave. You certainly know how to hunt these places out, don't you, %a000090?
Debora
	Just move it if you want to move it.
	I'm not bothered either way.
Debora
	Ah... I thought this might be the case.
	Maybe I should've said.
Debora
	That stone obviously seals away the monsters in this cave. You probably already figured that out.
Debora
	It's certainly a lot easier without monsters to worry about, but it's still a cave, and I really hate caves.
Debora
	A cave's a cave, monsters or no monsters.
	Yuck! Being in here makes me feel all clammy.
Debora
	Monsters everywhere, monsters nowhere to be seen... Are they just trying to wind me up?
Debora
	If we're done here, we're leaving right away. Got it? I'm not taking no for an answer.
Nera
	Ooh, do you see that robe over there?
	You'd look lovely in that, darling.
Debora
	Is that a robe over there? If that's why we're here, just take it and let's get out of here.
