	You currently have %a000420 token%H0420%X%Ys%Z.
	Would you like to exchange them for a prize?
*: 
	Which prize do you want?
*: 
	I'm afraid you don't have enough tokens for %a040100.
*: 
	%0%a040100, right?
*: 
	And who's the lucky recipient?
*: 
	Well, there's always room in your bag!
*: 
	But you can't carry any more items, %a000180. Shall I reorganise what you've got?
*: 
	Unfortunately, you're carrying a lot of important items, %a000180. I can't mess with them!
*: 
	Can someone else carry the goods?
*: 
	All done. I've sorted things out for you!
*: 
	You can't equip this particular item, %a000180. Do you still want it?
*: 
	Would you like to equip %M0100%Xthem%Yit%Z right away?
*: 
	I'm sure %M0100%Xthey'll%Yit'll%Z be just perfect for your needs.
~ %0%a000180 equips %a020100! ~
*: 
	Here you are, %a000180!
*: 
	I'll just place the prize in %a000180's coffin, then.
*: 
	Okay. I'll make sure the prize gets to %a000180 in the wagon, then.
*: 
	Would you like to trade in any more tokens?
*: 
	Thanks for your custom.
	Come again soon!
