	Oh. You are this %a000090 character that great bishop Ladja is speaking of.
Slon
	You must not interfere with great mastery that is Ladja! Here I will take you to your death!
Slon
	Huh huh huh! You are back again! You are stubborn like the monkey, no?
Slon
	You troubled the great Ladja with your presence before, but you are no more than merely irritation.
Slon
	You must not interfere with great mastery that is Ladja! Here I will take you to your death!
Ladja
	Wa ha ha! I was awaring that you will come when I am awaiting here long enough.
Ladja
	You are remembering me?
Ladja
	Wa ha ha! Not that I am caring if you do or do not!
Ladja
	No, all that matters now is that your strength is put to a test.
Ladja
	I see... You have grown somewhat stronger than last time we are meeting.
Ladja
	Hm? Why the surprise? Oh! You think you can truly ruin me with such performance, little one?
Ladja
	Wa ha ha! I am not such foolish that I am fighting here until you become strong enough to destroy me!
Ladja
	Nonetheless, I am realising I should have take your life at the same time I turn Pankraz to ashes.
Ladja
	It is surprising to me that you remain with the breath even after I, the great Ladja, am with you fighting.
Ladja
	I must reporting to Grandmaster Nimzo immediately.
Ladja
	But first perhaps a small recreation...

	Welcome, kin of the legendary hero.
Zenith Dragon
	While I have been living among you humans as one of your own, the delicate balance of peace has once more been disturbed.
Zenith Dragon
	The gates to Nadiria have been forced asunder, and the Grandmaster of the Underworld endeavours to ascend into the human world.
Zenith Dragon
	But in you lies hope! You alone may be able to check this wretched evil!
Zenith Dragon
	And I shall do everything in my power to assist you.

Dr Agon
	No, I suppose a thin slip of a man would be squashed like a slime by a fighting force like you.
Dr Agon
	Haaaaah... I guess I'll just have to give up on old orby...
Zenith Dragon
	Were it not for your assistance, I would have remained powerless as a human.
Zenith Dragon
	I thank you, %a000090!
*: 
	That Dr Agon was in truth the Zenith Dragon in human form, truly it did catch me unawares.
*: 
	For shame, I did doubt Him and call Him an impostor!
*: 
	At long last Zenithia is restored, and the Zenith Dragon rules once more!
*: 
	But were it not for you, none of these things would have happened. May mercy shine upon you all!
*: 
	What? The Zenith Dragon has come back to life?
*: 
	Ha-hah! It's time to fight, then!
	At last!
*: 
	It is as I expected. The Zenith Dragon had adopted the form of a human.
*: 
	How He must have toiled in order that He could be restored to His true form, and to His true home of Zenithia.
*: 
	No mountain is too high for the Zenith Dragon's mighty wings.

	used is right here.
*: 
	And if you don't want to come to a sticky end, I'd suggest you keep well away from it, got it?
*: 
	Then get out of here!
*: 
	You're very defiant for one who should be soulless. Hmph! Then you deserve what's coming!

	Oh, %a000090... How much you have grown since we last met!
*: 
	And how much I have wanted to meet with you again over all these years.
*: 
	Your father, Pankraz, was always such a serious, tedious man. More of a pawn than a king.
*: 
	Which brings me to something I need to say to you.
*: 
	Would you care to listen?
*: 
	Excellent!
*: 
	Do you hereby vow to serve under the God-King, Korol, just as I, your mother, have vowed?
*: 
	I knew you would say yes, my boy! Korol will be very pleased, very pleased indeed.

	You are right. There is no point in talking of such matters. However...
*: 
	What is it? You do not wish to hear such things?
*: 
	But you said before that you would listen. What a pity. In this way, you resemble your father.
*: 
	If you insist on going against the God-King, Korol...

*: 
	(chatter chatter)

*: 
	And I heard him say something about the legendary hero not being born as long as the statue stayed where it was!
Georgie
	Oh! I have no idea what I've been doing all this time!
Georgie
	Hey! You look exactly like that lucky statue that was at my house all those years ago!

	In all honesty, I'd like to go with %O0960%Xyou, Your Majesty%YKing %a000090%Z.
*: 
	But there are so few soldiers here at the castle now, we've got our work cut out just making sure the place is secure.
*: 
	Gotha's lost a lot of people since %O0960%Xyou went missing, Your Majesty%YKing %a000090 went missing%Z.
*: 
	My father's one of them. He left and never came back. He was a bit of a legend here in Gotha, you know. A famous craftsman.
*: 
	Actually, I hear %O0960%Xyou and your father%YKing %a000090 and the late King Pankraz%Z used to live in a place called Whealbrook.
*: 
	My father used to talk about Whealbrook. He said he wanted to visit the place because it was the home of a beautiful gemstone ore or something.
*: 
	What? You say you met a legendary jeweller who cut and polished a rough Whealbrook bluestone
	you had?
*: 
	Then...my father is alive?
*: 
	But there's no point deluding myself.
	I know he's not coming back.
	He's far too stubborn for that.
*: 
	Well two can play at that game! I'm going to stay right here and prove to the old man that I can be better than him!
*: 
	Well, well! That's King Pankraz's locket you've got there, isn't it? Made to celebrate his marriage to Queen Mada.
*: 
	They say it was his intention to commission an artist from Lofty Peak to paint a portrait of her to put inside.
*: 
	Perhaps you should carry out your father's wishes if you can, Your Majesty. I'm sure it would make him very happy.
*: 
	Well, well! That's King Pankraz's locket you've got there, isn't it? Made to celebrate his marriage to Queen Mada.
*: 
	The portrait of her inside is fantastic.
*: 
	It was done by a famous artist who once lived in Lofty Peak, I believe.
*: 
	King Pankraz had a locket that was made to commemorate his marriage to Queen Mada,
	you know. He absolutely treasured it.
*: 
	Of course, it had a picture of his beloved wife in it, but there was something else...
*: 
	It seemed to have some other special meaning to him.
*: 
	Do you really speak the truth?
	Zenithia is restored to the skies?
*: 
	Then it must be that the Dragon God too
	is resurrected...
*: 
	His almighty light shall already be penetrating the dark depths of Nadiria.
*: 
	The puissance of the Grandmaster of the Underworld shall already be enfeebled.
*: 
	Queen Mada was a Loftinian.
	That means she came from Lofty Peak.
*: 
	I heard Loftinians have the power to slurppress the evil in monsters' hearts and make them goood.
*: 
	%O0960%XYou%YKing %a000090%Z can do that too, can't %O0960%Xyou, King %a000090%Yhe%Z?
*: 
	Hooray! Queen %a001230 has returned to Gotha!
*: 
	Woof! Woof, woof, woof!
*: 
	Queen %a001230! Back after ten long years!
*: 
	It's such good news, I couldⓚⓛ Hiccup!
*: 
	This Nadiria place sounds pretty terrifying if you ask me.
*: 
	I've no idea how you'd get there, even if you were mad enough to want to go!
*: 
	Hello. I'm Tuppence. It has been my dream to be a castle guard since I was a little boy, you know.
Tuppence
	Now it's my dream to accompany the King of Gotha on a mission somewhere! You know, to see a bit of swashbuckling action and all that!
Tuppence
	%O0960%XYou were magnificent in battle, Your Majesty!%YKing %a000090 was magnificent in battle!%Z
	It was an honour to see such a fine example of military expertise.
Tuppence

Tuppence
	Oh, yes! I wanted to show you this. I found it
	among my father's things. He was a castle
	guard too, you know.
Tuppence
	It's a chess set. Apparently all the soldiers in the castle were completely hooked on it once.
Tuppence
	A former chancellor introduced it, I think.
	The pieces were made by a castle craftsman.
	He was a bit of a legend, I hear.
Tuppence
	But according to my father's last will and testament, the game's infectious. It makes people bone idle.
	So I've been thinking...
Tuppence
	Perhaps you ought to take it so there's no danger of any slacking off again in the future.
	What do you say?
Tuppence
	Excellent! Then it's yours, Your Majesty.
	With my compliments.

	Could it be that you're planning to grace one of my humble beds with your stately frame?
*: 
	What an honour! It's just a tiny little place,
	really, but I hope you'll have a comfortable
	night's sleep nonetheless.
*: 
	Good morning, Your Majesty!
	Take care as you go.
*: 
	Oh, I see... Well, I shouldn't be surprised,
	I suppose. My little inn's not really monarch material.
*: 
	I used to say I hope the world's a more peaceful place by the time my little boy grows up.
*: 
	But do you know what my little angel said to me?
*: 
	He said there's no point waiting for peace, because it might never come. We have to make
	our own peace, he said.
*: 
	I just burst into tears, I did.
Sister
	Mr Sancho told me of your intentions.
Sister
	You're planning on travelling to Nadiria to rescue your mother, aren't you?
Sister
	I believe the people of Lofty Peak know the whereabouts of the entrance to the underworld.

	Let's go, then! Let's go and make mincemeat out of all the evil monsters and villains out there!
%0%a001240
	That's why I was born.
	That's my destiny!
%0%a001240
	Hey, Dad! You can't just leave me behind!
%0%a001240
	Go and speak to that party planner lady, Patty, so I can come along with you.

	If you think it's for the best, Dad, I'll stay

%0%a001250
	But I'd really like to go with you if you don't mind.
Bianca
	I won't say a word.
Bianca
	You should do whatever you feel you have to.
Bianca
	There's just one thing I ask of you.
Bianca
	Whatever happens and wherever you go, you'll take me with you.
Bianca
	I love you, %a000090.
Bianca
	Travellin' around with you certainly takes me back, %a000090.
Bianca
	Remember that time we went ghost-bustin' as kids? And the time we went to Cataract Caves...
Bianca
	Truth is, I was terrified out of my mind most of
	the time!
Bianca
	But it was all okay because you were by my side.
Bianca
	Take me with you again, %a000090.
Nera
	I wouldn't dream of saying anything.
Nera
	You must do what you want to do, my love.
Nera
	I trust you, and I'll go with you wherever you say we must go.
Nera
	And that goes for the children too.
Nera
	I love you so much, %a000090.
Nera
	I still can't believe I was a stone statue for all
	that time.
Nera
	And you know what's strange?
Nera
	Ever since you saved me and turned me back to normal, I've had this feeling. Like I have some hidden power that I didn't notice before.
Nera
	It would make me so happy if I could help
	you, darling. If I could do something useful
	with this power.
Nera
	I mean, I've been nothing but trouble for you so far, haven't I?
Sancho
	Ah-phew... Ah-ph-phew...
	Why!? Why you leave me, señor Pankraz?
	Ah-ph-phew... Ah-ph-ph-phew...

Sancho
	I weesh I can eshow to heem how estrong and
	macho you have become.
Debora
	So I was a stone statue for ten years?
Debora
	I don't remember much about it.
	Still, it's by the by now.
Debora
	I'm much more shocked at seeing you two again.
Debora
	You've grown so big all of a sudden.
%0%a001240 & %0%a001250
	Mum!
*: 
	I'm sorry to trouble you, Your Majesty, but
	Prince Albert requests your presence.
Debora
	What are you messing around for, %a000090?
	Hurry up and get going!
%0%a001250
	Is it really true that Mum spoke even more harshly in the past?
%0%a001250
	You must've been pretty brave to agree to marry her then, Dad.
Debora
	I know you're planning on going to Nadiria to rescue your mother, %a000090.
Debora
	And that's all well and good, but you've got some nerve making a decision like that without asking me first.
Debora
	Have those ten years apart made you forget how our relationship works?
Debora
	Looks like I'll just have to stay right by your side from now on and be sure I remind you.
Debora
	If you're determined to leave me behind, then I suppose I'll just do as you say.
Debora
	But you did promise me once that you'd devote yourself to me.
Debora
	And I just don't see how you can be devoted to someone if you're not by their side.
Debora
	Plus, there's lots of lost time to make up for, what with me being stuck here. Not to mention having been a statue all those years.
Debora
	Got it? Then sort it out so that I can come along with you, okay?
*: 
	Welcome to Lofty Peak.
*: 
	This is the home of the forgotten ones.
	Those who the world no longer knows.
*: 
	It is you, the progeny of Madalena...
*: 
	So many moons it has been since last you
	visited us.
*: 
	I'm travelling around in search of a legendary key that's said to open almost any door in the world!
*: 
	According to the legend, it was once owned by a master thief by the name of M. Bezzler.
*: 
	What? You've already got it!? Wow!
*: 
	So you know the name M. Bezzler, do you?
*: 
	I heard about the thief years ago now from someone in Lodestar Harbour.
*: 
	But you've heard about him too, eh?
	Well, that's good to know.
*: 
	Let me guide you, %H0860%Xtraveller%Ytravellers%Z.
*: 
	You have come here perhaps in the hope of discovering truth and reason.
*: 
	Then it is the four Elders of Lofty Peak you seek. They will enlighten you.
*: 
	Madalena belonged to us. She was a Loftinian.
	But the strong power of magic within her was a curse. It's because of this the monsters took her.
*: 
	Oh, Madalena! Where are you now?
*: 
	Above us is the council chamber of the Elders.
*: 
	We of Lofty Peak are the chosen ones.
	Chosen by the Goddess.
*: 
	It's said that once we possessed a great power.
	The power to transcend to and from the underworld, Nadiria.
*: 
	But the Elders are the only ones of us left with any vestige of that power now.
*: 
	There was one other among us, by the name of Madalena, in whom the power was still strong.
	But alas, she is long gone.
*: 
	I was against it from the start. I didn't agree with one of our own being married to an outsider.
*: 
	How many moons ago must it be now, I wonder...
*: 
	There was another traveller who, like you, stumbled across our village. Lost, he was.
*: 
	He ended up falling in love with a young woman here, and the two of them left together.
*: 
	The young woman was called Madalena.
	And if my memory serves me correctly, the
	young man was called Pankraz.
*: 
	You wish to know how to enter Nadiria, the underworld? No, no. You must not do this.
*: 
	The gateway to Nadiria has been sealed shut for centuries now.
*: 
	I once worked as a craftsman in Gotha, you know. My skills were well-known.
*: 
	But I left Gotha to follow King Pankraz.
	Alas, the hand of evil had already...
*: 
	No! I still cannot believe it!
	I refuse to believe King Pankraz is gone!
*: 
	I cannot depart from this hope that if I wait here long enough, he will come back with Queen Madalena by his side.

*: 
	Oh! Would that be a Whealbrook bluestone you have there?
*: 
	I see. Yes, King Pankraz stayed at Whealbrook for a period, did he not?
*: 
	Would you like me to cut that stone and polish it up for you?
*: 
	Well, I can hardly refuse a request from King Pankraz's own son now, can I?
*: 
	Leave it with me, and I shall transform it into something of true beauty.
*: 
	I should have it done within a day. Perhaps
	you could stay at the inn and come back for it tomorrow?
*: 
	No? Alright. Well, talking to you has been a great pleasure nevertheless.
*: 
	Ah-phew, ah-phew...
*: 
	Hm!? Ah! It's been many moons now since I burnt the midnight oil working. My tiredness overcame me.
*: 
	I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. Here, this Whealbrook sapphire is for you.
*: 
	It would be unrivalled as an exhibit in the
	knick-knackatory, I have no doubt.
~ %0%a000120 receives a dazzling jewel! ~
~ %0%a000180 acquires a Whealbrook sapphire! ~
*: 
	King Pankraz was loved not only by his own men of Gotha, but by us craftsmen too.
*: 
	There was an artist among us ⓚⓛ now sadly deceased ⓚⓛ who pledged allegiance to King Pankraz and incurred the wrath of the Elders.
*: 
	We know of your intentions. We Elders of Lofty Peak know you wish to cross over into Nadiria.
*: 
	First you must open the gateway.
	The gateway in the Estuary Sanctuary cave.
*: 
	For many, many moons, the gateway to Nadiria in the Estuary Sanctuary has remained shut.
*: 
	There are whisperings in the air about the resurrection of the Zenith Dragon.
*: 
	If this is the truth, it explains the serene glow which bathes the world of late.
*: 
	The Grandmaster of Nadiria will not be so quick to trespass in our domain now.
*: 
	The most ancient of legends tells of mounting the three great circles in the sanctuary...
*: 
	And opening the gateway to Nadiria itself!
*: 
	This room was Madalena's.
*: 
	Something she used to say has remained firmly in my memory...
*: 
	She used to say that if light was in your heart, you could never be consumed by darkness.
*: 
	Here. I do not know if this will be of any use to you, but I am sure she would have liked you to have this book.
~ %0%a000120 receives an intricately embroidered book. ~
~ %0%a000180 acquires ⓗLofty Liltsⓘ. ~
*: 
	It is a book of psalms. We of Lofty Peak read from it from an early age. Good luck. May the Goddess protect you.
