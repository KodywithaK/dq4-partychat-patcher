Chancellor
	I understand your anxiety, Your Majesty, truly I do.
Chancellor
	But might I suggest that you take a seat and try to relax?
Pankraz
	Hmph. I suppose so.
Sancho
	Señor! King Pankraz!
	Ees a bebé!
	A beautiful leettle bebé!
Pankraz
	Oh my! Bless the Goddess!
*: 
	Congratulations, King Pankraz.
*: 
	You have a beautiful baby boy, Your Majesty!
Pankraz
	Excellent.
Mada
	Darling...
Pankraz
	You did wonderfully, my dear.
	Just listen to him crying away, strong as an ox!
Pankraz
	A child with this much character deserves to be named right away.
Pankraz
	Now, let's see...
Pankraz
	I know! Why don't we call him %a001200?
Mada
	What a lovely name!
	It makes him sound so heroic and wise.
Mada
	I had another idea of my own, though.
Mada
	I was thinking it might be nice to call him %a000090.
Pankraz
	%0%a000090... I'm not sure.
Pankraz
	It sounds a little feminine for a boy's name.
Pankraz
	But if that's the name you want, then that's the name he'll have!
Pankraz
	Dear son of ours, bestowed upon us by the grace of the benevolent Goddess!
Pankraz
	From this day forth, you shall be known as %a000090!
Mada
	Oh, Pankraz!
	You really areⓚⓛ
Mada
	Gugh!
	(cough cough)
Pankraz
	Goodness! What is it?
	Are you alright, my dear?
Pankraz
	Ah, %a000090, you're awake!
Pankraz
	Hm? A dream, you say? Of being in some kind of castle when you were a baby?
Pankraz
	Ha ha ha! Don't talk such nonsense, sleepy head!
Pankraz
	Why don't you have a little stroll about outside and blow the cobwebs away, eh?
Pankraz
	I'll be in here.
	You go off and enjoy yourself.
*: 
	What is it, laddie? If it's the Captain you're after, he's in the cabin there.
*: 
	What are you doing here?
	Not heading for the deluxe suite, I hope.
*: 
	I doubt Mr Briscoletti would be best pleased if you went rummaging through his belongings while
	he was away.
*: 
	We'll be docking at Littlehaven before long. Not that there's much there to get excited about, mind you.
*: 
	The Captain's cabin is in there. You mustn't just go wandering in and out as you please, do you hear?
*: 
	If you want to go to the galley or the sailors' quarters, take the stairs just there and then go down the steps at the rear of the ship.
*: 
	I'm Cap'n Blithe, an' I'm the master of this ship, so I am!
Cap'n Blithe
	Your father was a big help to me many a time in the past, you know.
Cap'n Blithe
	The ship actually belongs to a chap called Rodrigo Briscoletti. It doesn't often carry regular passengers.
Cap'n Blithe
	This is a special voyage laid on just for your father.
Cap'n Blithe
	You make sure you do what he says, won't you, boy? You'll grow up to be a great man if you do.
Cap'n Blithe
	Your father was a big help to me many a time in the past, you know.
Cap'n Blithe
	You make sure you do what he says, won't you, boy? You'll grow up to be a great man if you do.
*: 
	I hear that you and your father are travelling around together, just the two of you. That's nice.
*: 
	Graaargh!
*: 
	Hey! You didn't scream or nuffin'!
	Bit of an 'ard nut, are ya?
*: 
	Hello there, laddie!
	Feeling a bit peckish, are we?
*: 
	The food here's not bad, even if I do say so myself. I wonder who's the better cook, me or
	your pa?
*: 
	So your father's travelling the world looking for something, eh?
*: 
	Well, I don't know what it is he's after, but I hope he manages to find it soon.
*: 
	When I think of Pankraz raising a small boy like you without your mother around...
*: 
	He's more of a man than I am, that's for sure.
*: 
	We've made port, boys!
*: 
	Cast anchor!
	Lower the sails!
Cap'n Blithe
	It looks like we've arrived.
Cap'n Blithe
	You couldn't go down below and give your father a shout, could you, boy?
*: 
	Take care, laddie!
*: 
	Just remember this, eh? Boys should never be screamin' or cryin', no matter wot.
*: 
	You look after that father of yours, laddie.
*: 
	If only I could own a big ship like
	the Black Jack here.
*: 
	I don't know why I'm telling you that, though.
	Like you could be of any help! Just ignore me.
*: 
	We're off to another port after this one, so this is where we'll bid you farewell.
*: 
	We seem to have arrived.
	And on time, thankfully.
*: 
	Hm? Who's that standing at the port? Oh yes!
	I suppose this is the first time you and Pankraz
	will have met him.
*: 
	That's the owner of the ship, Rodrigo Briscoletti. He's due to come aboard here and sail home.
*: 
	I hear that you and your father are travelling around together, just the two of you. That's nice.
*: 
	The Captain says the owner of this ship has had to do his fair share of travelling himself to go and meet his daughter.
*: 
	You're off, are you, laddie? Don't miss us too much now, will you? Keep a smile on your face, eh!
Pankraz
	So we've docked at last!
Pankraz
	It must be two years now since we were last home at the village.
Pankraz
	You were so small when we left, %a000090, that I doubt you remember it very well at all.
Pankraz
	Right then. Ready for the off?
Pankraz
	Make sure you haven't left anything behind,
	won't you, son?
Cap'n Blithe
	It looks like it's time for us to bid each other
	farewell then, boy. Spare me a thought every
	once in a while, eh?
Pankraz
	We'll be disembarking in a minute, %a000090.
Pankraz
	Who's that there waiting to get on the ship, Captain?
Cap'n Blithe
	Ah! Mr Briscoletti!
	I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
Mr Briscoletti
	Ah, travellers, I see.
	I must apologise for my daughter's behaviour.
Mr Briscoletti
	And here's the maestro of the vessel!
Cap'n Blithe
	Good to see you again, Mr Briscoletti.
	Judging by the look on your face,
	I'd say you've had an enjoyable trip!
Mr Briscoletti
	A smile shows a man is eating well!
	Now, allow me to introduce my daughters...
Mr Briscoletti
	Nera, come here to papa.
Mr Briscoletti
	Oh, my poor bambina!
	Is the step too high for you?
Pankraz
	Allow me to give you a hand, my dear.
Nera
	Thank you, sir.
Mr Briscoletti
	A traveller with manners. Good, good!
Mr Briscoletti
	Now, Nera. We've travelled further than a long piece of linguine. You must be exhausted.
Mr Briscoletti
	Be a good man and take Nera to my suite so she can get some rest, hm?
*: 
	Right away, sir!
Mr Briscoletti
	My apologies for holding you up, sir.
	Please, terra firma awaits you!
*: 
	Dear me!
	I totally forgot to get everything clean and tidy!
Nera
	Who are you?
	Oh! You're travelling around with your father?
Nera
	That's funny. I'm here with my father too.
	And my sister.
Nera
	I'm a little bit scared of the sea.
	It's just so big.
Mr Briscoletti
	I'm sorry for delaying you, young man.
	Take care on your travels, now.
Cap'n Blithe
	Ha ha ha! I don't think I've ever seen Mr Briscoletti look so happy!
Cap'n Blithe
	Anyway, it looks like it's time for us to bid each other farewell now, boy. Spare me a thought every once in a while, eh?
*: 
	Mr Briscoletti may be rich, but it doesn't mean he's forgotten the important things in life.
	He's a good man, you know.
*: 
	His daughters will probably grow up to be the happiest girls in all the world.
Pankraz
	Are you sure you've got everything, %a000090?
	You've checked inside the drawers as well?
Pankraz
	Then it looks like our voyage is at an end.
	Are you ready to disembark?
Pankraz
	Well, Captain! Thanks again for everything.
	Have a safe onward journey!
*: 
	Hey! It's Pankraz, isn't it?
*: 
	I thought so!
	So you made it back safely, did you?
Pankraz
	Ha ha ha! I may starve and I may go thirsty,
	but nothing can finish off old Pankraz!
Pankraz
	Now then, %a000090. I have some business to
	do with this gentleman, so why don't you run along and play?
Pankraz
	Oh, and while I think of it, I want you to have this.
~ Pankraz hands the adventurer's map to %a000090. ~
~ %0%a000090 receives the adventurer's map. ~
Pankraz
	That's a very important map.
	An old friend of mine made it for me long ago.
Pankraz
	Make sure you take good care of it and don't lose it.
Pankraz
	And don't go off playing too far away.
Pankraz
	Feeling a bit sad to leave, are you?
	Why don't you go and say your goodbyes to everyone? I'll wait for you here.
Pankraz
	Off you go. I'll be right here.
*: 
	Goodness me!
	You're Pankraz's little lad, aren't you?
*: 
	You've grown an awful lot since the day you left.
Pankraz
	Now then, %a000090. I have some business to
	do with this gentleman, so why don't you run along and play?
Pankraz
	And don't go off playing too far away.
Pankraz
	Took your time, didn't you?
	Are you about ready to leave now then?
*: 
	It must be two years now since that chap Pankraz set off from here on his travels.
*: 
	He said he was going off in search of something important. Took his little boy with him too.
	I wonder what became of them.
*: 
	No! You're the little boy?
	And Pankraz just arrived back on that ship?
*: 
	You shouldn't go about spreading silly rumours, you know, boy!
~ Pankraz comes to the rescue! ~
~ Pankraz joins the battle! ~
Pankraz
	Are you alright, %a000090?
~ Pankraz casts Heal. ~
Pankraz
	It's too dangerous for you to wander off too far on your own. You must be more careful in future.
Pankraz
	Now then, shall we get going?
Pankraz
	Are you alright, %a000090?
~ Pankraz casts Heal. ~
Pankraz
	It's too dangerous for you to wander off too far on your own. You must be more careful in future.
Pankraz
	Now then, shall we get going?
*: 
	You're in my way, old man!
Mr Briscoletti
	Or should I say daughter? One of them has rudely gone on ahead.
*: 
	Look, this isn't an open house, you know. You can't just wander around like you own the place. That's my job.
*: 
	This is my room, got it?
	So you'd better leave, don't you think?
~ %0%a000090's wounds are healed! ~
~ %0%a000090's wounds are healed! ~
*: 
	Goodness me! If it isn't old Pankraz!
	Wherever have you been these past two years?
*: 
	Never mind that. It's good to see you back,
	and that's all that matters.
*: 
	I mustn't just stand here chattin' away,
	though. I need to tell everyone the good
	news that you're back!
*: 
	Attention everyone!
	Pankraz has returned!
*: 
	There you are, Pankraz!
	So you're still alive!
*: 
	My, oh my! That can't be that little lad of yours, surely? Hasn't he grown!
*: 
	Anyway, why don't you pop in for a drink at my pub one night, eh, Pankraz?
*: 
	I'm sure the regulars would love to hear a few tales about your adventures.
*: 
	You're back, Pankraz!
	Good to see ya, mate!
*: 
	I know we didn't always see eye to eye,
	but I've bin missin' seein' you around.
*: 
	Come by when things 'ave calmed down a bit and we'll settle old scores, eh?
*: 
	So it's true! You really are back, Pankraz! Welcome home!
*: 
	The village was full of gossip about you while you were away, I can tell you!
*: 
	Ah, Mr Pankraz, sir.
	How wonderful it is to see you lookin' so well.
*: 
	Praise the Goddess for deliverin' you home to us safe and sound! Glory be to the Goddess!
*: 
	I beg your pardon.
	I seem to have got rather carried away.
*: 
	But you're home! You're home! Pankraz is home!
	I'm so happy! H-A-P-P-Y! Happy!
Sancho
	Señor! You have returned!
	Ees eso good to esee you!
Sancho
	I have been waiting for you weeth
	bated breath.
Sancho
	Come! Come eenside, señor.
*: 
	Welcome home, Mr Pankraz!
Pankraz
	???
Pankraz
	And who might this girl be?
*: 
	That's my daughter!
Pankraz
	Oh yes! I know you! You're old Whitey's wife from the village nearby, aren't you?
Sancho
	Sí, Mrs Whitaker, eshe came here from Roundbeck to get the medicine for señor Whitaker, her husband.
*: 
	Grown up talk is borin'.
	Shall we go upstairs and play?
*: 
	Come on!
*: 
	I'm Bianca. Do you remember me?
Bianca
	I wonder...
Bianca
	I'm eight, which means I'm two years older than
	you are.
Bianca
	I know! Why don't I read you a story?
	Hang on a minute...
Bianca
	Okay, here we are!
Bianca
	Erm... One......hm......up......oh! Upon! No...
Bianca
	Oh, this is too hard! How am I supposed to read something this difficult?
Mrs Whitaker
	Bianca! It's time we returned to the inn, dear!
Bianca
	Comin', Mum!
Bianca
	I don't blame you.
	You were only tiny back then, after all.
Sancho
	You are estarting to look just like your madre, %a000090.
Sancho
	Mada, eshe was esuch a kind and beautiful señora. I, I... (sniff)
Sancho
	I expect you are tired after esuch a long day, eh?
Sancho
	Then ees time you went to bed.
	Buenas noches, friend.
Sancho
	Okay, friend. But when you feeling esleepy,
	you come and tell your Uncle Sancho, sí?
Pankraz
	Well, then. I'm going out for a little while.
	You stay here and make sure you behave, alright?
*: 
	Brrrrr. I'm f-f-f-f-freezing! It's supposed to be s-s-summer before long. I don't g-g-get why it's
	so c-c-cold.
*: 
	Alright, kid? You know, just hangin' on to weapons and armour isn't enough.
*: 
	No, you have to equip them properly before you can use them, you see.
*: 
	So if you come across anythin' useful-lookin' in a cave or wherever, make sure you don't forget to equip it, eh?
*: 
	Meow.
*: 
	This is the church. If you go inside and confess, you can have them keep a log of your adventures for you.
*: 
	This is Whealbrook. If you head west from here, you come to the town of Roundbeck.
*: 
	My poor plants are really sufferin' here with this cold. I'm at my wits' end, I am.
*: 
	My poor plants are really sufferin' here with this cold. I'm at my wits' end, I am.
*: 
	Hey! Where did you get that stone, boy?
	Find it at the bottom of the well, did you?
*: 
	I went huntin' about in the cave back in my younger days, lookin' for some of them famous Whealbrook bluestones.
*: 
	Ah, yes. I remember pokin' about them big
	rocks hopin' for a sign of some ore.
	It doesn't half take me back.
*: 
	My poor plants are really sufferin' here with this cold. I'm at my wits' end, I am.
*: 
	It's extremely dangerous outside of the village. You be a good boy now and go back home where you'll be nice and safe.
*: 
	You're a good child, aren't you, boy?
	Then make sure you don't get in the way of that father of yours.
*: 
	This here's the cave entrance, you know, boy. Don't expect me to come in after you if you get yourself lost.
*: 
	Ah, you've come to.
*: 
	I did what I could for you, but you really should go home and get some rest now.
*: 
	I hear your poor mother was taken away by the angels when you were still a little baby.
*: 
	But you mustn't let that make you lose heart.
	You have such a wonderfully strong father there to support you, after all.
*: 
	I wonder what it could be that Pankraz is
	lookin' for. Why would he make such long
	and dangerous journeys?
*: 
	I often wonder what sort of life Pankraz led before he came here to Whealbrook.
*: 
	He doesn't seem to want to talk about it much,
	but I'd wager he was no ordinary man.
	You mark my words!
*: 
	You were just a little baby when you and your father came here to live in Whealbrook.
*: 
	I can hardly believe how the time's flown by.
*: 
	You're Pankraz's son, aren't you?
*: 
	It must be a good five years now since Pankraz turned up here in Whealbrook.
*: 
	He's a real grafter, your father.
	Folk here took to him the moment he arrived.
Mrs Whitaker
	That man I sent lookin' for herbs still ain't back yet.
Mrs Whitaker
	I wish I could send somebody in after him to see he's alright and everythin'.
Mrs Whitaker
	But your father seems so busy at the minute.
Mrs Whitaker
	And I doubt there's anyone else who'd be willin' to go traipsin' into the depths of the cave for me.
Mrs Whitaker
	There's still no sign of that man I sent lookin' for herbs. I'm startin' to get a bit worried now.
Mrs Whitaker
	Dearie me! You went into the cave and saved a chap out from under a big rock?
Mrs Whitaker
	Good heavens! That must be my man!
Mrs Whitaker
	Well, thanks ever so much, boy! That means I'll probably get my medicine by tomorrow mornin'.
Bianca
	We live in the town west of here.
	It's called Roundbeck.
Bianca
	Your dad used to bring you over to my house to play lots when you were little.
*: 
	Look what we have here!
	My youngest customer yet, I'd say!
*: 
	This is the pub, laddie. You might be gettin' a little bit ahead of your years, don't you think?
*: 
	I can't help but worry, you know. It's my
	old dad. He went off lookin' for herbs and
	hasn't come back.
*: 
	He probably went searchin' for them in the cave here, Whealbrook Adit. I hope he's alright.
*: 
	My old dad finally came back with those herbs he was after.
*: 
	He'll be gettin' to work on makin' the medicine now.
	I should think he'll probably have it done and dusted by mornin'.
Mr Rockefeller
	Ah! You're the young laddie from the cave, aren't you, boy? You really helped me out of a tight spot back there.
Mr Rockefeller
	In fact, I'd say you deserve a reward!
	Have a look in that drawer just there.
Pankraz
	Ah, you're awake, %a000090.
Pankraz
	Mrs Whitaker has got the medicine she came for now, so she and Bianca will be going home today.
Pankraz
	I'm a bit worried about them travelling
	on their own, though.
Pankraz
	I was thinking I might see them back to Roundbeck safely. Do you want to come along?
Pankraz
	Good, good. Let's be off then, shall we?
Sancho
	Adiós, señor Pankraz.
	No get een no trouble, eh!
*: 
	Not leaving us already, are you, Pankraz?
Pankraz
	Just a short trip to Roundbeck, my man, that's all!
*: 
	I see. Well, have a safe journey!
Pankraz
	Oh, don't be like that! I'm taking you along anyway. I'm sure you'll enjoy it in the end!
~ It looks like it might be some kind of warning sign. ~
~ But %a000090 hasn't learnt how to read yet! ~
*: 
	Ah-phew, ah-phew...
*: 
	Yikes! I'm such a fool! I got bored not being able to move and ended up fallin' asleep!
*: 
	I was just walkin' along mindin' my own business when this huge rock came tumblin' down on me, y'see.
*: 
	I don't suppose I could trouble you to give it a shove, could I, boy? It won't take much to get me free.
~ %0%a000090 investigates the large rock. It looks quite heavy, but it might just be possible to get it moving. ~

*: 
	Nice work, boy! I'm lucky you come along.
	The name's Rockefeller, by the way.
	Pleased to meet you!
Mr Rockefeller
	Now I can get that medicine to Mrs Whitaker like she asked.
Mr Rockefeller
	Oops! There's no time for idle chit-chat.
	I'd better get back and start mixin' these herbs.
~ %0%a000090 gives up on pushing the rock. ~

*: 
	Pankraz! What a delight it be to see your face again!
Pankraz
	Er, likewise, my man!
*: 
	You're back, Mrs Whitaker! Did you manage to get hold of some medicine?
*: 
	Well, that's good news, en't it? Mr Whitaker'll be right as rain in no time.
Pankraz
	Where is old Whitey, then? I'd like to pop my head around the door if that's okay.
*: 
	I hope Mr Whitaker is back on his feet soon.
Bianca
	My dad's ill, y'know.
Pankraz
	If you're feeling bored, why don't you go for a bit of a walk?
Mrs Whitaker
	Why dun't you go off for a little walk with my Bianca?
Mrs Whitaker
	Dun't you go off too far on your own, will you, Bianca?
Bianca
	No, Mum!
Mr Whitaker
	Uurgh! (cough cough)
	...I'd keep your distance, laddie. I dun't want you catchin' what I've got.
Bianca
	D'you want to go for a walk?
	I'll go with you if you like.
*: 
	Long, long ago, a mighty count and a beautiful countess lived over at Uptaten Towers.
*: 
	But they were unable to have children, and the place was left deserted and empty after their deaths.
*: 
	And yet, night after night, sounds of crying can still be heard coming from within the castle walls.
*: 
	The end! What d'you reckon to that, son? Pretty scary stuff, eh!?
*: 
	I'd steer well clear of Uptaten Towers if
	I was you.
*: 
	I'm travelling the world collecting unusual tableware and the like.
*: 
	I heard that Count Uptaten used to drink tea from something called a ⓗtoff's tea setⓘ. Made of silver, it was.
*: 
	This here's Roundbeck. If you head north from here, you come to Uptaten Towers.
*: 
	Not you again! You young hooligans will be the death of me!
*: 
	Oh, wait a minute! You're not one of the usual little ruffians I have in here.
*: 
	But you're still gettin' in my way!
	Go on, away with you!
*: 
	I stand guard here all day and all night makin' sure that no monsters go comin' into town.
*: 
	You're a spirited-lookin' young thing, you are. Don't you go thinkin' about wanderin' off outside of town, d'you hear?
*: 
	Oi! What d'you want? Can't you see we're busy teasin' this stupid cat!? Get lost!
*: 
	It's a pretty weird cat, en't it? Its purr's really funny.
*: 
	Go on! Purr again, puss!
Bianca
	Leave him alone, poor thing!
	Give him to me!
*: 
	You want him, do you?
*: 
	Okay. I'm bored of teasin' him now. If you want him, you can have him.
*: 
	Hah! But only after you've gone and defeated the ghosts at Uptaten Towers!
*: 
	Yep! That's the deal! You defeat the ghosts, and then you get the cat!
*: 
	The cat's yours as soon as you defeat those ghosts over at Uptaten Towers.
*: 
	If you want the cat, you'd better get on over to Uptaten Towers and start thinkin' about fightin' ghosts!
*: 
	Grrrr!
*: 
	Ah, what a diligent young thing you are, comin' along to the church by yourself.
*: 
	You remind me of me when I was your age.
	Ha ha ha!
*: 
	Hello there, boy! Come for a booze with your girlfriend, have ya!? Ha ha ha!
*: 
	She's not bad neither! She'll be a right looker in a few years' time!
~ The door seems to be locked from the other side, and it won't open. ~
*: 
	That young rascal of mine has gone and got himself a cat.
*: 
	I keep tellin' him we can't possibly keep a cat here, but he won't listen. He's a worry sometimes, that boy!
Pankraz
	You've been a while, %a000090. The good news is that old Whitey just has some sort of cold or other.
Pankraz
	I suppose we'd better start thinking about making tracks for Whealbrook.
Mrs Whitaker
	You can't possibly be thinkin' of leavin' now, Pankraz!
Mrs Whitaker
	You should stay one night here at the very least.
Pankraz
	Well, I suppose you've talked me into it!
Mrs Whitaker
	Oh, good! Let me show you to your room.
Mrs Whitaker
	Here you go, Pankraz.
	You have a good night's sleep, eh?
Pankraz
	Right. Well, we'd better be on our way early in the morning. Otherwise the folk back in Whealbrook will be wonderin' where we've got to.
Pankraz
	We should make sure we get plenty of rest. Goodnight, %a000090.
*: 
	Psst! %0%a000090!
	Wake up!
Bianca
	Good. You're awake, %a000090.
Bianca
	Come on, let's hurry!
Bianca
	What d'you mean, where to!?
	To Uptaten Towers, of course!
Bianca
	We have to give them ghosts the what-for so we can save that poor cat from any more bullyin'.
Bianca
	All we have to do is keep headin' north, and we should come to the place eventually.
Bianca
	Let's go!
Bianca
	Good. You're awake, %a000090.
Bianca
	Uptaten Towers is just to the north of here.
	You know the way.
Bianca
	Come on! Let's get goin'!
Pankraz
	Zzzz...
Pankraz
	Mada... My dear Mada...
	Our boy %a000090 is growing into a fine lad... Zzzz...
*: 
	Long, long ago, a mighty count and a beautiful countess lived over at Uptaten Towers.
*: 
	But they were unable to have children, and the place was left deserted and empty after their deaths.
*: 
	And yet, night after night, sounds of crying can still be heard coming from within the castle walls.
*: 
	The end! What d'you reckon to that, son? Pretty scary stuff, eh!?
*: 
	I'd steer well clear of Uptaten Towers if
	I was you.
Mrs Whitaker
	Ah-phew...
Mr Whitaker
	Ah-phew, ah-phew... Aaaah-CHOO!
	Zzzz...
Bianca
	Here we are, home sweet home.
Bianca
	(yawn) I'm tired.
	Maybe we should give it a rest for tonight.
Bianca
	We'll try again tomorrow, eh, %a000090?
	'Night!
Bianca
	Phew! Here we are, back safe and sound.
Bianca
	Are you alright now, %a000090?
	I think we'd better leave it at that for tonight.
Bianca
	We'll try again tomorrow, eh?
	'Night!
*: 
	Waaargh! Help! Help!
*: 
	Oh! You're not ghosts!?
	You gave me quite a scare there!
*: 
	Oi! You, monster! Get out of our town!
	Zzzz...
*: 
	You've got quite a nerve, comin' into a pub bein' a young thing like you!
*: 
	You remind me of me when I was your age.
	Ha ha ha!
*: 
	Dear, oh dear. Kids of your age shouldn't be out and about playin' at this time of night!
*: 
	Hello! Would you like a glass of milk, perhaps? Tee hee hee!
*: 
	You know, you really shouldn't come here again until you're a bit older, alright?
*: 
	Mmm... You can't beat a good dose of the old juice in a nice-looking cup. It makes all the difference.
*: 
	Not that you'd know that yet, though.
	Eh, young'un? Ha ha ha!
*: 
	Awright, sonny! Everythin' goin' okay, is it?
	Nice! Hic!
~ It's locked from the inside because it's night-time. ~
Pankraz
	Aaaah-choo! Ah-choo!
	Urgh! My head hurts.
Pankraz
	Looks like I must've caught old Whitey's cold.
	Of all the things!
Mrs Whitaker
	I'm afraid it looks like your dad's gone and caught my old man's cold.
Mrs Whitaker
	You'll have to both stay here until he feels better again.
Bianca
	We're goin' again tonight, right?
	Maybe we should get some sleep.
Bianca
	You have a rest now, okay?
	I'll come and get you when it's time.
Bianca
	Yeah, we should probably stock up on a few things durin' the daytime.
Bianca
	Let me know when you get sleepy, though, eh?
*: 
	Welcome to the travellers' inn!
*: 
	Oh, it's you, boy. Hopefully your dad'll be well again before long, eh?
Mr Whitaker
	The last thing we want is for you to catch this wretched cold too, boy. Off with you to the other room, eh?
*: 
	Oi! What d'you want? Can't you see we're busy teasin' this stupid cat!? Get lost!
*: 
	If you want the cat, you'd better get on over to Uptaten Towers and start thinkin' about fightin' ghosts!
*: 
	You on your own today, kiddo?
*: 
	What happened to that cute little girlfriend of yours you brought here the other day? You don't wanna lose that one!
~ %3News of how %a000090 and Bianca defeated the ghosts at Uptaten Towers quickly spread through the town that night.%4 ~
~ %3Then morning came...%4 ~
Bianca
	A promise is a promise!
	So hurry up and give us that cat!
*: 
	I dunno...
*: 
	I s'pose we don't have much choice.
*: 
	Fine. You did what you said you'd do, after all. Take the stupid cat!
Bianca
	Yay! That's good news, en't it, cat?
	No more bullyin' for you!
Bianca
	Come on! Let's get goin'!
*: 
	You're pretty brave...I s'pose.
*: 
	I didn't think you'd actually go through with it and go off huntin' ghosts like that!
Bianca
	I know!
Bianca
	We should give the puss a name!
Bianca
	Hmm... What d'you think to callin' it Saber?
Bianca
	%0%a001210's alright by you, is it?
Bianca
	Nice! %0%a001210 it is then!
~ %0%a001210 joins the party! ~
Bianca
	Come on! Just pick a name!
Bianca
	No? Hmm... Leo could work.
Bianca
	Then how about Spot?
Bianca
	Or Mohicat?
Bianca
	There's always Tom!
Bianca
	Then how about Purrcy?
Bianca
	Or just Moggy?
Bianca
	We could call it Punk!
Bianca
	Pyjamas is quite funny...
Bianca
	I know! What about Baumren?
*: 
	You may be heroes now you've gone and fought those ghosts, but it dun't mean I'm lettin' you out of town alone!
*: 
	Who knows what kind of dangerous monsters might be lyin' in wait!?
*: 
	Are you the ones who fought them ghosts?
	That's pretty impressive for a couple of kids!
*: 
	The wailin' I used to hear comin' from Uptaten Towers every night suddenly stopped last night.
*: 
	You've done us a big favour there, kids.
Mrs Whitaker
	I can't believe the two of you went off fightin' those ghosts all by yourselves.
Mrs Whitaker
	I know it went well this time, but you mustn't go off again at night doin' such dangerous things. D'you hear me, Bianca?
Mr Whitaker
	You're the town hero, boy! It's easy to see how you take after your father, bein' brave enough to do that!
Pankraz
	You're a worry sometimes, %a000090.
	But at least you're safe.
	And my cold's all better now too.
Pankraz
	We should be getting back to Whealbrook.
	Have you said all your goodbyes yet?
Pankraz
	Now then, shall we get going?
Pankraz
	Thanks for everything, Whitey!
Pankraz
	Off you go, then.
	I'll wait for you here.
Bianca
	%0%a000090!
Bianca
	Looks like we probably won't be seein' each other for a while. Here, have this.
~ %0%a000090 receives Bianca's ribbon. ~
Bianca
	I know! I'll tie it to %a001210!
Bianca
	Hopefully we'll have another adventure together sometime, eh, %a000090?
Bianca
	See you!
Pankraz
	By the way, %a000090...
Pankraz
	I have to tell you I was quite impressed by how you took on those ghosts.
Pankraz
	But you're still just a young boy. You mustn't put yourself in such danger again, okay?
Pankraz
	Right... Time to make a move.
Pankraz
	Think you're invincible now then, do you?
	Never mind. Come on, let's make a move.
~ %0%a001210 joins the fray! ~
*: 
	Oh! You're takin' that cat off our hands, are you? Well, that's a relief!
*: 
	You're brave beyond your years, goin' off fightin' ghosts like that!
*: 
	You remind me of me when I was your age.
	Ha ha ha!
*: 
	I heard what you did, kids!
	That's amazin'!
*: 
	You should've seen all the kerfuffle last night when people found out what you'd been up to!
Bianca
	Oh yeah. I suppose I should've mentioned that my mum's allergic to pets...
Bianca
	That means you'll have to be the one who takes care of %a001210. You dun't mind, do you, %a000090?
Bianca
	Come on! Let's get goin'!
