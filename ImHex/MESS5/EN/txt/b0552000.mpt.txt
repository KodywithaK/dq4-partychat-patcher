Bianca
	That was Briscoletti, wasn't it?
	He looked a bit serious, though, eh?
Bianca
	I wonder what's goin' on.
	We'd better go and find out.
Nera
	Papa must be really troubled to have not even noticed us just then. I'm worried about him.
	We'd better find out what's happened.
%0%a001240
	What do you reckon is going on here?
	He seemed a bit on edge, didn't he?
Sancho
	Qué? You, you know thees señor, friend?
Sancho
	He no eseems to be een a good mood, eh?
	Maybe you eshould ask heem what ees the matter.
Sancho
	Qué? Thees señor, he ees señora %a001230's papá?
Sancho
	He no eseems to be een a good mood, eh?
	Maybe you eshould ask heem what ees the matter.
%0%a001240
	La Guardia! That's the lookout tower, isn't it?
	Can we all go together?
Bianca
	I never dreamt we'd be walkin' about here
	together again.
Bianca
	...Maybe I'm jumpin' the gun a bit bein' so
	happy, though.
%0%a001240
	We never came here with Sancho when we were looking for you, Dad.
%0%a001250
	Really? This is the town where you and Mum got married? How exciting!
Sancho
	Ees a very attractive town, you no theenk?
	Sí. Gotha eshould look like thees.
Tuppence
	No!? You had your wedding ceremony here?
Tuppence
	Oh, I see. You didn't realise your true status at
	the time.
%0%a001240
	This is where Mum was born, isn't it?
	Oh! She wasn't actually born here?
%0%a001240
	So she travelled around a bit as a kid too, then.
%0%a001250
	I really like this town.
	I bet Mum loves it here too.
Sancho
	Ees a very attractive town, you no theenk?
	Sí. Gotha eshould look like thees.
%0%a001240
	Mostroferrato. I'll have to remember that.
%0%a001240
	It's where Mum's from, after all.
%0%a001240
	It would be a bit weird, seeing a jar glowing red all by itself like that.
%0%a001250
	Is there nothing we can do to help out, Dad?
Sancho
	Thees ees red, thees ees white... Thees conversation, ees chopping thees way and that more than the barber eshop! Eh heh heh heh.
Sancho
	Anda! Ees no time for the laughing, eh?
Tuppence
	Sometimes ignorance is bliss.
Tuppence
	But it's no use burying your head in the sand when something needs to be dealt with.
%0%a001240
	We'd better go and see if we can help out, Dad. That's what friends are for.
Sancho
	You know why he can no forget you, friend?
	Ees because you are a good and
	honest man!
Tuppence
	Fancy saying he looks terrible! That fellow was hardly doing too well in the looks department himself.
Tuppence
	Oh, I see. He meant this Briscoletti's in a bad way emotionally, did he? Silly me!
%0%a001240
	Dogs are really cool. Can I have a dog when we get back home to Gotha? Please, Dad!
%0%a001250
	I really like dogs. They never lie to you, for one thing.
%0%a001240
	It's all pretty sizeable here, isn't it?
%0%a001240
	I feel sort of grown up when I come into a pub
	like this.
%0%a001250
	Pubs always have a bit of a nasty smell to them.
	Is it the stuff people are drinking?
%0%a001250
	Urrrrgh! He's disgusting!
	Let's get out of here, Dad!
Bianca
	Charmin'!
%0%a001240
	Is that man drinking to make himself sick?
	Why would anyone want to do that?
Sancho
	Ees no right to eat hairs from a dog!
	You no know where the dog has been.
Bianca
	It can't be much fun havin' to open up all day and entertain the likes of him.
%0%a001240
	I wonder why there's no atmosphere in the daytime. That's weird.
Tuppence
	Bunny girls are always so lovely, even when their tails are bit out of joint.
%0%a001240
	Do you think coming here makes Mr Briscoletti
	feel better?
Sancho
	You know, your Uncle Sancho espent a lot of time een the pub too, when señor Pankraz, he, he no came home.
%0%a001240
	Ha ha! Do you think we really do look alike? I hope so.
%0%a001250
	Don't I look more like Mum?
	Oh... That's a shame.
Sancho
	Hmm... Thees old señora, eshe was there at your wedding, friend?
Sancho
	I weesh I had been there too.
	I am eso, eso jealous!
%0%a001240
	You know so many people, Dad!
Tuppence
	It seems the people here have no idea you're the great King of Gotha.
%0%a001250
	Wow! What a lovely big church!
%0%a001250
	I bet Mum looked beautiful when she got
	married here.
%0%a001240
	Marriage... That's still a long, long, long way off
	for me!
Tuppence
	Aah, I wonder where the beauty is who I'm destined to marry.
Bianca
	I s'pose I could take the odd bit of bein' bossed around by you every now and then, %a000090.
Bianca
	I'd rather that than be married to a man who's a
	wet blanket!
Nera
	I don't think it's really necessary to treat one another like that. I'm perfectly happy as we are.
%0%a001240
	Ha! That's so cool!
%0%a001250
	People like that are mean. You won't start acting like that, will you, Dad?
Sancho
	No one knows a man better than hees wife.
Sancho
	These two, they must be very happy together.
Bianca
	Nera seems even prettier than ever, eh?
Bianca
	Huh! Not that now's the time to start gettin' bogged down with things like that, mind.
%0%a001240
	They sound like they really need our help, Dad.
%0%a001250
	So she's Nera? She's really pretty, isn't she?
Tuppence
	Goodness! That wife of Crispin's is a
	tremendous beauty.
Tuppence
	I probably shouldn't say this, but...
	If someone like him can get someone
	like her, then there's hope for me yet!
Nera
	I would never have expected Crispin to fall for a woman like that!
Nera
	If Papa needs help, then of course we'll go to him, won't we, darling? We don't need to be asked twice.
%0%a001240
	They sound like they really need our help, Dad.
%0%a001250
	What a funny outfit she was wearing just for being around the house! Maybe her husband likes her looking like that.
Tuppence
	That wife of Crispin's is burning hot!
Tuppence
	I probably shouldn't say this, but...
	If someone like him can get someone
	like her, then there's hope for me yet!
Nera
	The cheek of it!
%0%a001240
	What's wrong, Dad?
	How come you've gone all red?
%0%a001250
	I don't think you should look at Ashlee like that, Dad. Mum might get jealous.
Tuppence
	Hmph! Why is it that the women only ever have eyes for you?
%0%a001250
	What a huge house! It's almost like a castle.
%0%a001240
	We're going to help these people out, right, Dad?
	Count me in!
Sancho
	Anda! Eef ees esometheeng thees señor, he can no tell to hees wife, maybe ees a very beeg problem, no?
%0%a001240
	So this is sort of like another home for you,
	then, Dad?
%0%a001240
	We're going to help these people out, right, Dad?
	Count me in!
%0%a001250
	I don't look anything like Grandma, do I?
	Maybe I do take after you, then, Dad.
Sancho
	Anda! Eef ees esometheeng thees señor, he can no tell to hees wife, maybe ees a very beeg problem, no?
%0%a001240
	I wonder what sort of monster it is. It must be pretty nasty for Mr Briscoletti to be so wound
	up about it.
Sancho
	You no wanna know more about thees
	old diary?
Sancho
	Maybe ees wrong to read eet before you ask permission, but ees no the time for manners now.
Bianca
	ⓗTo those of my heirs unlucky enough to be born one hundred and fifty years after myselfⓘ...?
Bianca
	Sounds like we're the unlucky ones, eh?
Nera
	I can't believe Papa kept such a big secret to himself all this time.
%0%a001240
	A monster so big that his head reached the clouds? Do you think that's really possible?
%0%a001250
	It must be an enormous jar if it's got a monster that big inside.
Sancho
	I no comprende everytheeng, but I understand enough. Come, we must go.
Tuppence
	A b-beast so gigantic, his head p-pierced
	the clouds?
Tuppence
	P-Perhaps it would be better if I sat this one out back in Gotha.
%0%a001250
	Is your heart made of stone, Dad? Really?
Bianca
	Now's not the time to be teasin' the poor bloke, %a000090! We owe him this at least.
Bianca
	He's the one who put on our lovely weddin', remember! And he gave us that great big ship and everythin'!
Sancho
	How could you be eso cruel? Your father,
	he would turn over hees grave eef he esaw
	thees, friend.
Bianca
	I en't really sure what this is all about, but we should just do what he says.
%0%a001240
	So all we have to do is find out what colour the jar is? That'll be dead easy!
%0%a001250
	If he's that worried about it, why doesn't he go and see for himself?
Sancho
	Ees no joke to ask esuch a theeng of esomeone else.
Sancho
	I believe thees señor Briscoletti, he ees too escared to esee eet for heemself, no?
Tuppence
	This is the perfect opportunity. Briscoletti will be in my debt and...
Tuppence
	Er! Nothing! No, I didn't say a word.
	You must be hearing things.
Nera
	We haven't seen each other for years, and yet he barely gave me a second glance.
Nera
	And he's still so pushy and heavy-handed.
	Sorry about all this, darling.
%0%a001240
	So all we have to do is find out what colour the jar is? That'll be dead easy!
%0%a001240
	Is that man my grandad?
%0%a001240
	I wonder if I'll go bald when I'm older too.
%0%a001250
	If he's that worried about it, why doesn't he go and see for himself?
Sancho
	Ees no joke to ask esuch a theeng of esomeone else.
Sancho
	I believe thees señor Briscoletti, he ees too escared to esee eet for heemself, no?
Tuppence
	This is the perfect opportunity. Briscoletti will be in my debt and...
Tuppence
	Er! Nothing! No, I didn't say a word.
	You must be hearing things.
Bianca
	(yawn) Aaaaaah. ...There's no need to stare at me when I'm yawnin', you know!
Nera
	By the time you take into account all the travelling I did and that time I spent at the abbey, I wasn't actually here all that much.
Nera
	It's still nice to be back, though.
%0%a001240
	I can hear lots of people having fun.
	Maybe they're in the pub?
%0%a001250
	Um, it's night already, isn't it?
Sancho
	Ees a very attractive town, you no theenk?
	Sí. Gotha eshould look like thees.
%0%a001240
	Huh! I suppose he thinks he's funny, does he?
%0%a001250
	That's really scary. Can we hurry up and find an inn now please, Dad?
Sancho
	Sí. Ees true. Een the night, the monsters, they
	come out to play. Maybe ees a good time for
	a siesta, no?
%0%a001240
	That dog sounds weird.
	Maybe it's got a cold or something.
%0%a001240
	(yawn) I think I might be a bit sleepy.
%0%a001240
	It would be a bit weird, seeing a jar glowing red all by itself like that.
%0%a001250
	Is there nothing we can do to help out, Dad?
Sancho
	Thees ees red, thees ees white... Thees conversation, ees chopping thees way and that more than the barber eshop! Eh heh heh heh.
Sancho
	Anda! Ees no time for the laughing, eh?
Tuppence
	Sometimes ignorance is bliss.
Tuppence
	But it's no use burying your head in the sand when something needs to be dealt with.
%0%a001240
	The pub's a bit lively. You have to talk really loud to make yourself heard!
%0%a001250
	Yuck! All those smells are making me feel sick.
%0%a001240
	I'd like a tasty glass of juice, I think!
Tuppence
	Hee hee hee! What a cheeky little minx!
Bianca
	I wonder what she'd say if I tried to take her up on her offer.
%0%a001240
	Do you think coming here makes Mr Briscoletti
	feel better?
Sancho
	You know, your Uncle Sancho espent a lot of time een the pub too, when señor Pankraz, he, he no came home.
Bianca
	It's not so lucky havin' to put up with the likes of him though, eh? What a lout!
Bianca
	Well, that told you, eh, %a000090?
Sancho
	Sí, sí. Thees ees the truth, you know.
%0%a001240
	Does that mean the colour of it's changed
	just recently?
%0%a001240
	I never let the bad stuff get me down in the dumps. It's best to stand up and do something about it.
%0%a001250
	We probably shouldn't really just wander around people's houses when they're sleeping. They might think we're burglars.
%0%a001240
	We shouldn't wake him up, Dad. Let him sleep.
Sancho
	The old señores and señoras, they like to esleep early. You must no wake them up, friend.
Bianca
	It's nice that she looks out for her hubbie like
	that, eh?
Nera
	We should probably have a good rest together tonight too, darling.
Sancho
	You see? Ees notheeng better than esomeone who loves you.
Bianca
	Briscoletti seems pleased, eh? It's good that we've managed to pay him back a bit.
%0%a001240
	Oh! We could've fought with Briscoletti if he'd made it to the tower in time. That would've been fun.
%0%a001250
	I think that's the first time I've seen Mr Briscoletti smile. He's like a totally different person.
Sancho
	Thees ees no the end of our quest.
	Come, we have muchos, muchos to do.
Tuppence
	Aah, another heroic tale to add to my
	ever-growing portfolio!
Bianca
	That was interestin', eh?
	We should bear it in mind.
%0%a001240
	She thinks you learn from me, Dad. That must make me your teacher, then! Ha ha!
%0%a001250
	Um, I think you're already a really good dad.
	You don't have anything to learn.
Bianca
	Briscoletti's always worried about the townsfolk, and they're worried about him.
Bianca
	It's nice that they all care about one another so much, eh?
%0%a001240
	It doesn't look like the people here noticed that huge monster on the prowl. I suppose that's for the best.
Tuppence
	Hmph. What a pity the people here weren't able to witness my bravery!
Bianca
	Sounds like she's pretty grateful to us, eh?
%0%a001240
	This house is huge. Does that mean Mr Briscoletti's really rich?
%0%a001240
	Oh! We could've fought with Briscoletti if he'd made it to the tower in time. That would've been fun.
%0%a001250
	I think that's the first time I've seen Grandpapa smile. He's like a totally different person.
Sancho
	Thees ees no the end of our quest.
	Come, we have muchos, muchos to do.
Tuppence
	Aah, another heroic tale to add to my
	ever-growing portfolio!
Nera
	Papa certainly seems to be in a good mood.
Nera
	It's been a long time since I've seen him laughing like that. Thank you, darling.
%0%a001240
	Oh! We could've fought with Briscoletti if he'd made it to the tower in time. That would've been fun.
%0%a001250
	I think that's the first time I've seen Grandpapa smile. He's like a totally different person.
Sancho
	Thees ees no the end of our quest.
	Come, we have muchos, muchos to do.
Tuppence
	Aah, another heroic tale to add to my
	ever-growing portfolio!
%0%a001240
	Yay! We got some pocket money!
	Can we split it between %a001250 and me?
%0%a001250
	There's nothing I want to buy at the moment, so you can just save my share, Dad.
Nera
	Mama seems so thrilled to see %a001240 and %a001250.
Nera
	I feel quite emotional all of a sudden.
%0%a001240
	Grandmama's so kind and gentle.
%0%a001240
	I'm going to try really hard to keep everyone safe.
%0%a001250
	I don't think it's a shame at all. It's nice that we can all spend time together.
Nera
	I still sometimes wonder why someone as young as %a001240 has to be the legendary hero.
Nera
	I hope this is all over soon so that we can go home and give him some semblance of a normal childhood.
Sancho
	Where I come from, we esay the young ones, they follow een the footsteps of their parents. You weell be a fine papá, friend.
Tuppence
	Well, well... I never imagined such a delightful-looking lady could possibly be a grandma already.
Nera
	You are quite wonderful, you know, darling. You seem so much stronger now than when you were turned into a statue.
%0%a001240
	It doesn't look like the people here noticed that huge monster on the prowl. I suppose that's for the best.
Tuppence
	Hmph. What a pity the people here weren't able to witness my bravery!
%0%a001240
	If it's your house, then that makes it my house too, right? Yippee!
%0%a001250
	He he! A wonderful son-in-law? It's funny to hear someone talk about you like that.
%0%a001240
	Looks like there's nothing to worry about here
	any more.
%0%a001250
	He does have quite a laugh on him!
Sancho
	You know, eef thees señor, he had no told us about the colour of the jar, maybe we would have been too late, no?
Sancho
	He ees like a warrior from the eshadows, no?
	The sombrero saviour! Qué? Thees no translate?
%0%a001240
	It sounds like that man's been to see the jar loads of times. That's nice of him.
%0%a001240
	Huh! He's a bit dippy, isn't he?
%0%a001250
	It's weird that that man didn't think to check what the noise was about. %0%a001240 would've definitely gone and had a look.
Bianca
	It's nice that he cares more about Briscoletti's welfare than he does about his own business, eh?
Tuppence
	Mr Briscoletti's a very wealthy man, though.
	I should imagine he consumed a fair few pints
	of this man's stock.
%0%a001240
	One hundred and fifty years would've felt like just a few days? Do you think time feels different if you're big, then?
%0%a001250
	Would everyone have been killed if that monster
	had made it into town? It's a good job we stopped him, then.
Bianca
	No doubt you'll treasure the fact that Nera's prayin' for you, eh, %a000090?
Bianca
	What!? No, I didn't mean anythin' funny by it!
	I was bein' serious!
%0%a001240
	Yeah, let's get on our way now, Dad.
	We're done here.
Tuppence
	With a beauty like that praying for me, I suddenly feel like I have the strength of a hundred men!
Tuppence
	What a shame she already belongs to another, though. Will the Goddess never grant me the happiness I deserve?
%0%a001240
	One hundred and fifty years would've felt like just a few days? Do you think time feels different if you're big, then?
%0%a001250
	Would everyone have been killed if that monster
	had made it into town? It's a good job we stopped him, then.
Nera
	DARLING! I'd be grateful if you could avert your eyes from that...lady.
%0%a001240
	What's wrong, Dad?
	How come you've gone all red?
%0%a001250
	I don't think you should look at Ashlee like that, Dad. Mum might get jealous.
Tuppence
	Hmph! Why is it that the women only ever have eyes for you?
%0%a001240
	He's having a good sleep. Probably because he's got nothing to worry about any more.
%0%a001240
	The monster's supposed to have been a secret!
	I wonder how he found out.
%0%a001250
	Red does tend to signify danger, I suppose.
	I wonder how much that man knows exactly.
Bianca
	It is pretty late now, I s'pose.
%0%a001240
	Does that mean everyone's asleep?
	But you want to look around anyway?
Sancho
	You no comprende? Thees señorita, eshe ees too polite to esay, but we are no welcome een the house because everyone, they are esleeping.
%0%a001240
	Are we staying here tonight?
	Can I sleep in Mum's bed? Yay!
%0%a001250
	I'm really tired now. I don't care where I sleep as long as I can sleep soon.
%0%a001240
	He looks like he's having a nice sleep. I hope we can get off to bed soon too.
%0%a001250
	I have to brush my teeth before I go to bed. Otherwise Sancho will tell me off.
Nera
	It feels funny watching Mama and Papa when they're asleep like this.
Sancho
	You must no wake up the señora!
	No. Ees time for us to esleep too.
%0%a001240
	Hey! Aren't we sleeping here tonight?
	I want to sleep here!
%0%a001250
	It smells of Mum in here. If I slept in that bed,
	I'd probably end up crying or something.
%0%a001240
	It's cool that we could all stay together like this.
%0%a001250
	I'm going to try really, really hard today!
%0%a001240
	Oh! Aren't we going to stay? But I'm still only little really. I wanted to sleep in Mum's bed.
%0%a001250
	You might still have lots of energy, Dad, but I'm really tired.
Tuppence
	Don't you worry about me. You should take all the rest you need.
Tuppence
	I can sleep on the edge of the bed.
	Or the floor, even!
Debora
	I wonder what's got Papa in so much of a flap.
Debora
	We should probably try and find out.
Debora
	You'd never dare speak to me like that, would you, %a000090? Not even by mistake!
Debora
	Oh dear. Papa really is a luckless man at times.
Tuppence
	So this is Debora's hometown, is it?
Tuppence
	That reminds me, Debora has a sister, doesn't she?
	I can't wait to meet her!
Debora
	This place looks just the same as ever.
Debora
	I wonder how Nera is.
Debora
	Wasn't he having a hair of the dog when we saw him ten years ago too?
Debora
	Huh! Some people never learn.
Debora
	Then why don't they just not bother opening up during the day?
Debora
	Papa comes here a lot? That's odd. This kind of place never used to be his cup of tea.
Debora
	So Nera married Crispin in the end.
Debora
	He's a bit of a no-hoper, but as long as she's happy, I wish her well.
%0%a001240
	Mr Briscoletti is sort of your dad, isn't he, Dad?
%0%a001240
	We should make sure we help him then!
%0%a001250
	So she's Nera? She's really pretty, isn't she?
%0%a001250
	She's Mum's younger sister, isn't she?
	That must make her my aunt then.
Tuppence
	Goodness! That wife of Crispin's is a
	tremendous beauty.
Tuppence
	Er, I mean! I didn't realise she was Debora's little sister. She's very, um, kind-looking!
Debora
	I see Papa's still as overbearing as ever.
Debora
	There's no arguing with him once he gets like this. You'll just have to go and do what he says, %a000090.
%0%a001240
	So all we have to do is find out what colour the jar is? That'll be dead easy!
%0%a001240
	Is that man my grandad?
%0%a001240
	I wonder if I'll go bald when I'm older too.
%0%a001250
	If he's that worried about it, why doesn't he go and see for himself?
Sancho
	Ees no joke to ask esuch a theeng of esomeone else.
Sancho
	I believe thees señor Briscoletti, he ees too escared to esee eet for heemself, no?
Tuppence
	This is the perfect opportunity. Briscoletti will be in my debt and...
Tuppence
	Er! Nothing! No, I didn't say a word.
	You must be hearing things.
Bianca
	Debora's just the same as ever, eh?
	It's quite nice to see she en't changed, though.
%0%a001240
	Is that woman your friend, Dad?
%0%a001240
	I think she's probably the strangest one I've met
	so far.
%0%a001250
	Dad... That lady's a bit scary.
Tuppence
	You know this person, %a000090? Well I never!
Tuppence
	She's still single, isn't she?
	You absolutely must introduce us!
Nera
	Debora's just the same as ever.
Nera
	Mama and Papa must be really worried about her still not being married yet.
%0%a001240
	Is that woman Mum's big sister?
%0%a001240
	Then that must make her my aunt!
%0%a001250
	That woman looks quite similar to Mum, but her personality seems completely different.
Tuppence
	So, %a000090! It seems this is the lovely Nera's older sister.
Tuppence
	Ha ha! You do realise that if she and I end up
	getting married, that would make you and I brothers-in-law?
Tuppence
	I'll have to do my utmost to see if I can win
	her heart!
Bianca
	I know she's pretty and all that, but...
	You dun't really feel anythin' for her, though,
	do you?
Nera
	I can't believe she'd think such a thing of you!
Nera
	She's not right, is she?
	Am I not the woman for you?
%0%a001240
	That's not true, is it, Dad?
	You're glad you chose Mum, right?
Tuppence
	It may be too late for you, but perhaps I'm still in with a chance!
Bianca
	Maybe Debora's still a bit sore that you picked
	me, eh?
Nera
	I'm afraid that Debora may still be a little hurt that you picked me over her, darling.
Debora
	It's so much quieter here at night than it is during
	the day.
Debora
	Papa comes here a lot? That's odd. This kind of place never used to be his cup of tea.
Debora
	What? You're not expecting the same kind of treatment from me, are you?
Debora
	Ooh, that's quite a windfall!
	Let's go shopping, %a000090!
Debora
	Of course I'd rather that the children weren't involved in our battles.
Debora
	It's what they want to do, though.
	It's important to respect that.
Debora
	That goes without saying. I wouldn't have married you otherwise.
%0%a001240
	Oh! We could've fought with Briscoletti if he'd made it to the tower in time. That would've been fun.
%0%a001250
	I think that's the first time I've seen Grandpapa smile. He's like a totally different person.
Sancho
	Thees ees no the end of our quest.
	Come, we have muchos, muchos to do.
Tuppence
	Aah, another heroic tale to add to my
	ever-growing portfolio!
Debora
	I suspect Papa never intended to fight in the
	first place.
Debora
	Still, it's probably for the best. He would only have got in the way if he'd made it anyway.
%0%a001240
	Oh! We could've fought with Briscoletti if he'd made it to the tower in time. That would've been fun.
%0%a001250
	I think that's the first time I've seen Grandpapa smile. He's like a totally different person.
Sancho
	Thees ees no the end of our quest.
	Come, we have muchos, muchos to do.
Tuppence
	Aah, another heroic tale to add to my
	ever-growing portfolio!
Bianca
	She wasn't bothered? This Debora's quite a piece of work, eh?
Nera
	I think she's probably just trying to save
	our feelings.
%0%a001240
	How can she not have been bothered, with that huge monster clomping about the place?
	She must be really brave!
%0%a001250
	She's not expressing it very well, but I'm sure she's just trying to be considerate of our feelings.
Tuppence
	Dear Debora, I came as fast as I could to check that you weren't injuⓚⓛ Oh. She's not listening.
Nera
	Debora always calls people puny-looking when she's trying to pay a compliment. She's just teasing.
Nera
	I'm glad that the children seem to get on with her.
%0%a001240
	What's the problem with calling her ⓗauntieⓘ, Dad?
	She is my auntie, isn't she?
%0%a001250
	I'm too scared to call her ⓗauntieⓘ.
	I'll just call her ⓗSignorinaⓘ like she asked.
Tuppence
	Ooh, I don't mind calling her ⓗbeautiful Signorina Deboraⓘ! No, not one little bit!
Debora
	I suppose that means Crispin's my brother-in-law now that he and Nera are married.
Debora
	That should make him even easier to boss around than before!
%0%a001240
	One hundred and fifty years would've felt like just a few days? Do you think time feels different if you're big, then?
%0%a001250
	Would everyone have been killed if that monster
	had made it into town? It's a good job we stopped him, then.
%0%a001240
	Her sister is Mum, isn't it?
%0%a001240
	Aren't sisters supposed to be alike?
	They don't seem very similar.
%0%a001250
	Auntie Nera really seems to care about Mum, doesn't she? You can tell she'd love to see her again.
Tuppence
	With a beauty like that praying for me, I suddenly feel like I have the strength of a hundred men!
Tuppence
	What a shame she already belongs to another, though. Will the Goddess never grant me the happiness I deserve?
Debora
	We were turned into stone for all those years,
	so the time didn't pass that quickly for us!
%0%a001240
	I knew I looked like you, Dad!
	Everyone says so.
%0%a001250
	Nera and Mum are sisters, aren't they?
%0%a001250
	I wonder if they fight with each other sometimes like %a001240 and I do.
Debora
	Mama, Papa, Nera, they're all the same.
	Non-stop worriers, the lot of them!
Debora
	You seem incredibly pleased that Nera's been praying for you...
%0%a001240
	Yeah, let's get on our way now, Dad.
	We're done here.
Tuppence
	With a beauty like that praying for me, I suddenly feel like I have the strength of a hundred men!
Tuppence
	What a shame she already belongs to another, though. Will the Goddess never grant me the happiness I deserve?
Debora
	Watching Mama sleeping like that makes me feel all sleepy too.
%0%a001240
	Hey! Aren't we sleeping here tonight?
	I want to sleep here!
%0%a001250
	It smells of Mum in here. If I slept in that bed,
	I'd probably end up crying or something.
%0%a001240
	It's cool that we could all stay together like this.
%0%a001250
	I'm going to try really, really hard today!
%0%a001240
	Oh! Aren't we going to stay? But I'm still only little really. I wanted to sleep in Mum's bed.
%0%a001250
	You might still have lots of energy, Dad, but I'm really tired.
Tuppence
	Don't you worry about me. You should take all the rest you need.
Tuppence
	I can sleep on the edge of the bed.
	Or the floor, even!
Debora
	You'll be lucky, Tuppence! It's your turn to stand outside the room on guard all night, remember?
Tuppence
	Of, of course. Yes.
Nera
	Aah, it's good to be back. This place never changes.
Nera
	I wonder how Debora's getting along.
Tuppence
	So this is Nera's hometown, is it?
Tuppence
	That reminds me, Nera has a sister, doesn't she?
	I can't wait to meet her!
