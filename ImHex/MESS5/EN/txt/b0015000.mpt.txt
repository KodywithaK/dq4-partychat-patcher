*: 
	Ah-ha! You must be Miss %a001230's husband.
*: 
	And there you are too, %a001230.
*: 
	Excellent. I was sent out by Mr Briscoletti on a bit of a mission, you see.
*: 
	Huuurgh-up!
*: 
	To give you this. There, I've done it now.
	Goodbye!
*: 
	Heh heh heh. What have we here?
	Lost your way, have you?
*: 
	Dear, oh dear! Perhaps you'd like to stay here the night, then?
*: 
	You just have a good rest.
	I'll be upstairs if you need me. Heh heh heh.
*: 
	No? I see. Well, safe travels, then.
	Heh heh heh.
Bianca
	Hey, %a000090!
	Do you hear that noise?
Bianca
	It sounds just like a knife bein' sharpened!
Bianca
	I think it's comin' from upstairs.
	Can you go and have a look?
Bianca
	Be careful, eh!
Bianca
	Yeah, you're probably right.
	I'm sure it's nothin' to worry about.
Nera
	Wake up, %a000090!
	I can hear a funny noise.
Nera
	It sounds almost like a knife being sharpened!
	I think it's coming from upstairs.
Nera
	It's making me feel rather frightened. If it's not too much trouble, would you go up and have a look?
Nera
	Be careful, won't you?
Nera
	Of course. I'm sure you're right. As long as you're by my side, I have nothing to worry about.

	I didn't realise Gotha was so far out of the way.
Debora
	So you're a bit of a country bumpkin then, are you, %a000090? Suddenly everything becomes clear! Ha ha!
Debora
	Hey, you! What are you doing asleep?
	Wake up! Wake up, I tell you!
Debora
	Oh... Are you awake?
Debora
	Can you hear that? Of course you can!
	It sounds a bit like a knife being sharpened...
Debora
	You'd better go and have a look.
Debora
	If there's something weird going on, you head whoever it is off while I get away, okay?
Debora
	Don't be such a coward!
	Huh! Once a wimp, always a wimp.
*: 
	Oh dear! Is everything alright? That lady friend of yours there is looking a bit off-colour.
Bianca
	It's nothin'. I'm fine.
Bianca
	I just feel a bit...
Bianca
	Woo㈢ooozy...
Nera
	I'm alright, really. Just a bit tired.
Nera
	There's no need for concern.

	I'll ㈢be ㈢fiⓚⓛ
*: 
	Oh no!
*: 
	We must get her to bed immediately!
	She can come to our inn.
*: 
	I say! There's a woman fainted here!
	Somebody come and give us a hand!
Priest
	Hmm. She doesn't seem to have a fever.
	It seems to just be a case of exhaustion.
Priest
	She should rest here for today at least.
Priest
	Now, if you'll excuse me.
*: 
	Thank the Goddess there's nothing serious wrong with the poor thing!
*: 
	Oh! She's your wife, is she?
	She's certainly a beauty!
*: 
	You should take good care of that one.
	Don't wear her out so much in future.
Bianca
	Sorry for makin' you worry like that, %a000090.
Bianca
	I feel fine now. Although I am still a bit sleepy...
Bianca
	I think ㈢I might just have ㈢a little bit more of a ㈢rest. 'Night, %a000090.
Bianca
	Mornin', %a000090!
	I feel right as rain again now!
Bianca
	How couldn't I? I'm so excited about finally bein' so close to your hometown!
Bianca
	Come on, then!
Nera
	Sorry for giving you such a fright, darling.
Nera
	I feel much better now. Just a little bit sleepy, that's all.
Nera
	If you ㈢don't mind, I'll just ㈢sleep a little longer.
	㈢Goodnight, darling.
Nera
	Good morning! Sorry again about yesterday.
Nera
	I really do feel back to normal again now.
Nera
	It won't be long before we reach your homeland.
	How exciting!
Nera
	Off we go!
*: 
	Oh good! I'm ever so glad to see you looking better.
*: 
	There's no need to thank me. I just did what any good person would do. Ha ha ha!
*: 
	I came here with my husband too. It's hard work climbing all the way up here, that's for sure.
*: 
	It's good to see you better, dear.
*: 
	This is the village of Battenberg.
	We have snow here all year round.
*: 
	It never used to be anywhere near as hard
	to get here in the past, before all the monsters came along.
*: 
	Have you been across the bridge yet?
*: 
	Then you must've got a view from there of
	the castle.
*: 
	That's the Kingdom of Gotha.
	Pretty impressive, isn't it?
*: 
	If you cross the bridge and descend down through the cave, you'll eventually come to the Kingdom of Gotha.
*: 
	Uh-oh! I'm in a lot of trouble now. I broke the compass that my granny made for me.
*: 
	She'll probably give me a right earful for this!
	Oh! I don't want to go home and face her!
*: 
	Meow.
*: 
	This little boy will be the death of me.
	He won't eat a bite.
*: 
	And after all the effort I went to, making
	a soup to disguise the carrots he says he hates so much!
*: 
	Come on now! If you don't eat it all up, you'll be kidnapped by monsters just like the poor Queen of Gotha!
*: 
	Urgh. I hate carrots!
*: 
	It's not easy for a woman living up in the mountains like this.
*: 
	Maybe that's why the menfolk here are so good to us all! Ha ha!
*: 
	You're married, aren't you? You can tell straight off. You really suit each other.
*: 
	Living in the mountains isn't easy on
	a woman, but I reckon your wife would be
	just fine.
*: 
	She's the sort who'd go anywhere for the man she loved, right?
*: 
	Then you'd better not take her for granted.
	Take good care of her, won't you?
*: 
	You're married, aren't you?
	Marriage can be a tricky old business.
*: 
	Your life can change unbelievably depending on who you decide to tie the knot with.
*: 
	I suppose the strong person in the relationship doesn't feel it quite so much, though.
*: 
	It's the weaker one of the two who tends to find they experience the odd doubt or worry every now and then.
*: 
	You should make sure you take good care of your wife, anyway.
*: 
	Tsk, tsk, tsk!
*: 
	Fancy losing a precious Batten binnacle!
	I despair sometimes.
*: 
	Hm? Oh, you're the fool who pushed his wife to the point of collapse, aren't you?
*: 
	I suppose you lost your way in the mountains and wore her out, eh? You'd better have this.
~ %0%a000120 receives a Batten binnacle! ~

*: 
	Tsk, tsk, tsk!
*: 
	Fancy losing a precious Batten binnacle!
	I despair sometimes.
*: 
	The King of Gotha set out to rescue his wife years ago now, but there's been no sign of either of them since.
*: 
	It's hard to see a bright future for Gotha with its rulers missing for so long.
*: 
	The King of Gotha was a man named Pankraz. He was an incredible man.
*: 
	I remember him visiting our village not long after he took to the throne.
*: 
	He stood on the bridge outside and looked off at Gotha Castle in the distance. What a sight!
*: 
	I came here to buy a Batten binnacle, but they're all sold out at the moment.
*: 
	They're handmade, you see, so they can't make big batches of them. If I order one now, the earliest I'll get it is in a year's time!
*: 
	Hey! Isn't that a Batten binnacle you've got there!?
*: 
	You lucky thing! You'll really find it comes in handy when you need to navigate your way through caves and the like.
*: 
	Queen Mada of Gotha apparently had some kind of power to communicate with the underworld, Nadiria.
*: 
	I don't know exactly what kind of power it was, but there was certainly something unusual about the way she'd look at you.
*: 
	When she fixed her eyes on you, it was like your whole mind and body could instantly relax.
*: 
	That's funny! I'm getting the same kind of feeling from you...
*: 
	I say! What's this all about!?
Debora
	How rude! My complexion is always the colour of a beautiful rose.
Debora
	Wait... I feel a bit dizzy.
	Everythingⓚⓛ
Debora
	Everything's spinning round and round and round...
Debora
	Have you been there all this time, %a000090?
	My heart melts...
Debora
	Ha! As if! I'm sure you just couldn't bear to be away from my exquisite beauty.
Debora
	In fact, that's probably what distracted you and stopped you from catching me when I fainted.
Debora
	That's why I still feel so rough. I think I'll ㈢㈢sleep a bit longer, okay?
Debora
	I'm awake now, %a000090. And there you are, looking as wimpish as ever.
Debora
	I had a dream, you know. Of being a doting wife who wakes her husband up with a beaming smile.
Debora
	Ha! More like a nightmare, if you ask me.
	I know you prefer me just the way I am.
Debora
	We'd better get going on to your hometown.
	I'm looking forward to seeing just how rough it is.
Debora
	Come on, then, %a000090!
	What are you waiting for?
*: 
	You're married, aren't you?
	I could tell the minute I laid eyes on you.
*: 
	You look so happy, Miss, being with a man who takes good care of you.
*: 
	And you seem to be the kind of man who'd be loving and understanding even if his beloved was having a selfish moment.
*: 
	You've obviously got a good thing going between you, so make sure you nurture it and you're sure to live happily ever after.
*: 
	Thank the Goddess you bumped into me before going any further!
*: 
	I'd turn back if I were you. It's far too dangerous in here.
*: 
	I've been livin' here in these mountains
	for nigh on one hundred years now, I'll have
	you know.
*: 
	Now, I come across this T 'n' T ticket
	just over there and I was wonderin' if it
	might be yours.
*: 
	I'd best be givin' it you back then.
~ %0%a000120 receives a T 'n' T ticket! ~

*: 
	I've been livin' here in these mountains
	for nigh on one hundred years now, I'll have
	you know.
*: 
	Folk seem to be gettin' more and more dishonest nowadays. It's a sad and sorry trend.
*: 
	I wonder if that man made it safely to where he was going or not.
*: 
	It was a while back now, but a man called Sancho passed through here on his way to Gotha.
*: 
	He seemed so sad and at a loss that he really struck a chord with me.

*: 
	Then I must ask you to go away.
*: 
	This is the King's chamber.
	But His Majesty is resting at the moment.
*: 
	I must ask you to come back at another time.

	Mistress Gertrude doesn't listen to a word I say!
Gertrude
	I never asked to be a princess.
Gertrude
	It's only because my father's become King of Gotha. It doesn't matter what I think. I don't have any say in it!
Gertrude
	It's not fair.
	I just want to play.
*: 
	I remember all those long days I stood here, waiting for King Pankraz to return.
*: 
	Then finally one day, I spotted Mr Sancho approaching the castle.
*: 
	I can't tell you how happy I was to see him!
*: 
	But however many times and however hard I looked, King Pankraz wasn't with him.
*: 
	I can't tell you how sad I was not to see him!
*: 
	Welcome to Gotha!
*: 
	This is the castle town of Gotha.
*: 
	Our old king, King Pankraz, was a very sharp ruler, you see.
*: 
	That's why he decided that all Gothans
	should live within the castle walls, to protect
	us from our enemies.
*: 
	Arf! Arf, arf!
*: 
	We had a long spell here without a king at all.
	He was away travelling, you see.
*: 
	We were all waiting for him to return, but...
	Well, he never did in the end.
*: 
	Now his brother, Prince Albert, is our new king.
	He took the throne quite a few years ago now.
*: 
	There was once a master craftsman who lived here in the castle, you know. Known as a god among jewellers, he was.
*: 
	But after King Pankraz left the castle, he left too.
*: 
	His son still lives here, though.
	He runs the weapon shop upstairs.
*: 
	When I grow up, I'm going to be a soldier, and I'm going to guard Gotha to the end!
*: 
	My dad's a soldier. Soldiers are cool!
*: 
	I hope the world's a more peaceful place by the time my little boy grows up.
*: 
	That's another day Mr Sancho hasn't been in. I wonder what's happened.
*: 
	He used to come to church to pray every single day.
*: 
	Mr Sancho's getting on a bit now, I suppose...

*: 
	King Pankraz dead?
	Pah! I don't believe a word of it!
*: 
	Every time I shut my eyes I see his valiant figure standing proud and tall. So how can he possibly be gone, hm?
*: 
	I was more of a fan of King Pankraz than his brother Albert, to be honest.
*: 
	King Pankraz had vision. He had dreams!
*: 
	Sadly, now we'll never know what those dreams were. But he had them, and that's what counts!
*: 
	You are %H0860%Xa traveller%Ytravellers%Z, I believe. I too roamed the world prior to my arrival here in Gotha.
*: 
	King Pankraz was most kind and helpful.
*: 
	But were it not for the fate befallen unto Madalena, I have no doubt King Pankraz would
	still be...
*: 
	No. I have said too much. Such vain wishes shall not bring him back.
*: 
	Don't beat me to a pulp! I'm gooey enough as it is.
	And I'm not a bad slime, you know! Really! I promise!
*: 
	It's a long time agoo now, but I uoozed to be Queen Mada's pet slime once.
*: 
	In here are the soldiers' quarters.
	Castle staff only, I'm afraid.
*: 
	I was instructed by King Pankraz, the former king, to research the legendary castle of a place known as Zenithia.
*: 
	The problem is, now that His Majesty is no longer around, I don't know if there's any point in continuing my research.
*: 
	Oh, bother! I lost again. Thruppence is just too good for me, I suppose.
*: 
	Hm? What am I talking about? What's everyone talking about!? Monster chess of course! Everyone's crazy about it at the moment.
*: 
	The Chancellor found all these chess pieces in the vault recently, you see.
*: 
	Ever since then, all us soldiers have been completely hooked on it. It's all we think about now!
Sister
	Oh, it looks like you have %H0860%Xa visitor%Yvisitors%Z.
Sister
	I'll be leaving, then.

Sister
	Yes. Your wife is with child. There's absolutely nothing wrong with her. She just needs rest.
Sister

Sancho
	Thees ees wonderful!

	Sí, eet weell be esuch a beautiful child.
Sister
	Well, I'll leave you alone now. Take care. And remember, your wife is in a delicate state now.
Sister
	Well, no doubt you need some time to get used to the idea. It's all very sudden.
Bianca
	Sorry for not tellin' you before, %a000090.
Bianca
	I thought about it, but I was worried you'd call off the whole trip on my account, you see.
Bianca
	I'll stop bein' so selfish now, though. I'm not goin' to insist on travellin' about with you no more.
Bianca
	Nope, I'll stay here and rest, and be sure to give you a nice, healthy baby at the end of it all.
Bianca
	I love you, %a000090.
Sancho
	Felicitations, friend!
Sancho
	I... I thought you were dead.
Sancho
	But now you are back. And you breeng me a beautiful wife and now a beautiful bebé too!
Sancho
	Ees... Ees the most happy day een my life!
	I, I, I... (sob)
*: 
	It's wonderful news.
	Congratulations.
*: 
	I know the King's a kind man, but he wouldn't just let any old passers-by stay here.
*: 
	You must be someone special.
*: 
	I'm glad it was nothing to worry about.
*: 
	His Majesty is waiting for you downstairs.
	Please, go ahead.
Prince Albert
	Ah, Sancho, you old dog! You look tickled pink!
	Good news, is it?
Sancho
	Sí, señor!
	The wonderful news!
	Thees ees...
Prince Albert
	Good Goddess! You mean, Pankraz's son?
	%0%a000090...is alive?
Prince Albert
	By Jove, it is you, %a000090!
	Those eyes! They're just like Mada's.
Prince Albert
	Well, whoever would've guessed it? I never
	imagined that bawling baby would turn into
	such a fine young fellow!
Prince Albert
	Listen to me! I haven't even introduced myself, have I? I'm your uncle. Your father, Pankraz, was my older brother.
Prince Albert
	And who's this young gem you've brought with you?
Nera
	Pleased to meet you, Your Majesty.
	I'm Nera, %a000090's w㈢, %a000090's wi...
Prince Albert
	Steady on there, old girl!
	Are you alright?
Sancho
	Nera!
Sancho
	Thanks to the Goddess.
	Nera, eshe ees awake again.
Sister
	I don't know what she was thinking of, travelling in her condition.
Sister
	She said she collapsed in Battenberg on the way here too.
Sister
	What did she think she was going to do if the
	worst happened?
Sancho
	Ees eserious, Sister?
	Eshe ees very esick?
Sister
	Sick? I don't think you could call it sick.
Sister
	Not something as wonderful as this.
Sancho
	Qué?
Sister
	Congratulations, %a000090.
	Are you ready to be a father?
Sister
	Yes. Your wife is with child. There's absolutely nothing wrong with her. She just needs rest.
Sister
	She's hardly showing at all yet, but according to what she's told me, I'd say she's already quite well progressed.
Sancho
	Thees ees wonderful!
Sancho
	A bebé! My friend's bebé! You and Nera...
	Sí, eet weell be esuch a beautiful child.
Sister
	Well, I'll leave you alone now. Take care. And remember, your wife is in a delicate state now.
Sister
	Well, no doubt you need some time to get used to the idea. It's all very sudden.
Nera
	I'm so sorry, %a000090.
	I know I should have told you, but...
Nera
	I know you. You're so kind and considerate. If I'd told you, you would have stopped your quest.
	And I know how much that means to you.
Nera
	But I won't take any chances now. I know I can't carry on travelling with you.
Nera
	I'll stay here and rest, and make sure I can give you the wonderful, healthy child you deserve.
Nera
	I love you, %a000090.
~ Prince Albert must be extremely worried. ~
~ Better set his mind at ease first. ~
Prince Albert
	Congratulations, you old devil!
	Old penguin features told me the news.
Prince Albert
	Actually, there's something I want to talk to you about. Would you come over here, %a000090?
Prince Albert
	The thing is, %a000090, I've decided to hand over the reins to you. I've rather had my fill of the old kinging game.
Chancellor Jeeves
	Your Majesty! It is considered traditional to discuss such matters with one's chancellor first.
Prince Albert
	Now now, Jeeves. Don't get your knickers in a twist. It makes perfect sense.
Prince Albert
	I mean, I'm a good sport and all that, but I'm hardly kingly material, am I?
Prince Albert
	Now that my brother's son has returned, it would be a trifle ungentlemanly of me not to hand over the throne to its rightful heir.
Chancellor Jeeves
	As you wish, sir.
Chancellor Jeeves
	Of course, there is the small matter of Riteof Passage. It is required that any would-be king undertake the trial there.
Prince Albert
	Oh, come now, Jeeves! The place is positively riddled with monsters these days. It's not like it used to be. Times have changed, you know.
Chancellor Jeeves
	Indeed, sir. Nevertheless, one is bound by tradition, is one not?
Prince Albert
	Hmph. Yes, well...
	I suppose...
Prince Albert
	%0%a000090.
	Did you follow all that?
Prince Albert
	If it was up to me, I'd just say, ⓗListen up, chaps! This is the new King of Gotha.ⓘ
Prince Albert
	But I'm afraid you're going to have to go to
	the cave known as Riteof Passage and get
	the Royal Insignia.
Prince Albert
	It's tradition, you see. To prove you're up to the job, or some such rot. Anyway, do that, and I can give you the throne.
Prince Albert
	You'll find Riteof Passage in the forest to the east of the castle.
Prince Albert
	But you must be pretty much done in for today, I should think.
Prince Albert
	You should rest now, and crack on with the job first thing tomorrow morning!
Bianca
	Mornin', %a000090. We slept like babies last night, eh? Ha ha!
Bianca
	Yeah, I'm feelin' okay now.
	Much better than yesterday.
Bianca
	It's a bit of a surprise findin' out you're prince of this place, eh?
Bianca
	If you become king, then I suppose that'll make our baby a prince or princess.
Bianca
	Not that I really care about that kind of thing, mind.
Bianca
	Nah, I'm perfectly happy with things just
	as they are.
Bianca
	It's good to see you back, %a000090.
Bianca
	You turnin' in for the night now?
Bianca
	Sleep well, eh?
Bianca
	Mornin', %a000090.
Bianca
	Lovely day today, en't it?
Bianca
	We both slept like babies again last night.
Bianca
	You look ever so funny when you're zonked like that.
Bianca
	Not that I can talk, prob'ly! Ha ha!
Bianca
	I wish I could tag along with you, but I can't just go thinkin' about myself any more, eh?
Bianca
	I have to make sure I give you a healthy baby, after all. I can't wait to see the look on your face when the little one arrives!
Bianca
	I wish I could tag along with you, but I can't just go thinkin' about myself any more, eh?
Bianca
	I have to make sure I give you a healthy baby, after all. I can't wait to see the look on your face when the little one arrives!
Nera
	Good morning, darling. I had a wonderful night's sleep last night.
Nera
	Yes, I'm feeling much better now.
Nera
	I had no idea you were a prince!
Nera
	Although I always knew there was something different about you. Something special.
Nera
	I hope I can be worthy of a prince.
	I don't want to let you down, %a000090.
Nera
	Oh, you're back for the day, are you, %a000090?
Nera
	Are you tired? Do you want to rest?
Nera
	Good night then, darling.
Nera
	Good morning, darling.
Nera
	It's a glorious day today. The weather's fantastic.
Nera
	You slept like a baby last night, didn't you?
Nera
	I didn't. I had a terrible dream.
Nera
	You... You won't leave me, will you, %a000090?
Nera
	I want to be right by your side always, but I know that's selfish. I have to think of our child too.
Nera
	I can't imagine anything better than seeing your smiling face after our baby is born.
Nera
	I want to be right by your side always, but I know that's selfish. I have to think of our child too.
Nera
	I can't imagine anything better than seeing your smiling face after our baby is born.
*: 
	His Majesty the King's asked you to do something for him, hasn't he?
*: 
	Well don't you worry about a thing, pet.
	I'll look after your wife. She's in safe hands with me!
*: 
	I know the King's a kind man, but he wouldn't just let any old passers-by stay here.
*: 
	You must be someone special.
*: 
	I won't tell anyone, don't you worry! I don't know you're part of the royal family. I don't know anything about it!
*: 
	The Chancellor made it very clear that anyone who spills the beans will be in serious trouble.
Prince Albert
	If it was up to me, I'd just say, ⓗListen up, chaps! This is the new King of Gotha.ⓘ
Prince Albert
	But I'm afraid you're going to have to go to
	the cave known as Riteof Passage and get
	the Royal Insignia.
Prince Albert
	It's tradition, you see. To prove you're up to the job, or some such rot. Anyway, do that, and I can give you the throne.
Prince Albert
	You'll find Riteof Passage in the forest to the east of the castle.
Chancellor Jeeves
	I think it would be prudent if we remained discreet about your relation to King Pankraz, sir.
Chancellor Jeeves
	Your excursion to Riteof Passage could be rather dangerous. One never knows what might happen.
Chancellor Jeeves
	It would be most unfortunate were the people of Gotha to celebrate prematurely.
*: 
	Take care, sir.
*: 
	I know. It's all hush-hush, right?
	That you're part of the royal family, I mean.
*: 
	The Chancellor would have our guts for garters if we let the cat out of the bag.
*: 
	I was instructed by King Pankraz, the former king, to research the legendary castle of a place known as Zenithia.
*: 
	The problem is, now that His Majesty is no longer around, I don't know if there's any point in continuing my research.
*: 
	Oh, bother! I lost again. Thruppence is just too good for me, I suppose.
*: 
	Hm? What am I talking about? What's everyone talking about!? Monster chess of course! Everyone's crazy about it at the moment.
*: 
	The Chancellor found all these chess pieces in the vault recently, you see.
*: 
	Ever since then, all us soldiers have been completely hooked on it. It's all we think about now!
*: 
	I didn't realise you were a friend of Sancho's.
*: 
	I hope you weren't turned away from here before. Strangers aren't usually allowed in, you see.
*: 
	Mistress Gertrude doesn't listen to a word I say!
Gertrude
	I never asked to be a princess.
Gertrude
	It's only because my father's become King of Gotha. It doesn't matter what I think. I don't have any say in it!
Gertrude
	It's not fair.
	I just want to play.
*: 
	I remember all those long days I stood here, waiting for King Pankraz to return.
*: 
	Then finally one day, I spotted Mr Sancho approaching the castle.
*: 
	I can't tell you how happy I was to see him!
*: 
	But however many times and however hard I looked, King Pankraz wasn't with him.
*: 
	I can't tell you how sad I was not to see him!
*: 
	You're a friend of Sancho's, aren't you?
	You're free to enter.
*: 
	His Majesty, the great Prince Albert, just does whatever the ⓚⓛ Hic! ⓚⓛ Chancellor tells him.
*: 
	It's tard to hell which one of ⓚⓛ Hic! ⓚⓛ them is running the place sometimes.
*: 
	Prince Albert is a great man. A truly
	kind-hearted soul.
*: 
	Of course, I do worry sometimes that he's a bit too kind-hearted. He could be a bit of a soft touch.
*: 
	This is the barracks bar.
	It's for the soldiers, see.
	But you don't look like one of them.
*: 
	I'm a bit worried about them, actually.
	They've all gone mad about this new
	monster chess craze.
*: 
	It's all they think about now. I hope they're paying enough attention to their work.
*: 
	Come on, Thruppence! It must be here somewhere!
	I just counted them and all the pieces were here, but there's one missing now.
Thruppence
	What am I going to do? You can't play monster chess without all the pieces!
~ There's a small, slime-shaped stone on the floor. ~
~ Let Thruppence know? ~
Thruppence
	There it is! You found it for me.
Thruppence
	...Just a minute...
Thruppence
	That's the first time I've looked up from my board in ages. I haven't been thinking about anything other than monster chess.
Thruppence
	It's funny, you know. Once you start, you just
	can't stop.
Thruppence
	All the other soldiers are the same.
	It's got so bad, they're neglecting their duties.
Thruppence
	It was only when I lost this piece that I finally snapped out of it.
Thruppence
	I think it's time I packed it in. I couldn't ask you
	to take it off my hands, could I? You'd be doing
	me a favour.
Thruppence
	These chess sets come from the castle vault, you know. It's sealed up usually, so it'll make a rare souvenir of the place.
Thruppence
	I'm scared I'll end up getting sucked back into the game by the men if I hang onto it.
Thruppence
	Will you take it?
~ %0%a000120 receives a monster chess set! ~
~ %0%a000180 takes the monster chess set. ~
Thruppence
	Thanks! Now I can start concentrating on work again at last!
Thruppence
	Please! You'd really be helping me out.
~ %0%a000120 pretends %A0110%Xhe%Z%B0110%Xshe%Z didn't find anything. ~
Thruppence
	Those monster chess pieces are really well-made though, aren't they?
Thruppence
	People say they were sculpted by a master craftsman who used to live here.
Thruppence
	Hell's bells! Talking about it makes me want to get back into it again!
*: 
	Apparently King Pankraz's wife, Queen Mada, had some special power.
*: 
	Some people even think that's the reason
	she was snatched.
*: 
	Queen Mada isn't dead.
*: 
	That's what I believe, anyway.
*: 
	This is the Chancellor's chamber.
	I'm under strict orders not to let anyone inside.
*: 
	Oh? Is that a Whealbrook bluestone you've got?
*: 
	My dad would've been really excited to see that.
	What a pity he's not around any more.
*: 
	My father was a craftsman, you see. A jeweller.
	He used to work here in the castle.
*: 
	Then one day he just left without telling anyone where he was going, and no one's seen him since.
*: 
	When King Pankraz set off to find Queen Mada,
	a lot of soldiers here tried to go with him.
*: 
	But he wouldn't let them. He said it wasn't fair to ask them to come when he didn't know how long or where his journey would take him.
*: 
	In the end there were just three of them.
	King Pankraz, his baby boy and his right-hand
	man, Sancho.
*: 
	I don't like that Chancellor fellow. As soon as King Pankraz left, he became completely full of himself.
*: 
	I don't trust him.

*: 
	You are %H0860%Xa traveller%Ytravellers%Z, I believe. I too roamed the world prior to my arrival here in Gotha.
*: 
	King Pankraz was most kind and helpful.
*: 
	But were it not for the fate befallen unto Madalena, I have no doubt King Pankraz would
	still be...
*: 
	No. I have said too much. Such vain wishes shall not bring him back.
*: 
	Don't beat me to a pulp! I'm gooey enough as it is.
	And I'm not a bad slime, you know! Really! I promise!
*: 
	It's a long time agoo now, but I uoozed to be Queen Mada's pet slime once.
*: 
	Welcome to Gotha!
*: 
	This is the castle town of Gotha.
*: 
	Our old king, King Pankraz, was a very sharp ruler, you see.
*: 
	That's why he decided that all Gothans
	should live within the castle walls, to protect
	us from our enemies.
*: 
	Woof! Woof, woof, woof!
*: 
	We had a long spell here without a king at all.
	He was away travelling, you see.
*: 
	We were all waiting for him to return, but...
	Well, he never did in the end.
*: 
	Now his brother, Prince Albert, is our new king.
	He took the throne quite a few years ago now.
*: 
	There was once a master craftsman who lived here in the castle, you know. Known as a god among jewellers, he was.
*: 
	But after King Pankraz left the castle, he left too.
*: 
	His son still lives here, though.
	He runs the weapon shop upstairs.
*: 
	When I grow up, I'm going to be a soldier, and I'm going to guard Gotha to the end!
*: 
	My dad's a soldier. Soldiers are cool!
*: 
	I hope the world's a more peaceful place by the time my little boy grows up.
Sister
	There's something very warm and familiar about you... I don't know, maybe I'm just imagining it.
*: 
	King Pankraz dead?
	Pah! I don't believe a word of it!
*: 
	Every time I shut my eyes I see his valiant figure standing proud and tall. So how can he possibly be gone, hm?
*: 
	I was more of a fan of King Pankraz than his brother Albert, to be honest.
*: 
	King Pankraz had vision. He had dreams!
*: 
	Sadly, now we'll never know what those dreams were. But he had them, and that's what counts!
Sancho
	When your father decided to leave Gotha,
	he planned to leave you behind.
Sancho
	But you cried eso hard, friend.
Sancho
	Een the end, we had to breeng you weeth us.
Sancho
	But no one, they deedn't know what would
	happen to us.
Sancho
	Your father, he asked me to no tell you that you were a prince.
Sancho
	I'm esorry, friend! I promised I would no
	tell you!
Sancho
	Forgeeve me. Forgeeve your Uncle Sancho!
Sancho
	And now you must do as Prince Albert, he ees asking you. You must become the King of Gotha.
Sancho
	Otherwise, I cannot look your father een the eyes when I am meeting heem een heaven.
Sancho
	Qué? Chancellor Jeeves, he has placed an embargo on the castle at night?
Sancho
	Even for you? But you are the eson of the
	great King Pankraz! Thees Chancellor,
	he ees a renegado!
Sancho
	Heh! You estay here weeth me tonight, friend.
Sancho
	Like the old days, eh? When I used to
	look after you.
Sancho
	Buenas noches, friend.

	You must go to esee your wife now.
	Maybe eshe ees worrying about you.
Sancho
	So, esoon you weell be a papá, eh, friend?
Sancho
	The days, they go eso fast, no?
*: 
	You're Sancho's friend, aren't you?
*: 
	It would be better if you could stay with him tonight and come back in the morning.

	The castle gates stay shut of a night.

Sancho
	You must tell Prince Albert that you
	have returned.
Sancho
	Maybe you know thees already, but your father, he was the King of thees place, friend.
	The great King of Gotha!
Sancho
	But now hees brother, Prince Albert, he ees our king.

	such a fine young fellow!
Prince Albert
	Listen to me! I haven't even introduced myself, have I? I'm your uncle. Your father, Pankraz, was my older brother.
Prince Albert
	And who's this bally bombshell of a girl you've brought with you, eh?
Debora
	Hmph. You're the King? You're not very imposing for a king, are you? My papa does a better job of looking pompous than you.
Prince Albert
	Steady on there, old girl!
	Are you alright?
Sancho
	Debora!
Sancho
	Thanks to the Goddess.
	Debora, eshe ees awake again.
Sister
	I don't know what she was thinking of, travelling in her condition.
Sister
	She said she collapsed in Battenberg on the way here too.
Sister
	What did she think she was going to do if the
	worst happened?
Sancho
	Ees eserious, Sister?
	Eshe ees very esick?
Sister
	Sick? I don't think you could call it sick.
Sister
	Not something as wonderful as this.
Sancho
	Qué?
Sister
	Congratulations, %a000090.
	Are you ready to be a father?
Sister
	Yes. Your wife is with child. There's absolutely nothing wrong with her. She just needs rest.
Sister
	She's hardly showing at all yet, but according to what she's told me, I'd say she's already quite well progressed.
Sancho
	Thees ees wonderful!
Sancho
	A bebé! My friend's bebé! You and Debora...
	Sí, eet weell be esuch a beautiful child.
Sister
	Well, I'll leave you alone now. Take care. And remember, your wife is in a delicate state now.
Sister
	Well, no doubt you need some time to get used to the idea. It's all very sudden.
Debora
	What? Didn't I know?
Debora
	Of course I knew, you wally!
	But if I'd let on, everyone would've tried to make me go back home to boring old Mostroferrato.
Debora
	Oh, well. I suppose you had to find out eventually.
Debora
	Don't worry. I won't kick up a fuss. I've decided I'm going to stay in Gotha and have the baby here.
Debora
	I know you'll be lost without me by your side, but, well...get over it!
Debora
	Oh, you're awake. I like these castle beds. Yes, I deserve a bed like this. You'll have to buy me one.
Debora
	Right, well... Don't just stand around here. You're in my way. Run along and get on with the adventuring.
Debora
	So, you're a prince, then... And this castle is basically yours...
Debora
	Yes, I am a great judge of character. I mean, you look like a total wimp, but when you got the Circle of Fire and the Circle of Water, I knew.
Debora
	But just because you're Prince %a000090 and I'm ⓗjustⓘ your wife...
Debora
	You've got time to kill, have you?
	I don't think so!
Debora
	Or are you tired? I suppose a little thing like you gets tired easily.
Debora
	Fine. Rest then, if you need to.
Debora
	Morning, lazy. You're going to have to start getting up earlier, you know.
Debora
	What? Breakfast?
	Yes, they brought something.
	I was hungry, so I ate it all.
Debora
	Well, go on then. That's more than enough rest.
	Go and get on with things.
Debora
	And another thing: you're a really noisy sleeper. You woke me up Goddess knows how many times last night.
Debora
	I'm completely exhausted thanks to you.
Debora
	You know, I didn't think I'd enjoy living in a castle quite so much.
Debora
	The servants are very capable. Yes, I'm starting to like Gotha a lot.
Debora
