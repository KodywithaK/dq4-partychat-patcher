Nera
	So that's why he ended up destroying their crops instead. He had to find food somehow.
Bianca
	There's no point tryin' to tell him %a001210 wouldn't attack people. He's in too much of a tizz to listen properly.
Nera
	I can't understand why people are so afraid of %a001210. He's so quiet and sweet.
Bianca
	So much for leavin' %a001210 behind to stop people freakin' out. Looks like they're just as scared of us as they are of him!
Nera
	He's talking about %a001210 as if he's some kind of monster.
Bianca
	That old woman seems relatively calm.
	Maybe she en't scared.
Nera
	The people here in this village seem to think of %a001210 as some kind of monster.
Bianca
	At least kids en't phased by it all, eh?
Nera
	Looks like you're something of a hero in that little boy's eyes, %a000090. He he he!
Bianca
	So you're a monster tamerer, are you? Ha ha!
Nera
	He he he! A monster tamerer! How funny!
Bianca
	Maybe it'd be better if we steered clear of this place from now on, eh?
Nera
	Oh dear. We don't seem all that welcome here. I think we should probably make ourselves scarce.
Bianca
	What a horrible man! It looks like he thinks you got %a001210 to terrorise the village from square one.
Nera
	How rude of him to think something like that of you! What a nasty character!
Bianca
	I feel really down in the dumps now.
Nera
	It looks like it'll be an uphill struggle trying to get these people to understand the situation.
Bianca
	We didn't even say we wanted the
	stupid scarecrow!
Nera
	The people here really are petrified of us,
	aren't they?
Bianca
	Yeah, it's a scary-lookin' scarecrow, alright.
	I'd rather not touch it unless I have to.
Nera
	That scarecrow's not so scary once you get used to it. At least it has a bit of character.
Bianca
	This little adventure didn't turn out so good, eh? At least we got reunited with %a001210, though.
Nera
	He's in shock because he feels like you must have betrayed him. Hopefully he'll come round and
	trust us sooner or later, though.
Bianca
	I'd rather just give back the money the Bailiff give us, wouldn't you?
Nera
	There's no talking to these people. If only they'd give us the chance to explain.
Bianca
	It's nice to finally hear a few words of thanks, eh?
Bianca
	I do feel a bit guilty, mind. Our %a001210 almost had this place on the brink of starvation, after all.
Nera
	That's nice. At least one person here in Hay feels grateful to us for what we did.
Nera
	I feel much better now. Let's just wipe the slate clean and get on with our journey.
Bianca
	Maybe the monster who's bin attackin' Hay hangs out in this cave.
Bianca
	I thought I was only comin' with you to look for
	some ring, and yet here we are goin' after a
	monster again!
Nera
	The monster will probably be quite aggressive because we've strayed into its lair.
Nera
	Do take care, darling.
Bianca
	All them bones scattered about the place are a bit of a worry, eh?
Nera
	It's rather disconcerting seeing all the bones strewn about in here, isn't it?
Bianca
	The paths are a bit dodgy in here, eh?
	Mind where you're walkin', won't you?
Bianca
	Have you still got that ribbon I give you back when we were kids?
Bianca
	That's good. It's nice to know you've kept it
	all these years.
Bianca
	But you've got it right there! Stop teasin' me, you cheeky monkey!
Nera
	Walking along this path with all these holes everywhere is starting to make me feel rather faint.
Nera
	I'm really worried about falling, but I'll do my best to keep up with you.
Bianca
	Oops! I hope that soldier en't fallen on his head.
Nera
	Oh dear! I hope that soldier's alright.
Bianca
	Looks like soldiers are made of pretty stern stuff.
	I didn't expect him to faint, mind.
Nera
	I'm glad he's alright. I wonder where this almighty beast is lurking, though...
Bianca
	You dun't think that giant sabrecat could've bin...
Bianca
	Nah. I s'pose the chances of that are pretty slim, really. Just ignore me.
Nera
	That was strange. That monster seemed to be holding back a little and not attacking with its full might.
Bianca
	So that's the big monster? It seems a bit pitiful to me. I feel bad for goin' after it.
Nera
	Do you think that's the almighty monster? It's a bit different to how I expected. Maybe we could talk it into joining us?
Bianca
	%0%a001210 remembered my ribbon after all this time. That's so cute!
Bianca
	%0%a001210 has bin lookin' after Pankraz's sword all these years. Waitin' to give it back to you sometime, %a000090.
Bianca
	It's goin' to be a bit tricky explainin' this away to the folks back in Hay.
Nera
	Ooh! So this is the first monster you ever
	befriended, then?
Nera
	It must have had a terrible time of it since being parted with you. But it survived. We should be sure to praise it.
Nera
	I feel like I've seen the crest on your father's sword somewhere before.
Nera
	I wonder how we can persuade the people of Hay to forgive %a001210. He did destroy their crops, after all.
Bianca
	We came through here when we moved to Stockenbarrel. It's impossible to find your
	way 'round the place.
Nera
	There are so many stairs here. It looks like it could be a terribly tedious town to get around.
Bianca
	I remember hearin' about some wacky old man researcher who lives here.
Bianca
	Oh! He taught you a new spell, did he? Then I s'pose we owe him one.
Nera
	Mama and Papa say they brought me here when I was little, but I don't remember a thing.
Bianca
	If the smoke bothers him that much, why dun't he just keep his distance?
Nera
	Maybe he should spend his time researching how to research spells without kicking up so much smoke!
Bianca
	Travellin' folk certainly always seem to have their fair share of gossip to pass on, eh?
Nera
	I didn't expect to hear talk of Coburg in such a
	far-flung place.
Bianca
	I wouldn't have minded seein' a royal weddin' neither. Oh well.
Nera
	Yes, Harry must be delighted to have found himself such a beautiful bride.
Bianca
	Hang on a minute! Are we lost too?
Bianca
	Huh, I thought as much. If only we could just jump down off the walls, it'd be dead easy.
Bianca
	Phew. That's a relief. I'm countin' on you, okay, %a000090?
Nera
	I wouldn't get lost even if I walked around with my eyes closed.
Nera
	I have you to look after me and guide me in the right direction, after all!
Bianca
	Yeah, there is a lovely breeze blowin' here all the time, eh?
Nera
	The view here is incredible. I can imagine it's a very relaxing spot.
Bianca
	Blimey! Shoutin' and moanin' like that en't what you expect from a lady, eh?
Nera
	If she stays angry like that, she's going to end up with a face like a slapped behind!
Bianca
	Maybe it's not such a surprise she's so angry with a servant like him.
Nera
	Why doesn't he just say they'd like to stay
	the night?
Nera
	Do you suppose there's something a bit funny
	going on?
Bianca
	It seems to be a bit of a bother for some of the townsfolk, but it sounds like the old man's doin'
	some good work.
Nera
	The old man certainly helped us out by getting the Zoom spell up and running again.
Nera
	It would be lovely if he could keep working on some new spells, but it does seem a terrible inconvenience for the townspeople.
Bianca
	I can understand him wantin' a drink, but he must be pretty desperate to be hangin' about waitin' here on his own.
Nera
	He must really love to drink if he's waiting for the pub doors to open!
Bianca
	Blimey! Somebody was obviously desperate for a drink, eh?
Nera
	Oh dear. We seem to have confused the poor chap and made him all embarrassed.
Bianca
	Smell that booze in the air! I reckon you could get a bit tipsy just from breathin' in this place!
Nera
	Do you think they can really get through that much drink in one night?
Bianca
	Hmm. I can't help feelin' like he's hidin' somethin'.
Nera
	Don't you think he looked a little shifty? Almost as if he was fibbing to us for some reason.
Bianca
	Looks like lots of folk live here together, eh?
Nera
	It must be fun living with lots of people like they do here. Never a dull moment!
Nera
	It was only Mama, Papa, Debora and I in our family, but we still had lots of fun.
Bianca
	Yeah, I s'pose that's fair enough. I'd probably worry about the same thing if I lived here.
Nera
	A fire's one thing, but I'm worried about the effect all that smoke is having on him too.
Bianca
	If that's what floats his boat, then who are we
	to argue?
Nera
	The thing that makes me happiest is being
	with you, darling.
Bianca
	That dun't mean folk should just sit around waitin' for it to happen, though, eh?
Nera
	Maybe the legendary hero will come and save the day. But people should do what they can themselves in the meantime, just in case.
Bianca
	I imagine it'd frighten away the customers too, if it's as bad as it sounds.
Bianca
	Seems like the folk here like to have a bit of fun where the old Zoomshine's concerned. Let's just
	keep quiet, eh?
Nera
	Why would it be their famous brew if it tastes
	so terrible?
Nera
	There's no need for him to be quite so vocal.
	It's not like we'd wipe the town out of its supplies
	or anything!
Bianca
	I wonder what kind of spell he's workin' on this time. It's pretty excitin', eh?
Nera
	The poor old man seems a bit worse for wear.
	I suppose it's only to be expected with how much
	he pushes himself.
Bianca
	Oh, I get it! So that's what it's all about. We'd better not go guzzlin' it down if it's that valuable, then!
Nera
	I don't think even Papa knew about this Zoomshine. We must make sure we look after it carefully.
Bianca
	It's way too smoky here to even think about relaxin'.
Nera
	What a friendly old man he is. I do hope he can improve his relations with the other townspeople somehow.
Bianca
	Crikey! Did I imagine it, or did that cat just talk to us!? Maybe they learn how to do it as they get older.
Nera
	Our dog Bingo chatters away to me sometimes when we're alone, you know. He he he!
Bianca
	It's bin another tirin' day, eh? Maybe we should think about gettin' some sleep before long.
Nera
	Is it alright if we turn in for the night soon, darling? I seem to be feeling terribly sleepy just lately.
Bianca
	Just how long has that soldier bin lost!?
Nera
	I don't mind navigating my way through complicated streets as long as we're together.
Bianca
	It must be freezin' sleepin' on the floor like that.
	I wonder if she made him.
Nera
	Dear me! He must be a terribly restless sleeper to have ended up in that position!
Bianca
	They're a pretty funny couple, eh? That posh woman and her servant sleepin' there on the floor.
Nera
	Surely it can't be good for you to be angry in
	your sleep.
Bianca
	I doubt there's many a place you'd see a priest worse for wear like that, eh?
Nera
	Oh dear. How can a priest possibly give guidance to people when he feels like that?
Bianca
	I wonder if the folk over in Hay are still angry about what happened with %a001210.
Nera
	The people of Hay are probably finding it hard to trust anyone after what happened with us.
Bianca
	That dun't sound good. We should probably pop over there sometime and see what's goin' on.
Nera
	Maybe they've had bad experiences with outsiders in the past that have made them a bit wary.
Nera
	We should visit the place and find out what the problem is.
Bianca
	He's a bit behind the times, eh? That's what comes of bein' down the pub too much.
Nera
	You brought him the missing ingredient ages ago, didn't you, %a000090? That man obviously doesn't know yet.
Bianca
	Right up to the heavens?
	That must be a blimmin' tall tower!
Nera
	I'm sure I'd get terribly dizzy if I ever climbed a tower that high.
Bianca
	It's a bit of a hassle for us and the hero, eh? All this huntin' about lookin' for weapons and the like.
Nera
	Maybe it would be a big help to the hero if we tried to collect the Zenithian Equipment.
Bianca
	I can see why she can't sleep with that awful
	noise comin' from next door! The pub downstairs
	en't quiet neither.
Nera
	That poor woman. There's nothing more frustrating than not being able to get to sleep.
Bianca
	So that's the noise we've bin hearin' since we come in this buildin'! What a racket!
Nera
	He won't have any teeth left if he keeps grinding them at that rate!
Bianca
	I was surprised that he's a mate of yours.
	Friends with a prince, eh?
Nera
	I wonder what people thought of our wedding.
Nera
	Do you think they thought we make a good couple?
Nera
	Oh! That's so sweet, darling!
Nera
	Oh... Then I'll have to try harder from now on to make us look happier together.
Bianca
	The lucky thing! Sounds like he's really enjoyin' that.
Nera
	I always like to drink a nice glass of cold milk after I've had a bath.
Bianca
	Hah! He's doin' a good job of lyin', eh? Let's just leave him be to enjoy his drink.
Nera
	You really shouldn't put people in a position where they have to lie to you, %a000090.
Bianca
	This is where the Circle of Fire was, eh?
Bianca
	You certainly had some nerve, sayin' you'd go after them weddin' rings all on your own!
Bianca
	I feel like our weddin' rings are really special. They belong together more than any other rings in the world ever could.
Bianca
	It's a bit hot under the collar in here, eh?
	Can we get some fresh air?
Nera
	Just look at that lava! I had no idea that the Circle of Fire was hidden in such a scary place!
Nera
	I wonder if Papa realised what a dangerous place he was sending people to.
Nera
	Thank the Goddess that no one lost their life trying to find that silly ring!
Bianca
	What are we doin' here again, %a000090? Got a bit of a thing for this place, have you?
Bianca
	If only there weren't any monsters here, it'd be a beautiful spot to come to, eh?
Nera
	Ooh! A cave behind a waterfall! So this is where you found the Circle of Water.
Nera
	You came here with Bianca, didn't you?
Nera
	Hmm... That makes me feel a little jealous. If only you and I had been childhood friends, %a000090.
Bianca
	Oh yeah? So only a maiden approved by the Goddess gets to open the doors to this place, eh?
Bianca
	Hmm... I s'pose that counts me out, then!
	Come on, let's go!
Nera
	The only one who can open these doors is a maiden with the blessing of the Goddess.
Nera
	I suppose I'm no longer considered a maiden now I'm married to you. I doubt I'd be able to open the doors.
Bianca
	This place has got a really mysterious feel to it.
	And it's ever so pretty too.
Nera
	I never came here during my time at the abbey.
Nera
	I wouldn't have dreamt of travelling around by myself back in those days.
Bianca
	That's a shame. I wonder why you're not allowed to pass of a night.
Nera
	Do you think he has to man this place at this hour? How tiring for him!
Bianca
	Comin' here reminds me of the time we came ghost-bustin' together. That was a scary old night, eh?
Bianca
	I wonder if the Count and Countess are still havin' a nice, peaceful rest.
Nera
	What are we doing at a derelict old castle like this, %a000090?
Nera
	What!? You came here on an adventure with Bianca once? Hmph!
Nera
	It's a little rough around the edges, but I'm sure the place could look fantastic if only someone would give it a bit of attention.
Bianca
	It really is a dusty old hole, eh?
Bianca
	It's like time's stood still ever since we defeated that boss man last time.
Nera
	(cough cough)
	It's terribly dusty in here!
Bianca
	I dun't sense anythin' nasty here no more. Looks like all the monsters have gone for good.
Bianca
	All the shadows and nooks and crannies in this place were pretty scary back when we were kids, eh?
Nera
	There used to be ghosts here when you were little, didn't there?
Nera
	You must have been so brave coming here then! I know it was for %a001210's sake, but still.
Nera
	I feel a bit jealous of Bianca. I wish I'd been the one to come here on that adventure with you.
Bianca
	It was a bit scary last time, eh? All the thunder and lightnin' in this place.
Nera
	Were there coffins lined up in place of beds when you came here last time? Brrr! That's really creepy!
Bianca
	You dun't think that was the Count and Countess, do you? They looked a bit too real.
Nera
	Were they live humans? Or were they...!?
	Darling, I'm scared!
Bianca
	Love across class boundaries, eh? Who do you reckon was the upper class one, then? Him or her?
Nera
	Isn't it sweet that they've stayed together in the face of adversity?
Nera
	If Mama and Papa had been against me marrying you, I probably would've run away from home too.
Bianca
	Sounds like the Count and Countess have bin nice and welcomin' to these two, eh?
Nera
	Thank the Goddess that they're still here to tell the tale. Each day of life could bring new hope and happiness, after all.
Bianca
	Looks like all's well with the graves, so that's a relief.
Nera
	Bianca was buried alive here!?
Nera
	I think I would've been too scared to speak.
	I probably would've ended up dying in there!
Bianca
	This is where I got buried alive! What a laugh, eh!
	Not that it was much fun at the time, mind.
Nera
	The Count was obviously really devoted to his wife, wasn't he?
Bianca
	Do you think that bloke's a ghost, %a000090?
Bianca
	Yeah, he looks a bit transparent, eh? Do you think he can't go to his rest? Or do you think he just likes restin' at the inn too much?
Bianca
	Really? Maybe I should get my eyes tested, eh?
Nera
	D-D-Darling... That man's shadow is r-r-rather weak. Do you think he might be a ghost?
Nera
	Oh! Oh dear! I feel all woozy! Can you hold onto me in case I faint?
Nera
	V-Very well. If you're sure.
Debora
	I wondered what you were doing coming to a village stuck out in the middle of the mountains. 
	You were bringing me to a spa resort!
Debora
	I like your initiative there, %a000090. Keep up the good work and you'll make me a happy wife yet.
Debora
	Soaking in baths like these is good for your skin,
	isn't it?
Debora
	You'd probably be pleased if I became even more beautiful than I am now, wouldn't you?
Debora
	I thought so. You married me for my beauty, after all, so you're bound to be happy.
Debora
	You're not worried about me becoming more beautiful? Surely you're not jealous?
Debora
	I suppose that's quite sweet in a way.
	I'll forgive you.
Debora
	He wants to be a priest? Very strange, if you
	ask me. Nera was full of similar ideas a while
	back, though.
Debora
	I hadn't noticed you were quite so overjoyed about becoming my servant, but he's right, it's written all over your face.
Debora
	People often say that I'm quite cat-like.
	They must mean I'm sweet, right?
~ Debora looks livid! It might be wise to make a ~
~ swift exit. ~
Debora
	I suppose you think that's funny, do you, %a000090?
Debora
	The baths here are good for your skin, you know. We're not far from Mostroferrato, either, so maybe we should come again soon.
Debora
	This is where that Bianca lives, isn't it?
	You can drop in on her briefly if you like.
Debora
	I'm not the kind to get jealous about that sort of thing. I'm very generous, you know.
Debora
	There's nothing to this place apart from the baths. Looks like I'll have to give up on my idea of shopping for new clothes.
Debora
	Oh yes. My veil was made here.
	It was surprisingly well-crafted.
Debora
	A White King's Paradise? Sounds like a figment of someone's imagination, if you ask me.
Debora
	I bet it's just a scam they've come up with to take money from people. There's nothing holy about that!
Debora
	This inn's not bad. You can go in the baths whenever you want and everything. We'll stay here tonight, %a000090.
Debora
	I'm surprised to see a pub in such a small village.
	It must be for the bath-goers.
Debora
	Why would anyone in their right mind want anything to do with this White King's Paradise? It sounds dodgy as anything to me.
Debora
	Looks like that Bianca girl isn't around today.
Debora
	We may as well stay the night now we're here.
	I'll have a bath before bed.
Debora
	I hadn't noticed you were quite so overjoyed about becoming my servant, but he's right, it's written all over your face.
Debora
	Hmm... Maybe you're stronger than you seem.
	Maybe you just look scrawnier than you really are.
Debora
	It should be interesting to find out!
Debora
	It wasn't a bad veil. It was made especially for me for one thing, and it suited me, of course.
Debora
	He's fast asleep. We won't be very popular if we wake him, so let's get out of here.
Debora
	You don't think she's planning on staying up waiting for her husband to come home, do you? She's keen!
Debora
	Just so you know, there's no way I'd ever do that.
	I wouldn't let you go to bed before me, either.
Debora
	What do you think you're doing, bothering people while they're sleeping? Are you trying to make yourself unpopular?
Debora
	Well don't blame me if you wake someone up and get a clip around the ear!
Debora
	Well get away from her then!
Debora
	Surely you don't want to watch any woman but me sleeping. Let's go!
Debora
	He has a good eye for people. Bianca is definitely a catch. Not as much of one as me, of course.
Debora
	Looks like I'm not the only one who finds the whole thing a bit fishy.
Debora
	I thought so. He's got a thing for Bianca, hasn't he?
Debora
	I wouldn't get angry like that if you ever had
	too much to drink. I'd just forbid you from ever drinking again!
Debora
	Scintillating sinter is a famous local speciality,
	if I remember rightly.
Debora
	It doesn't sound like he's from around here, though. He's a bit of a dodgy character, I'd say.
Debora
	There is a lovely smell coming off the baths, actually. I wonder if that's the scintillating sinter.
Debora
	We should definitely take some time for a bath while we're here.
Debora
	Why doesn't he just get out of the well then?
	Or is he stuck? Too weak to climb out on his own?
Debora
	I suppose he can't ask anyone for help if he is, though, what with being here picking scintillating sinter on the sly.
Debora
	Ha ha! Are you speechless in the face of my beauty, %a000090? You're a simple little thing at times!
Debora
	So she's not here. So what?
	I'm not bothered either way.
Debora
	Looks like Bianca won't be home until tonight.
	Any idea where she might be, %a000090?
Debora
	Really? I don't actually care.
Debora
	I thought so. You're only interested in me,
	aren't you?
Debora
	So that's Bianca's father? He's so happy to see you! He doesn't look well, mind.
Debora
	Bianca's certainly popular. I suppose she's quite pretty, and she's nice enough. Not as nice as me,
	of course.
Debora
	That's good, %a000090. Bianca seems well.
	Not that it means anything to me.
Debora
	This is the kingdom your friend's brother rules, isn't it? That friend of yours who came to our wedding,
	I mean.
Debora
	So my servant's friend is big brother to a king.
	That sounds quite impressive!
Debora
	I never heard very good things about Coburg in the past, but it seems peaceful enough now.
Debora
	And you know what peace means? Peace means shopping! Hopefully I'll find a nice new outfit.
Debora
	Prince Harry could be quite a useful person to know. Make sure you keep him onside.
Debora
	I know you're happy, %a000090.
	You married me, didn't you?
Debora
	Hmm... There's a craftsman in Gotha who people call the King of Jewellers.
Debora
	I suppose a man of that skill might be able to make some accessories pretty enough for my lovely self.
Debora
	Do try not to show me up in front of His Majesty, won't you, %a000090?
Debora
	A castle fell from the sky? That hardly sounds likely! How could it have got up there in the first place?
Debora
	And I don't see how it can have been the cause of the monsters going on the rampage, anyway. 
	Sounds like a load of cock and bull to me.
Debora
	It reflects well on me when my servant receives
	a compliment.
Debora
	I doubt looking at you and I makes him feel lonely.
	No, not so much lonely as jealous!
Debora
	You certainly had your finger in a lot of pies, didn't you? Of course, I'd expect no less from a servant of mine.
Debora
	Maybe I could use the Secret of Evolution to become even more beautiful? ...No, I think I've reached the upper limit on that one!
Debora
	I'm not worried about meeting the Queen Dowager! She's not important enough for me to start kowtowing.
Debora
	The Queen Dowager must be a bit stupid to have allowed herself to be usurped by an impostor
	like that.
Debora
	She'd still be in jail now if it wasn't for you, %a000090. A bit more gratitude wouldn't go amiss, in my opinion.
Debora
	This castle's quite impressive. I'd like to live somewhere like this one day.
Debora
	That means you'll have to work hard to make my dream come true, %a000090. I don't mind waiting a little while.
Debora
	We need the legendary hero if we're going to help your mother. It's a pain that he's nowhere to be seen.
Debora
	How can he not have noticed me when I was right there? He must need his eyes testing!
Debora
	Sounds like you and he had a bit of a tough time
	of it.
Debora
	But now you're living happily ever after, and it's all thanks to me. I know you'll be sure to show your gratitude.
Debora
	Harry's quite the imaginative one, having a music box made as a wedding souvenir. Or do you think it was his wife's idea?
Debora
	I let Papa take care of that for my wedding, but now I wish I hadn't. It's the kind of thing you should really decide for yourself.
Debora
	It would be a bit boring if you were stuck here in this castle the whole time. I can see why he wants to go off travelling.
Debora
	Are we getting a room here tonight? Hurry up about it if we are. I don't like being kept waiting.
Debora
	Why is it that men always have to have an excuse for drinking? Can't they just drink because they want a drink?
Debora
	The stars really are pretty. They're twinkling away because of me, you know.
Debora
	People who say something's just between you and them have usually told the world and his wife.
Debora
	Huh! Here we are trying to enjoy our travels, and we have to put up with that kind of nonsense.
Debora
	That woman must've been trying to provoke me. There's no other reason she'd flirt around you
	like that.
Debora
	You're going to meet that girl, are you?
Debora
	It does sound intriguing. I'll come along with you.
Debora
	Hmm... I wouldn't mind perfecting my
	fortune-telling, actually.
Debora
	You'll have to be my guinea pig, obviously. Are you ready to hear the mysterious words of the spirits?
Debora
	Okay, then... Spirits, speak to meee!
	Just as I thought. They say to treasure your wife, the most beautiful woman in the world!
Debora
	Shut up, of course you are. Okay, here we go...
	Spirits, speak to meee! Oh, really? I see...
	They say that you should obey your mistress more.
Debora
	It's a bit of a small town, but it has a few shops, so it's not so bad.
Debora
	You've been to quite a few places in your time, haven't you? It's great for me because it means you tend to know your way around.
Debora
	This is where that Bianca grew up, is it?
Debora
	Why don't you go and look her up?
	Go on, go now before I change my mind.
Debora
	He's lucky to be alive if he deserted the army.
	I would've thought he'd be executed for that.
Debora
	%0%a000090... I know this is unlikely, but you don't ever feel like you might want to desert me, do you?
Debora
	That's what I thought.
	I knew it was unlikely.
Debora
	Is that your idea of a joke? You'll always be my servant, and don't you forget it. I won't permit you to run away!
Debora
	Looks like people here haven't heard about what you did. Not that it bothers me particularly.
Debora
	We had the Zenithian Shield at home, so the other items probably exist too. I wonder where this man is who knows all about legends.
Debora
	So this is where that Bianca used to live all those years ago.
Debora
	This inn's not bad. We could stay here for a few nights if you like, %a000090.
Debora
	It smells quite nice. Could be the perfect accompaniment to a nice afternoon siesta.
Debora
	You have a lot of memories of this place, don't you, %a000090? Not that I care much either way,
	of course.
Debora
	Papa always said that pubs are good places for gathering information because there are so many people coming and going.
Debora
	We'll have to try and have a chat with that man who's supposed to know all about legends.
Debora
	If the legendary hero really existed, then it's certainly not impossible that there are
	descendants of his out there somewhere.
Debora
	Can you hurry up and find us a room? I'm getting tired now, and I need to give myself a manicure before bed.
Debora
	I'm not finding our journey tiresome at all.
	That's because I leave all the annoying jobs to you.
Debora
	You communicate with monsters too, don't you, %a000090? But surely...
Debora
	I wouldn't mind a bath. Get it ready, will you, %a000090?
Debora
	That doesn't mean I want you to get in it, by the way! Just to be perfectly clear.
Debora
	I doubt he'd manage a trip to Stockenbarrel all on his own, but maybe he's stronger than he looks.
Debora
	What a mess! There was no need for them to trash the place quite this much.
Debora
	You look a bit pale, %a000090. I think you'd better have an early night. In fact, that's an order.
Debora
	How annoying! He had what he needed right there in front of him, but he couldn't make use of it.
Debora
	So the only way we can help your mother is to find the hero of what might be nothing but a legend.
Debora
	Hmph. I suppose if that's the only way, then there's nothing for it.
Debora
	I know I'm probably barking up the wrong tree here, %a000090, but I'll ask anyway.
Debora
	I'm right in thinking that you never find our quest for the legendary hero tedious, aren't I?
Debora
	That's good. And it's good that you didn't try to tease me by saying no. I don't have much patience with being teased.
Debora
	That's not funny. And it means you've lost nine points so far. When it gets to ten... You don't even want to know what happens when it gets to ten.
Debora
	I wonder how flowers are managing to bloom in here. How strange!
Debora
	Maybe they're a present for me, in honour of
	my beauty...?
Debora
	What a sad-looking place. It doesn't help that it's night, I suppose.
Debora
	Do you know who this Honey character is?
	A faerie!? Ha ha!
Debora
	You sound just like Nera. She was always going on about faeries when we were kids. I don't believe in them one bit!
Debora
	I suddenly feel this urge to see Mama and Papa.
Debora
	What? You think it's not like me to say something like that, don't you? I suppose you're right.
Debora
	Are we really staying here for the night?
	Well, I suppose if that's what you want.
	I'm not bothered either way.
Debora
	You really love your caves, don't you? It's amazing that you were exploring places like this as a kid.
Debora
	That wasn't a compliment, by the way, so don't get the wrong idea. What I meant was that I find it hard to comprehend, that's all.
Debora
	Caves are damp and smelly and dark and claustrophobic, and there's never any sunshine...
Debora
	You can be as fanatical as you like about them, but you'll never convince me.
Debora
	That's quite impressive, you being let through like that. You surprise me.
Debora
	There's a river flowing above us, isn't there?
	It's a bit of an odd feeling. You don't think this
	place could flood, do you?
Debora
	The breeze coming off the river is quite pleasant.
Debora
	Yes, rivers are to be enjoyed from up above, not to be walked underneath.
Debora
	So this is where your father wasⓚⓛ
~ Debora closes her eyes and bows her head. ~
~ It sounds like she's saying some kind of prayer, but %a000090 can't make it out. ~
Debora
	We should move on soon.
	We can't hang around here forever.
Debora
	You have lots of things you need to do.
Debora
	It's time to go outside now, %a000090.
	We can't stay in here forever.
Debora
	This takes me back. It's a long time ago now, but I once boarded a boat here.
Debora
	Hurled myself at a boat, actually... That would be a more accurate way to describe it!
Debora
	I wouldn't exactly call it peaceful now. It doesn't matter, though. I only ever do what I want.
Debora
	I leave all the things I don't want to do to you, %a000090.
Debora
	Nera came here to study theology for a while, you know. She did something called domestic goddess training too.
Debora
	Hm? Me? There was no need for me to study any of that, so I said no. Papa was a bit peeved for a while.
Debora
	You seem to get on with the nuns here very well.
	Not that it bothers me.
Debora
	A prince on a white horse? And there was me thinking they only existed in faerie stories.
Debora
	It would be a shock. You don't usually tend to find royalty visiting places like this.
Debora
	We obviously don't look like husband and wife.
	Oh well, it can't be helped. You must look like
	my servant, that'll be why.
Debora
	She's right. You do have kind eyes.
Debora
	You're more of a servant than a husband, though. That's where she had it a bit wrong.
Debora
	She should definitely be back by now. Maybe she's decided to take a detour and have a bit of fun.
Debora
	I don't know how Nera managed to endure this place for so long. She tends to get very lonely.
Debora
	It would be a shock. You don't usually tend to find royalty visiting places like this.
Debora
	We obviously don't look like husband and wife.
	Oh well, it can't be helped. You must look like
	my servant, that'll be why.
Debora
	She should definitely be back by now. Maybe she's decided to take a detour and have a bit of fun.
Debora
	Put our kids through what this girl's been through, and I'll never forgive you, %a000090. Got it?
Debora
	I've been here lots of times in the past with Papa and Nera, but Papa would never let us go on anything.
Debora
	I'm going to really go for it this time, though!
	I've got you, my walking wallet, with me after all, %a000090!
Debora
	The place is bustling now, but apparently it used to be a bit of a ghost town.
Debora
	If a ghost town can transform itself into such a thriving city, then I suppose that means there's hope for you yet.
Debora
	I don't really want to make any money.
	I'm already rich.
Debora
	Even if I did want to make money, I'd leave that up to you, %a000090.
Debora
	If people are going to spread rumours like that, you'd think they'd at least give credit where it's due.
Debora
	He looks intelligent enough, so you'd think he'd try and get his facts straight. You men are all useless!
Debora
	My dream when I was young was to have a
	whole army of servants to attend to my every
	whim and wish.
Debora
	I wouldn't complain if you wanted to go gadding about at night. I'd just come along with you.
Debora
	Even if you're ⓗmisterⓘ, I'm definitely not ⓗmissusⓘ.
	I'm ⓗSignorinaⓘ, and I always will be!
Debora
	If he dares call me ⓗmissusⓘ, I'll grab him by the scruff of the neck! I know he's young, but that's
	no excuse.
Debora
	Oh yes. Papa wanted one of those once. Looks like he's not the only one with a penchant for the weird and the wonderful.
Debora
	Yes, Papa wanted one of those a long time ago.
Debora
	He's always been keen on collecting strange things.
Debora
	Make sure you look after that shield, %a000090. You can't be too careful.
Debora
	Just so you know, %a000090...
	I'd never forgive you if you behaved like that.
Debora
	You have to keep a tight rein on your man if you want to control him properly. Just like I do with you.
Debora
	Why don't they just shut up shop during the day and only open up at night then? It doesn't take a genius to work that out.
Debora
	Your home is wherever I happen to be.
	That goes without saying, of course.
Debora
	Being able to nap during the day is a sign of high status. That's just how I want to live.
Debora
	Papa may be a bit of a beached whale nowadays, but he used to be an explorer back in his day.
	So he says, anyway. I can hardly believe it.
Debora
	It's mouldy and dark and claustrophobic...
	Can you hurry up and finish what you're doing
	here so we can leave?
Debora
	A bunny girl stuck down in a cave?
	Talk about a fish out of water!
Debora
	Even I'd never give you an order that would put you in jail, %a000090, don't worry.
Debora
	He deserves what he gets if he went about kidnapping people. It's always good to see
	people get their comeuppance.
Debora
	Casinos are fun, but I'd never get that worked up about them. Maybe it's because I'm already rich.
Debora
	Casinos are just fun and games. If you start to obsess over money, that's when the fun ends.
Debora
	Papa said it's important to be calm when you're betting lots of money, but that man's eyes were 
	all bloodshot.
Debora
	He's sure to lose if he's in that sort of state. Still, as long as it's not me losing, then why should I care?
Debora
	I don't think I've ever met someone as deserving of the description ⓗbuffoonⓘ as this character.
	I can hardly believe it.
Debora
	I suppose it's not a bad performance. The dress would obviously suit me much better, though.
Debora
	He's right. If you let the fear get to you, it really puts you off your stride. He's wiser than he looks.
Debora
	You make your own luck. You just need a bit of patience and courage and you can turn the tide in your favour.
Debora
	I wouldn't particularly mind if the night went
	on forever.
Debora
	Ha ha! I do know that's not what he meant, you know. I was just joking.
Debora
	There are certainly plenty of uglies!
	I suppose it could be quite fun to people-watch.
	The customers here are such a mixed bag.
Debora
	If the legendary hero exists, you'd think he'd just hurry up and show his face. Still, travelling about looking for him is quite good fun, I suppose.
Debora
	If anyone's going to get up on stage, it should be me. You know that, %a000090.
Debora
	I wish I could wear a dress like that. It just isn't practical for the kind of places you take me, though.
Debora
	I don't care if a man's rich or not.
	I have enough money of my own.
Debora
	If you want to open it, just open it.
	I'm not interested, personally.
Debora
	Yes, I didn't think I saw them when I was here with Papa and Nera in the past.
Debora
	We don't have anything we need to do here, right? Then let's hurry up and leave!
Debora
	What funny-coloured slimes! It could be quite fun to keep a few as pets.
Debora
	He's a little bit too carried away with it all, isn't he? It's quite funny to watch him, though.
Debora
	Maybe I'll try sharing a bed with some slimes one day. They're so soft, I'm sure it'd be comfortable.
Debora
	You'd get me a few slimes if I wanted, wouldn't you, %a000090?
Debora
	You're quite useful, you are. Being able to deliver the goods is the mark of a good servant, you know.
Debora
	Surely you're not...jealous!? No?
Debora
	They'd be too slimy to cuddle?
	Hmm... You could have a point there.
	Maybe I'll give it a miss for now.
Debora
	So monsters worry about the weather just like us humans. Now there's a slurprise!
Debora
	Maybe there's even a town out there that's full of just monsters. I doubt it, though.
Debora
	I'm impressed that they managed to build a T 'n' T board this big.
Debora
	If you could fix how the die rolled, you'd be able to win as many times as you liked.
Debora
	I love winning. No matter what it takes.
Debora
	He said ⓗtooⓘ, which implies he fell off as well,
	so he's hardly in a position to be laughing at us.
Debora
	Can you believe that he's getting his kicks out of watching people fall?
Debora
	I think it's more fun to be the one falling than the
	one watching.
Debora
	It's very lively. This place really comes into its own at night.
Debora
	I don't mind having a bit of fun, %a000090, but I refuse to do an all-nighter. It's bad for your skin.
Debora
	If you want to have a bit of a gamble, then I'll allow it. Not for long, though.
Debora
	An island in the south doesn't really appeal to me.
	I'd rather live in a huge mansion in a big bustling city.
Debora
	Or a castle, if there are no mansions available.
	I'm really not that fussy, %a000090.
Debora
	I'm going to have a bath again tonight, %a000090. You know what you need to do, right?
Debora
	That's right. Make sure you stand guard.
	I should think I can trust you to do that properly.
Debora
	You have to stand guard like this man. He's a fine example of devotion to one's lady wife.
Debora
	Stupid girl, screaming like that! I bet you're glad you didn't marry an irrational, screeching monster like her, aren't you, %a000090?
Debora
	It'd be good if there were no more monsters, but then you wouldn't have any of your little friends to help you out.
Debora
	Still, that's your problem, not mine.
Debora
	Handsome? Well, I wouldn't be seen with an ugly man. We'd look so unbalanced.
Debora
	I don't need to trouble myself with cooking.
	That's why people have chefs.
Debora
	It doesn't sound like the one here is worth
	employing, though.
Debora
	What an odd way of doing business! Quite a clever way, mind you, making you buy something before he'll sell you something else.
Debora
	I've probably told you this before, but I often used to fight with Mama and Papa.
Debora
	I said some terrible things, but they never once even hinted that they'd like me to leave.
Debora
	I couldn't understand why they put up with me for so long. I mean, they're not even my real parents.
Debora
	Now I have a family of my own, though, I've started to have an idea of how they must've felt.
Debora
	...Anyway! I don't know what's got into me, coming out with all this. Hurry up, %a000090.
	Time to move on!
Debora
	He must be important if he can afford to spend every day in the pub.
Debora
	Fortune-telling is a load of rubbish. You make your own fortune in this life. I know I always have.
Debora
	Either be awake or be asleep, girl, not somewhere in the middle! That was creepy.
Debora
	They say a sleeping face is like that of an angel,
	but that certainly doesn't apply to him.
Debora
	We did pay good money for it, so we should probably have a look. I'm not interested myself, but I'll hang around while you look.
Debora
	If you don't want it, then don't buy it.
	You can always come back another time if you change your mind.
Debora
	You wanted to buy it and you bought it.
	None of my business.
Debora
	If you want to buy something, make sure you can afford it. Don't embarrass me like that again.
Debora
	This place must do quite a trade with its regular customers. People like you can't resist collecting strange things.
Debora
	Casinos are fun, but I'd never get that worked up about them. Maybe it's because I'm already rich.
Debora
	Casinos are just fun and games. If you start to obsess over money, that's when the fun ends.
Debora
	He's far too carried away. I'm embarrassed just looking at him.
Debora
	This is what happens if you get too carried away. The hundred-token slots are only for rich people. It's important to remember that.
Debora
	If I became a performer, I'd have my own changing room right from the start. Not that I ever want to become a performer, of course.
Debora
	There are certainly plenty of uglies!
	I suppose it could be quite fun to people-watch.
	The customers here are such a mixed bag.
Debora
	If the legendary hero exists, you'd think he'd just hurry up and show his face. Still, travelling about looking for him is quite good fun, I suppose.
Debora
	I can dance much better than them. I'll have to show you one of these days. When I'm in the mood, that is.
Debora
	I don't think it's a famous song.
	I suppose it's not too bad, though.
Debora
	Huh! I'm much classier than she is.
	Never mind. Just get off the stage.
Debora
	Is she challenging me? If she really wants to see me dance, I'll dance. Da-da-daa, Da-da-da-daaa... Ⓠ There!
Debora
	Hey, you're not actually that bad.
	Not a patch on me, of course.
Debora
	There's no need to worry. If you stick by me, there's nothing to fear.
Debora
	There really is nothing here, is there?
	I much prefer being in town to being in
	the countryside.
Debora
	I'm leaving, %a000090.
	What do you mean, why?
	Can't you take a hint?
Debora
	The fields are in a mess, that's for sure.
	Maybe the monster's coming on the rampage
	because he's low on food too.
Debora
	There's no point heading into the hills for food.
	That's like signing your own death warrant.
Debora
	I'm sure Papa would send some food if I asked
	him. That wouldn't solve their problem with the monster, though.
Debora
	I don't mind helping them if that's what you want to do, %a000090. Could be quite good fun putting that monster in its place.
Debora
	I suppose I'll put up with this place for tonight.
	You'd better find us a decent inn tomorrow, though.
Debora
	She's very skinny, isn't she? Must be because she's not eating a decent diet.
Debora
	So the monster isn't intimidated by the scarecrows... Never mind. I'm sure I'll be able to terrify him
	into submission!
Debora
	I've got a feeling I saw a cave to the west of here. Maybe that's where the monster's hiding out.
Debora
	It may not be attacking people, but it's attacking their food, which amounts to the same thing.
Debora
	Do you think that was the monster? Could be a bit tricky getting the better of that thing!
Debora
	There's nothing to this place. Not even a sound!
	It's far too quiet if you ask me. The silence is creepy.
Debora
	Typical country folk, locking their doors at this hour! You'd never find that in Mostroferrato.
Debora
	Are we going to stay here? If we are, I'm taking
	that decent-looking bed over there. You'll sleep anywhere, right?
Debora
	I've never had a problem with getting lots of attention, but I don't like the way they stare here. It's like they're scared of me.
Debora
	Charming! After we went to all that effort to figure out their problem for them, this is the thanks we get!
Debora
	That man was actually shaking with fear!
	Still, I suppose that's understandable.
Debora
	But %a001210 wouldn't do him any harm! He needn't be afraid for his life like that, the silly man.
Debora
	That old woman has courage. I'll bet she was a feisty girl like me back in her day.
Debora
	Children are so innocent.
	They know no fear, either.
Debora
	I've known for a long time that you're a
	monster tamer.
Debora
	But you're still my servant first and foremost,
	and don't you forget it!
Debora
	There's no need for him to beg. I'll gladly stay away. Let's go, %a000090.
Debora
	I couldn't care less what they think of us.
	We haven't done anything wrong.
Debora
	Maybe we should take it as our reward.
	It could come in useful.
Debora
	Urgh! I don't want to carry it, though.
	That's your job, %a000090. Got it?
Debora
	It's not that scary at all, is it? Um...why are you eyeing it up against me like that?
Debora
	I'd say it's more loopy of him to believe the nasty rumours about us than it was for him to have trusted us in the first place.
Debora
	At least there's one person here that isn't a complete idiot. Huh! What a load of bumpkins!
Debora
	You'll be able to take care of a monster or two,
	won't you, %a000090? I can just sit back and spectate.
Debora
	You don't think all the bones around here are fromⓚⓛ Never mind. It doesn't scare me!
Debora
	There are holes all over the place.
	You'd better watch where you're walking.
Debora
	If we're going to fall down a hole, you're going first. And you're going to break my fall! I won't look too kindly on you if you don't.
Debora
	Do you think that soldier's alright? He's a bit of a wimp, isn't he? I reckon you could fall down a hundred times and still live to tell the tale.
Debora
	He's the one who gave us a fright, not the other way around! I'd have chucked you down the hole again if you made me jump like that!
Debora
	So that's the famous monster? Hmm... Having a magnificent creature like that as a pet would probably reflect quite well on me.
Debora
	No way! This beast used to be your pet when you were little?
Debora
	And he looked after your father's sword for all those years since. It's true that pets resemble
	their masters.
Debora
	I can't help feeling that I've seen the insignia on your father's sword somewhere before. Now where can it have been...?
Debora
	How exactly are you planning on explaining all of this to those bumpkins in Hay? I don't think they're going to like this somehow.
Debora
	This town's like a maze. I never lose my way, but I'm a bit worried that you might, %a000090.
Debora
	The man who taught you the Zoom spell lives here?
Debora
	You should be grateful to him, you know. He's saved you the task of carrying me across mountain ranges.
Debora
	If the smoke's making him cough, then why doesn't he just move? Some people don't have the brains they were born with!
Debora
	I'm surprised to hear talk of Coburg all the way out here. We're half the world away!
Debora
	Yes, she was quite pretty. I don't mind admitting that. But she didn't possess anything like my beauty.
Debora
	It is quite a frustrating place to navigate.
	I wonder if the people here ever get lost
	on their way to the shops.
Debora
	It is quite pleasant here. Maybe I'll take a little nap. You'll stand guard, won't you, %a000090?
Debora
	That's strange. Watching her gave me an odd sense of déjà vu. I must just be imagining it, though.
Debora
	What a useless servant! His mistress obviously doesn't have the good eye for people that I have.
Debora
	If he manages to come up with a new spell, we'll have to come and learn it straight away.
Debora
	Well, you can learn it. I'll just have you use it for me whenever I feel like it.
Debora
	He must have plenty of time on his hands to be just standing around here waiting for the place to open.
Debora
	Ha! He thought you worked in the pub!
	Just goes to show that you look like the
	serving type, %a000090.
Debora
	Surely they don't get through that much in a night? Ah... That explains why the town's so higgledy-piggledy.
Debora
	Why? Because the people who planned it were all three sheets to the wind, of course!
Debora
	That man's lying. He can't pull the wool over my eyes that easily.
Debora
	It's just the two of us at the moment, but I'm sure we'll have a bigger family one day, so you'd better hurry up and sort us out a mansion.
Debora
	She's worrying too much. Mind you, he could well start a fire with all that smoke billowing away.
Debora
	I suppose the thing that makes me happiest is being able to do whatever I please.
Debora
	Isn't it a bit weird, just waiting and hoping that the legendary hero will make an appearance?
Debora
	The least they could do is all club together and
	go looking for him. That'd make our task easier,
	at any rate.
Debora
	It's sad that people want to drink something that's supposed to be so evil it frightens monsters away.
Debora
	Of course, it's up to you if you want to try it.
Debora
	That's a shame. I was looking forward to
	seeing your face if it tasted foul, but it's
	actually quite nice.
Debora
	This spell research is all well and good, but it won't be any use to anyone if he kills himself in the process.
Debora
	I can see why they try to keep it under wraps now. You'd better take good care of it, %a000090.
Debora
	I think he might be lonely, you know.
	His face lit up when he saw you.
Debora
	People say that cats start to talk when they get old, and it's true. That's so creepy.
Debora
	Nera often used to talk to our dog, you know. Totally pointless, if you ask me.
Debora
	Let's find somewhere to stay the night soon, %a000090. I've been getting a bit tired lately.
Debora
	Looks like he's still lost.
	Oh well. Not my problem.
Debora
	I'd never order you to sleep on the floor, %a000090. You must be relieved to have such an easy-going boss.
Debora
	It's her own fault for not choosing her travelling companion wisely. I'd never make that mistake.
Debora
	If the priest's lost, then who are people supposed to go to for guidance?
Debora
	It's really not your problem.
	Just forget about it.
Debora
	Hay? Yes, I've heard of that place.
	Sounds like a hick town to me.
Debora
	If you still want to go, though, don't let me stop you.
Debora
	You already brought him the ingredient he needed to get Zoom working, right? This man needs to get his gossip up to date.
Debora
	If it goes right up to the heavens, it must be
	pretty tall.
Debora
	You won't catch me climbing it. If you're determined to go to the top, you'll have to carry me.
Debora
	That's a point. If the legendary hero does exist, he's probably looking for the Zenithian Equipment too. We might bump into him if we're lucky.
