Bianca
	What a weird place!
	Is this...the underworld?
Nera
	So this is Nadiria. I had no idea it was such a
	wild-looking place.
%0%a001240
	What a lonely looking place. It's totally different to our world, don't you think?
%0%a001250
	Look, Dad. The map's changed.
Sancho
	Eso thees ees Nadiria. Thees ees the place señor
	Pankraz ees always wanting to find.
Tuppence
	So this is N-N-Nadiria...! Dear me, it's set me right on edge, I can tell you. I'm not sure if I'm up to this.
Bianca
	It can't be far now before we reach your mum.
Bianca
	I always expected it to be a nasty kind of place, but I didn't imagine it would be this bad.
Bianca
	It dun't look like this place ever gets much sun.
Bianca
	I wonder if this is what would happen to our world too, if Grandmaster Nimzo took over.
Nera
	We must push on. It can't be long now until we find your mother.
Nera
	It's hard to imagine that your mother's spent more than twenty years in such a desolate, lonely place.
Nera
	I don't sense anything living around here.
	Apart from monsters, that is.
%0%a001240
	We've had our tough times up to now, so this place isn't anything we can't handle!
%0%a001240
	Hang on in there, Grandma! We're coming to rescue you soon!
%0%a001240
	What do you think it's like down below?
%0%a001240
	It's impossible to see, what with that creepy mist all over the place.
%0%a001250
	Urh... My head hurts. There's a really sinister air coming up from deep down underground.
%0%a001250
	It's okay. I'll keep battling on.
	It's for Grandma's sake, after all.
Sancho
	Qué? You no escared, are you?
Sancho
	No, no, no. Ees no need to be escared.
	You have eso many amigos een your party now.
Sancho
	And all of the amigos who no weeth us right now, they cheer for us from the wagon.
Sancho
	Perdón. I esorry. Your Uncle Sancho, he ask esometheeng estupid. Ees notheeng to make you escared now, sí?
Sancho
	Señora Mada, eshe ees esuch a kind and
	gentle señora.
Sancho
	I esure the monsters, they understand her
	kind and gentle heart too, no?
Tuppence
	Mother often spoke fondly of Queen Madalena.
Tuppence
	She said she'd never known a woman more
	beautiful or kind. I'm rather looking forward to making her acquaintance.
Tuppence
	Brr... It's rather chilly here. This place feels just like the Land of Death I once read about in a book.
Bianca
	I hope your mum's okay. There's no time to lose, %a000090!
Nera
	I'm rather concerned about your mother's well-being. We must hurry.
%0%a001240
	We need to pay that nasty Ladja back for what he did to Grandpa too, so we can't let him win next time!
%0%a001250
	Ladja... First he kills Grandpa and now he's threatening Grandma too. We can't let him
	get away with this!
Sancho
	Muchas gracias, My Majesty, for letting your Uncle Sancho accompany you on thees day.
Sancho
	Thees Ladja, he ees about to breathe hees last breath. I revenge your father's death.
	I fight for señor Pankraz!
Tuppence
	That despicable Ladja character! I do hope Queen Madalena can sit tight until we get there.
Bianca
	Maybe happiness is bein' able to fight to help someone, dun't you think?
Bianca
	I mean, it proves you're alive, dun't it?
Bianca
	I'll never forget about your mum, not as long as
	I live.
Bianca
	So we'll have to make sure we live a long time.
	That way, her memory will live on for longer.
Nera
	This place is filled with an overwhelmingly evil power, but I won't let it make me falter.
Nera
	I'm sure it's your existence that enabled your mother to carry on her fight alone all these years.
Nera
	I feel just the same way, you see. I'd do absolutely everything in my power to protect our children.
%0%a001240
	Dad, I don't get it.
%0%a001240
	Why are there such nasty characters in the world? Why can't they all be nice, like the monsters we've made friends with?
%0%a001240
	So the really bad guy is Grandmaster Nimzo, right? I'll sort him out, don't you worry!
%0%a001240
	Grandpa, Grandma...
	Watch over us, please.
%0%a001250
	I hate the underworld. I wanted to show Grandma a nice, pretty sky and a beautiful blue sea.
%0%a001250
	Thinking about Grandma makes me want to cry,
	but I'm going to be strong and hold back my tears.
%0%a001250
	Um, Dad... When we've finished travelling...
%0%a001250
	Um... Nothing. Never mind.
Sancho
	You believe we really take victory?
	I no eso esure...
Sancho
	No! Perdón! Ees thees air. Ees making me theenk eso negatively.
Sancho
	When I look back, ees a very long way we are travelling. Sí, a long, long way.
Tuppence
	Brr... I'm cold. The underworld certainly isn't the kind of place one would choose to hang about in.
Tuppence
	Are you sure about your choice of companions, %a000090? I'm not sure I'm quite cut out for this.
Debora
	So this is Nadiria. The air here looks like it's bad
	for the skin. Let's do what we came to do and get out of here.
Debora
	I don't think I could survive being stuck in such a desolate place for years on end.
Debora
	Let's get down to business and hurry up with rescuing your mother, %a000090.
Debora
	You can't see the sun from here. Somehow I
	don't think that's the only reason for the chill in
	the air, though.
Debora
	I remember that Ladja character. First he dares
	to turn me into stone and now he's threatening
	your mother!
Debora
	I'll make him pay for this!
Debora
	All of the pain and suffering my dear family has had to endure... All of it is Nimzo's doing.
Debora
	I'll make him regret the day he dared anger me, more than he could possibly imagine.
Debora
	%0%a000090...
	I feel your pain.
Debora
	But you must be strong. Turn the pain into anger... Fan the flames... And then turn it all on Nimzo and make him pay.
