The Winter Queen
	Kah ha ha ha hah!
	I see we have %H0860%Xa visitor%Yvisitors%Z! Wonderful!
The Winter Queen
	So rude of me to leave a child in charge of reception. Even if he is a wannabe superhero!
The Winter Queen
	I do apologise. But I assure you,
	I'll make up for it now.
	Kah ha ha ha hah!
~ The Winter Queen suddenly turns into a monster! ~
Dwight
	It's you again!
	I...urgh...
The Winter Queen
	Kah ha ha ha hah!
	I do hope my hospitality last time was to your satisfaction.
The Winter Queen
	And now I'll be more than happy to entertain you again!
The Winter Queen
	Ah! Aaaargh!
	My body! I'm burning up!
	Aaaargh...
Dwight
	Ahchoo! Dat was a surprise.
	I had no idea da Winter Queen was an evil monster.

Dwight
	You'd bedda take id back to Treacle, I suppose.
	Da White Dwarf reigns supreme!
	Ahchoo!
*: 
	You found the Herald of Spring for Treacle?
*: 
	That's amazing! You're amazing!
	I'm amazed! Tee hee hee!
*: 
	So it was the Winter Queen behind it all from the very beginning? I wonder who she is...
*: 
	So all the snow will goo away now?
	Thank the Gooddess!
*: 
	Boing along and give Treacle the flute, then. Or you'll be accoozed of dawdling.
*: 
	So someone was trying to freeze us all into early graves, were they?
*: 
	Well I hope this is the end of all the trouble now. I'd hate to think it was the start of even bigger problems...
*: 
	You're certainly brave for a young'un. So this long winter's finally drawing to a close, eh? Better get down to business then...
*: 
	Unbelievable! You really did get the Herald of Spring back!
*: 
	There's more to you than meets the eye!
*: 
	Aaah, nothing like a good soak! Some people go wrinkly if they stay in too long, but not me!
*: 
	Have you ever heard of the underworld? Brrr, it's cold down there. Bone-rattlingly cold!
*: 
	I don't want to go back there. Not ever!
	They don't have baths in the underworld!
*: 
	I hadn't had a customer in such a long time, I thought spring had come early when you first came to Faerie Lea.
*: 
	And now it has come. But you're going, I suppose. Spring's arrived, and my only customer's leaving! Best not waste any time, eh?
*: 
	Treacle sees everything. She was watching when you fought the Winter Queen.
*: 
	You saved us and our faerie world.
	Thank you, %a000090.
*: 
	Oh, my! You got it back! The Herald of Spring!
	I suppose humans have their uses sometimes.
*: 
	The faeries are responsible for the passing of the seasons.
*: 
	If winter had gone on much longer, the world might have frozen over completely.
*: 
	The view from here in springtime is breathtaking.
*: 
	As soon as Treacle blows the Herald of Spring, a warm breeze will bring all the pretty little petals and buds of the new season.
*: 
	Now we can call spring like we're supposed to. Thank you, %a000090.
Treacle
	Spritely saints! The Herald of Spring!
Treacle
	Come, %a000090.
	Let me take a good look at your face...
Treacle
	We couldn't have asked for more from anyone, %a000090.
Treacle
	At last I can fulfil the duty of the faeries: to call an end to this long, harsh winter and summon spring into the world.
Treacle
	I really don't know how we can thank you.
	Except, perhaps, to promise you this...
Treacle
	If you ever find yourself in trouble ⓚⓛ when you are a little older, I mean ⓚⓛ come to our land again.
Treacle
	We will do whatever we can to repay you for your bravery. So remember us, %a000090.
Treacle
	And now it's time for you to return to the world where you belong.
Honey
	%0%a000090! I'll never forget you!
Honey
	Here. Have this so that you never forget me either.
~ %0%a000090 receives a branch. ~
Honey
	Tee hee hee! Were you expecting something better?
	Don't worry, it's only withered now because of the cold.
Honey
	Once spring comes, it'll be bursting with hundreds and hundreds of pretty little flowers.
Honey
	Goodbye, %a000090.
	Take care.
~ Treacle puts the Herald of Spring gently to her lips... ~

*: 
	Aah. Maybe it's just my imagination, but it feels a bit warmer all of a sudden.
	Perhaps spring's here at last.
*: 
	It's extremely dangerous outside of the village. You be a good boy now and go back home where you'll be nice and safe.
*: 
	Sorry? Have I seen Pankraz leavin' town?
	Well, no. I can't say I have.
*: 
	It certainly seems to be gettin' warmer. Hopefully now I'll finally be able to get my crops a-growin'.
*: 
	Hey! Where did you get that stone, boy? Find it at the bottom of the well, did you?
*: 
	I went huntin' about in the cave back in my younger days, lookin' for some of them famous Whealbrook bluestones.
*: 
	Ah, yes. I remember pokin' about them big
	rocks hopin' for a sign of some ore. It doesn't
	half take me back.
*: 
	It certainly seems to be gettin' warmer. Hopefully now I'll finally be able to get my crops a-growin'.
*: 
	I'll be needin' some water from the well before long, I'd say.
*: 
	Meow!
*: 
	Whealbrook here's only a tiny village. If it's castles and the like you're after, you'll have to go to Coburg. Off to the east, it is.
*: 
	You're Pankraz's son, if I'm not mistaken.
*: 
	This might just be hearsay, but it sounds like he's got an almighty enemy out there somewhere.
*: 
	If only you were more grown up, you'd be able to help him out.
*: 
	You're not thinkin' of explorin' that cave again, are you? Your father was lookin' for you, you know.
*: 
	You should forget about the cave and go and see what it is he wants.
*: 
	Hm? You need to look for somethin' in there, you say? Well, what are you goin' to do if he ends up leavin' without you?
*: 
	You worry about what's in the cave after you've been and seen your dad. Go on now, run along!
*: 
	Ah, hello there, %a000090. I was just prayin' for your father's safety on his journey.
*: 
	The King of Coburg's got a bit of a cheek, summonin' your father without so much as a by your leave.
*: 
	If he's the one who wants to meet, then he's the one who should go trekkin' across country to do it!
Pankraz
	There you are, %a000090.
	Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you.
Pankraz
	Never mind. It doesn't matter now.
	I was just saying a prayer before setting off again.
Pankraz
	You should do the same. I'll be waiting for you at the town entrance.
*: 
	I hear Pankraz has bin summoned over to Coburg Castle.
*: 
	He's more than a little bit famous around these parts for how strong he is, so I s'pose that's why they want him.
*: 
	Oh, not again! Someone's gone and written something strange here in my guest book.
*: 
	Now what's this all about...
*: 
	ⓗThank you so much, %a000090.
	Can't wait to meet again one day!
	Sweet wishes, Honeyⓘ
*: 
	What a load of nonsense!
*: 
	So you're Pankraz's son are you, boy?
*: 
	Come to think of it, I seem to remember there bein' a King Pankraz of somewhere or other once.
*: 
	Not that that has anythin' to do with your dad, of course!
*: 
	My old man found the glass he was after, but it doesn't look like the thing Pankraz is lookin' for is so easily found.
*: 
	I heard it was somethin' to do with a legendary hero or the like.
*: 
	Sorry! Listen to me, borin' a kid with grown-up stuff like that!
*: 
	Dear, oh dear, oh dear! Not another empty pot!
*: 
	This is all very odd!
*: 
	I decided to have a feast. That's what the old dragon thought I'd done anyway, so I may as well get some pleasure out of the ear-bashin'!
*: 
	If only I was as good as my old man at makin' medicine. One of these days...
Mr Rockefeller
	So Pankraz has been called to Coburg Castle, eh?
Mr Rockefeller
	There's all sorts of kerfuffle there at the moment about who's goin' to succeed to the throne. You want to be careful.
Pankraz
	All done, %a000090?
	Good, then we'll get going. I've been summoned to Coburg Castle.
Pankraz
	Don't worry, it's not too far. Nothing like the long sea voyage I took you on before.
Pankraz
	And once this little trip's over with, I think we'll settle down for a while.
Pankraz
	I've put you through enough. It's time you had a bit of fun, don't you think?
Pankraz
	Right, then! Let's be off!
*: 
	Have a good trip, Pankraz!
Pankraz
	I am Pankraz Gotha of Whealbrook.
Pankraz
	I've been summoned by King James, and am on my way to Coburg Castle at his request. Please allow me to pass!
Checkpoint Charlie
	Ah! So you're Pankraz, are you?
Checkpoint Charlie
	I had word that you'd be coming. Please pass on through!
Pankraz
	We'll be in the Kingdom of Coburg before long, %a000090.
Pankraz
	People say the view of the river from up top is quite something.
Pankraz
	Come on! We don't have much time, but it'll be fun to go and have a look.
Pankraz
	Here we are. Let's see...
Pankraz
	Erm... I hope you don't mind my asking, but are you alright there, old man?
*: 
	Oh yes. Don't mind me. I'm just watching the river go by and thinking about what the future holds for our kingdom.
Pankraz
	I see... Well, be careful not to catch a cold from standing up here too long.
Pankraz
	Do excuse us!
Pankraz
	We must hurry! We're supposed to be in Coburg by now!
*: 
	Halt!
	What business do you have in Coburg Castle?
Pankraz
	My name is Pankraz. I was summoned from Whealbrook by the King.
*: 
	Ah! My apologies, good sir.
	The King is expecting you.
*: 
	Please, follow me.
*: 
	Your Majesty!
	Pankraz of Whealbrook requests an audience.
King of Coburg
	Thank you. I will see him.
	You may leave.
*: 
	At once, Your Majesty!
King of Coburg
	Well, Pankraz. Your reputation precedes you.
	I have heard much about your bravery.
King of Coburg
	As such, I have summoned you here to ask you a favour...
	I, er... Ahem!
King of Coburg
	Please, approach the throne.
	Guards, dismissed!
Pankraz
	It'll be incredibly dull for you just standing there, %a000090.
Pankraz
	I'm sure His Majesty wouldn't mind if you looked around the castle. It's a fine opportunity for you.
Pankraz
	We'll have finished our discussion by the time you get back.
King of Coburg
	So this is the son of the brave Pankraz?
	Hm, you have your father's eyes, boy.
	Good, honest eyes.
*: 
	These are His Majesty's personal
	chambers, lad.
*: 
	If you want a place to play, you'll have to look elsewhere.
*: 
	Ah, there's nothing like the breeze up here on top of the castle! It almost sends...you...to sleep...
*: 
	Argh! I've had about as much of Prince Harry's mischief as I can take!
*: 
	The Goddess only knows what kind of a king that little rascal will make! The worry keeps me awake at night.
*: 
	I wonder what's so secret about the favour the King's asking your father.
*: 
	Maybe he's hoping he can knock some sense into Prince Harry!
*: 
	So you and your father come from Whealbrook, do you?
*: 
	I, I feel sure I've seen him somewhere before...
	In a castle, was it...? No, it must just be my imagination.
*: 
	This is Her Majesty the Queen Consort's bedchamber. She and her son, Prince Wilbur,
	both sleep in here.
Queen Consort
	Who are you? You'd like to make friends with a real prince, would you? Ah ha hah!
Queen Consort
	Well, you certainly have a shrewd eye for one so young.
Queen Consort
	That's right, my Wilbur would be a far more suitable successor to the throne than that naughty half-brother of his!
Queen Consort
	That's what you were thinking, wasn't it? Yes, you're very shrewd. Very shrewd indeed, my boy.
Prince Wilbur
	I don't want to be king!
Prince Harry
	Hmph. Who are you?
	Ah! I know, I know!
Prince Harry
	You're the son of Pankraz, the man my father ordered to come here from Whealbrook.
Prince Harry
	I'm the Prince of Coburg. The next in line to the throne! I expect you want to serve me by being my lackey, do you?
Prince Harry
	Hah! What sort of a prince would want a puny little boy like you as a lackey? Get out of my sight!
Prince Harry
	Sorry? I didn't quite catch that.
	What did you say?
*: 
	Wondering who the next king will be, are you? Prince Harry or Prince Wilbur?
*: 
	Well unless something happens to stop it, it'll be Prince Harry. He's the oldest son.
*: 
	I don't like all this talk about who's going to succeed to the throne. His Majesty the King is still in excellent health!
*: 
	There are far more pressing concerns. Like these rumours about children being kidnapped all over the place, hm.
*: 
	You should be careful, lad. Don't go wandering off without your father, alright?
*: 
	What should I do...?
*: 
	Her Majesty the Queen Consort has been meeting with some very unsavoury characters recently.
*: 
	I feel compelled to inform His Majesty the King, but...perhaps I shouldn't be meddling in Her Majesty's affairs...
*: 
	What's happened to your father, lad?
	You can't just go wandering off out of the castle on your own, you know.
*: 
	Ow... This bump on my head's killing me...
	Why does Prince Harry find flicking people so amusing? It's not funny. It hurts!
*: 
	Do you know the tale about the great castle that fell from the sky a long, long time ago?
*: 
	According to the legend, it was from that moment on that monsters started to prey on us humans again.
*: 
	Do you believe in legends, child?
*: 
	Only the Goddess on high in her infinite wisdom knows the truth.
*: 
	Everyone says what a naughty little boy young Harry is, but I don't think so.
*: 
	It's only 'cos he lost his mother so young. I mean, I know he's got the Queen Consort now, but...
*: 
	Well, it's not the same as your real mum now, is it?
*: 
	And anyway, she dotes on that Wilbur of hers like there's no tomorrow, so it's no wonder Harry's gone off the rails a bit, is it?
*: 
	Oh, you must be Prince Harry's new playmate.
	You poor thing!
*: 
	Aaaaaaaah!
*: 
	Phew! You scared the life out of me!
	I thought it was Prince Harry again.
*: 
	He knows I hate frogs, but he still puts them down my back. Just 'cos he's a prince, he thinks it's okay to be mean!
King of Coburg
	Ah, Pankraz's boy!
	Yes, you've a keen eye, lad. I can see that.
King of Coburg
	Well, I've entrusted your father with looking after my eldest son, Prince Harry.
King of Coburg
	I want you to make friends with him too.
	It'll do him good to have someone to play with.
Pankraz
	Ah, there you are, %a000090. The King's asked me to look after his son, Prince Harry.
Pankraz
	I'd feel much happier if I could keep a closer eye on him, but it seems he's not too fond of me.
Pankraz
	Why don't you try to make friends with him, %a000090? You're about the same age. I'm sure you'll get on.
Pankraz
	I'll stay out here so I can be sure he doesn't go anywhere while you go in and play with him, okay?
Pankraz
	That's my boy!
Prince Harry
	Oh, no! Not you again!
	I suppose you've come back because you want to be my lackey, have you?
Prince Harry
	Well, you're probably not up to it, but I'm prepared to give you one chance.
Prince Harry
	There's a chest in the room next door with a lackey's badge in it. Go and get it!
Prince Harry
	You must have a badge if you want to be my lackey. Otherwise I won't let you.
Prince Harry
	Good! Because I wouldn't let you, anyway!
	Now go away!
Pankraz
	What's the matter, %a000090?
	What!? Prince Harry's disappeared!?
Pankraz
	But this is the only way out of that room, and he didn't come past me.
Pankraz
	Are you sure? Come along, show me.
Prince Harry
	Pankraz! I thought I ordered you to stay out of my room!
Pankraz
	Phew! You really don't like me, do you?
	So sorry, Your Highness.
Pankraz
	You must have been daydreaming, %a000090.
	The Prince hasn't gone anywhere, has he?
Pankraz
	I know it's hard, but try to make friends with him, will you?
Prince Harry
	So, you've brought the lackey's badge like I told you to, I presume?
Prince Harry
	Oh, really? Alright, then, show it to me.
	Hah! You were lying! You don't have it at all!
Prince Harry
	What? There's nothing in the chest?
	Don't be absurd! Of course there is!
Prince Harry
	I simply won't accept a lackey who doesn't have a lackey's badge. Go and look properly this time, you nincompoop!
Pankraz
	What's the matter, %a000090? Hm?
	The Prince has disappeared again?
Pankraz
	Are you absolutely sure? He didn't come past me.
Pankraz
	Did you check his room properly? Behind all the furniture, as well?
	Shall I come and look with you?
Pankraz
	Alright, then. Follow me.
Pankraz
	I know it's hard, but please try to make friends with the Prince, %a000090. For me.
~ %0%a000090 moves the chair aside and searches underneath it. ~
~ There's a secret staircase leading down! ~
Prince Harry
	How dare you discover my secret staircase!?
	Hmph! I didn't like you the moment I had the misfortune of laying eyes on you!
Prince Harry
	But I bet you didn't find the lackey's badge, did you? Well you can't be my lackey then. So there!
Prince Harry
	Hm? What's that?
*: 
	You Prince 'Arry?
Prince Harry
	No, I'm Prince Harry. With an aitch, you imbecile!
	And who are you filthy louts?
*: 
	Filfy wots!? Sorry mate, but you're comin'
	wiv us!
Prince Harry
	Urgh!
*: 
	Oi, step on it!
	Get 'im on the raft!
*: 
	Comin', guv!
*: 
	I heard a bit of a commotion from the far side of the castle just now...
*: 
	If you've gone and got yourself in trouble, lad, you'd better go and own up to your father, not me!
*: 
	Your father just shot out of the castle like a rocket. I wonder what's...
*: 
	Oh, I know! I bet Prince Harry got him with one of his tricks! Ha ha ha! Poor fellow!
*: 
	You and your father like travelling, don't you?
*: 
	This globe here was made by a great adventurer. Have a look at it. Maybe you'll recognise a place or two!
Pankraz
	What on earth's the matter, %a000090?
	What!? Prince Harry's been kidnapped!?
Pankraz
	Dear Goddess!
Pankraz
	Now listen to me, %a000090. No one must know of this. It'd be a disaster if people were to find out.
Pankraz
	We'll have to rescue the Prince before he's missed. Come on! Follow me now!
*: 
	Welcome to Coburg.
*: 
	I heard there's a really big ruin north-east of here.
*: 
	But my mum said I mustn't go there.
	She said it's too dangerous.
*: 
	Hello there. Well, it's your lucky day!
	I'm a travelling salesman, you know.
*: 
	Ruff! Ruff, ruff!
~ %0%a000090 tries to read the sign... ~
~ But he hasn't actually learnt how to read yet! ~
*: 
	Usually I travel about buying and selling stuff, you know. But the monsters I've been running into lately are so tough.
*: 
	I hope it doesn't mean anything. I'd hate to think there was trouble brewing.
