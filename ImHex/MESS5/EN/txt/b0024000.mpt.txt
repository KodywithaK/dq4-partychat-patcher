Rodrigo Briscoletti
	So you know your charge.
	I want a strict watch kept night and day!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	And if anything happens, don't hang about
	finishing your cappuccino before you report
	back to me, capice?
*: 
	%0%a000090! Have you seen Mr Briscoletti?
	He's been waiting for you at La Guardia.
*: 
	Welcome to Mostroferrato, ancient stronghold of the Briscoletti family.
*: 
	You'll never guess what I found! There's a funny pot in a shrine to the west of Stockenbarrel that's glowing an eerie red colour!
*: 
	When I told Mr Briscoletti about it, he turned as white as a sheet and said something like,
	ⓗFor the love of linguine!ⓘ
*: 
	I hope I haven't said something I shouldn't have...
	Oops.
*: 
	No, surely not!
	It's...%a000090, isn't it?
*: 
	That's one face I could never forget, no matter how many years go by.
*: 
	So have you seen Mr Briscoletti already?
*: 
	He's been acting really strangely recently.
	And he looks terrible too.
Bingo
	Aaarf! Bau bau bau!
*: 
	Urgh. I drank far too much last night.
	Hair of the dog's the only answer!
	Glug, glug, glug, glug...
*: 
	Urgh! (burp)
*: 
	I hate the daytime. There's no atmosphere
	during the day.
*: 
	Mr Briscoletti's in here quite a bit these days,
	you know.
*: 
	It's funny, because he never used to show his face in the pub at all.
*: 
	Well, well! Young %a000090!
	How are you?
*: 
	It seems like yesterday that you were getting married, you know.
*: 
	Good Goddess! Surely I'm looking at your offspring, aren't I? You can't mistake those eyes!
*: 
	Is that you, %a000090?
	You look even tougher than I remember.
*: 
	And you're a father now!
	Well done, my boy!
*: 
	Yes, congratulations, congratulations!
*: 
	Two people from different upbringings, joining as man and wife, setting off on a new journey together as a family...
*: 
	When I think about it, marriage is another example of the many wonders the Goddess has bestowed upon us all.
*: 
	Stop lazing about and put some tea on,
	you old waster!
*: 
	Oh! You're not my wife!
	I, I do apologise.
*: 
	You've got to treat them mean to keep them keen, you know! Ha ha ha ha hah!
*: 
	Did you know my husband was such a strong man? I had no idea.
*: 
	I've fallen in love with him all over again!
Crispin
	............!
	It can't be...can it?
Crispin
	It is you, %a000090! It feels like years and years since I last saw you.
Crispin
	We're always talking about you, though. You made a big impression back then.
Crispin
	Oh, yes! I should introduce you, shouldn't I?
	This is my wife, Nera! Heh heh.
Nera
	It's wonderful to see you again after all this time, %a000090. How are you?
Nera
	It's really thanks to you that Crispin and I fell in love in the first place, you know.
Nera
	We're so happy together.
Nera
	Everything's just perfect. Except...
Crispin
	Except Nera's father, Mr Briscoletti.
	He seems a bit off just recently.
Crispin
	He's always on edge. He never seems to be able to relax any more.
Nera
	Would you mind talking to him? I'm sure he'd open up to you. He always really liked you.
Crispin
	Yes, would you mind?
	As a favour to us?
Crispin
	Perhaps you could find out what it is that's bothering him and maybe help him get over it.
Crispin
	............!

Crispin
	Oh, yes! I should introduce you, shouldn't I?
	This is my wife, Ashlee!
Ashlee
	ⓗEllo, %a000090. It is such a plaisir to meet you at last. My 'usband 'as told me so much about you.
	Tee hee hee!
Crispin
	Ashlee used to be a famous dancer, you know, amongst other things.
Crispin
	The way she moves is hypnotic... And she does the most amazing...
Crispin
	Oh, dear! Sorry! I get a bit carried away sometimes.
	But that's hardly appropriate conversation now.
Crispin
	Actually, there's something bothering me at the moment you might be able to help with.
	It's Mr Briscoletti. He's behaving really strangely.
Crispin
	He's always on edge. He never seems to be able to relax any more.

	Welcome to the Briscoletti residence.
Romana
	%0%a000090!
	You've come back to visit us?
	How wonderful it is to see you!
Romana
	The Goddess has been watching over us all.
Romana
	But there is one thing you could help me with, %a000090.
Romana
	My husband has been behaving very oddly ever since he spoke to a travelling merchant who came to town a few days ago.
Romana
	But he just won't tell me what's bothering him.
	I'm starting to worry about him...

	I'm starting to worry about him...
*: 
	Please, %a000090, sir. I... I couldn't help overhearing Mr Briscoletti talking to himself before.
*: 
	He said something about a jar, and that if it was glowing red, some monster or other would come back to life!
*: 
	He was standing by the bookshelf in the living
	room. It sounded like he was reading some old
	diary or the like.
*: 
	I'm worried he's in trouble, you see.
	You'll help him though, won't you, %a000090?
~ ⓗYou are reading my diary, the diary of Rodolfo Briscoletti. What I write here is of utmost importance. It must never be lost. ~
~ ⓗJust a short time ago, I succeeded in sealing away a giant beast in a jar. ~
~ ⓗA beast so gigantic, his head pierced the clouds and scratched the heavens. ~
~ ⓗLeft unchecked, he would have destroyed not only our village, but the entire world. ~
~ ⓗBut the seal will not last forever. Perhaps one hundred years... One hundred and fifty at best... ~
~ ⓗWhen the jar loses its sacred powers, it will begin to glow red. And when it does, the beast will be free once more! ~
~ ⓗTo my as yet unborn grandchildren and grandchildren's grandchildren, good luck! ~
~ ⓗI have decided to make a bambino with my wife, so that I can pass on this warning to the world that follows me. ~
~ ⓗAnd to those of my heirs unlucky enough to be born one hundred and fifty years after myself, I pray for you.                                             R. Briscoletti.ⓘ ~

Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Holy rigatoni! %0%a000090, you old scaramouch!
	When did you get back?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	N-Never mind. There'll be plenty of time for all that bologna later.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Right now, I need you to do me a favour.
	I can rely on you, I presume?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	There's a small island to the west of Stockenbarrel. That's the village just north of here, if youⓚⓛ
	Are you listening?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	So anyway, on that small island to the west of Stockenbarrel, there's an equally small shrine.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Inside the shrine is an old jar.
	That's all. Just that one, small jar.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I need you to go there and give me a bulletin on what colour the jar is.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I realise the request might sound a little cavalier, but it's really very important.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	And if the jar's red, don't waste any time getting back here. Capice? You must hurry.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I just hope this has all been some terrible misunderstanding...
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Well, I suppose time can turn any man's heart to stone...
Rodrigo Briscoletti

	In fact, I think you went there for me once before, didn't you? I asked you to tell me what colour the jar inside was, if you remember.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Well I need you to go there again and give me another bulletin on what colour it is now.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I realise the request might sound a little cavalier, but it's really very important.

Rodrigo Briscoletti
	What!? You won't even hear what the favour is?
	From your own father-in-law?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I won't have my daughter married to a useless buffone, %a000090!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You would never have had my bambina's
	hand in marriage in the first place were it
	not for my consent!
*: 
	What are you doing out and about at this
	time of night?
*: 
	If I mistake you for a monster and slash you down, don't come complaining. You won't have
	a leg to stand on. Ha ha ha!
Bingo
	Au au au...

	You'll never guess what I found! There's a funny pot in a shrine to the west of Stockenbarrel that's glowing an eerie red colour!

	Mr Briscoletti's in here quite a bit these days,

*: 
	It's funny, because he never used to show his face in the pub at all.

	Phew! You're travelling with a stunner there,
	my friend! Hic!

	What? You're mirⓚⓛ You're merriⓚⓛ You're married!? You luckyⓚⓛ Hiccup!
*: 
	Ah-phew, ah-phew.
*: 
	Have you heard about that glowing red jar the travelling salesman's been talking about?
*: 
	I've seen it too, as it goes. Only it wasn't glowing when I saw it. It was just a normal-looking jar.
*: 
	No? Where have you been?
*: 
	You wanna listen to what people say a bit more, or you'll end up paying for it.
*: 
	When everyone's down in the dumps about all the bad stuff that's going on, it ⓚⓛ Hic! ⓚⓛ makes for a pretty depressing evening.
*: 
	What? What bad stuff? Well, there's the evil darkness that's ⓚⓛ Hic! ⓚⓛ going to swallow up the whole world for starters...
*: 
	But that White King's Paradise sounds too good to be ⓚⓛ Hic! ⓚⓛ true if you ask me. D'you think you'd really be saved there? Hiccup.

	Ah-phew, ah-phew...
*: 
	Ah-phew, ah-phew...

	Ah-phew... Ah-phew...
*: 
	My poor husband's completely exhausted.
*: 
	Better let him rest.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ha ha ha hah! Ha ha ha ha hah!
	Tutti-frutti! Tutti-frutti!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Just as I finish getting ready, the battle is finito! You defeated the beast already.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Fine work, %a000090!
	Tutti-frutti indeed!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I like you more and more, you ripe young ragazzo!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You and your family will do well on your quest, I've no doubt. And my best wishes go with you!
Romana
	It's wonderful that you've managed to have children of your own.
Romana
	Can I tell you something, %a000090?
	Just having children doesn't make you a parent,
	you know.
Romana
	We learn from our little ones, and bit by bit we develop into true parents.
Romana
	There's no need for you to worry, though.
	I've no doubt you'll make a wonderful father.
*: 
	Thank you, %a000090, for helping us.
*: 
	It's such a relief to see Mr Briscoletti looking cheerful again.
*: 
	And it's great that people in town didn't have to suffer. Most of them hardly know anything about what happened.

	Welcome, %a000090. Come in and relax, won't you?

Romana
	It's wonderful that you've managed to have children of your own.
Romana
	Oh! Does that...make me a grandmama?
Romana
	Well! That's wonderful. It's...just a bit unexpected,
	I suppose. I don't quite know how to feel.

	Mr Briscoletti has a wonderful son-in-law.
	Defeating a giant beast like that barely before setting foot in the hallway.

	It's such a relief to see Mr Briscoletti looking cheerful again.

	And it's great that people in town didn't have to suffer. Most of them hardly know anything about what happened.

	Welcome home, sir.

	And welcome home, Ms %a001230.
*: 
	There's a lot of laughter coming from the Briscoletti residence now.
*: 
	Looks like whatever the problem was has been cleared up now. That's good news.
*: 
	Have you been to the shrine north-west of here?
*: 
	Ever since what happened before, I've been a bit worried about it, so I keep going to check up on the jar there.
*: 
	The last time I went, it was rattling and jumping about all over the place.
*: 
	I'm worried something bad's going to happen again.
*: 
	Did you feel that tremor just now?
	It was a really strong one.
*: 
	It felt almost like some giant creature plodding on its way to battle.
*: 
	What? Mr Briscoletti's back to his usual, cheerful self, you say?
*: 
	Oh. Well, that's one less customer for me then.
*: 
	Mind you, he never really looked at home in
	a pub, anyway.
Crispin
	I see...
	So the monster was sealed away one hundred and fifty years ago.
Crispin
	I suppose to the monster itself, it probably felt like just a few days had passed or something.
Crispin
	So it wouldn't have realised that Mr Briscoletti's great, great, great, great...
	Ahem! How many greats was that?
Crispin
	Well anyway, it wouldn't have realised that
	Mr Briscoletti's forefather, Rodolfo, passed
	away years and years ago.
Nera
	Thank you. For helping my father, and for
	saving the town.

	I'll pray for you all, that the Goddess watches over you as you go on your way.

*: 
	I reckon there was a monster or something in that jar at the shrine.
*: 
	It's gotta have been, right? I mean, it was glowing red and everything.
*: 
	I'm sorry, sir. Everyone in the house has already retired for the night.
*: 
	You must be exhausted being up at such a late hour, sir. I hope you have a good night's sleep.

	You've finally come to realise that you should've picked me when you had the chance, I suppose?
Debora
	Well it's too late. Unless you can just flick a switch and replay the adventures of your life. No doubt you once confessed your love for me in church...?
Debora
	If you don't want anything, then don't bother me with your whiny voice.

Debora
	Wasn't I bothered by all the commotion outside?
Debora
	As far as I can see, it was nothing. I don't know what in the world everyone was so het up about.
Debora
	So...this is your offspring, I suppose?
Debora
	Hmph. Wimp begets wimp.
Debora
	I suppose that makes me an aunt, doesn't it?
Debora
	But I don't want to be called auntie, got it?
	Make sure your kids call me Signorina Debora.
	Yes, beautiful Signorina Debora!
Debora
	Don't bother trying to hide it. The similarity
	is uncanny.
Debora
	If you don't want anything, then don't bother me with your whiny voice.
Nera
	Thank you. For helping my father, and for

Nera
	I'll pray that the Goddess watches over you all as you go on your way.
Nera
	Tell me, how is my sister?
	I hope she's well.
Nera
	You could ask her to come and visit once in a while. I'd like to see her.
Nera
	I, I'd heard that you had children, but...
	Is this...?
Nera
	I knew it! You look so alike!
Nera
	I can't believe it, though. Children grow up so fast...
Nera
	Time passes so quickly, doesn't it?
Nera
	Really? But there's such a striking resemblance.
Nera
	Tell me the truth now, %a000090. You do have children, don't you?
Nera
	Thank you. For helping my father, and for
	saving the town.
Nera
	I'll pray for you all, that the Goddess watches over you as you go on your way.
Nera
	Don't be a stranger, Debora. Come and visit us from time to time, won't you?
Nera
	Mama and Papa would never admit it, but they really worry about you, you know.
Debora
	Alright, alright. I get the picture, Nera.
	I'll drop in sometime if the mood takes me.
Debora
	If you're tired already, I suppose it'd be okay for you to have a rest here. Well? Do you want to?
Debora
	Alright. But the bed's far too narrow for two.
	You can sleep on the floor.
Debora
	You're awake now, are you?
	Right then, let's get going.
Debora
	Just so long as you're not too tired. I don't want you collapsing while we're travelling. I could really damage my nails dragging you to an inn.

	Whatever could it be that Mr Briscoletti's so afraid of, I wonder.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ah, you came.
	...Wait a minute! Why isn't %a000090 with you?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I need %a000090 too.
	Bring him here now!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ah, you're here at last, %a000090.
	I see... The jar was red, was it?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You need not be a fortune-teller to know that from the expression on your face. I'm afraid that confirms my worst fears.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	We have very little time, then. Come!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	The gargantuan beast within the jar is about to come back to life.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	One hundred and fifty years ago, my great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather...
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	...in other words, one of my revered ancestors, sealed it away in the jar, like meat inside ravioli.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	But the seal is about to break.
	The pasta is about to burst open!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	And the beast will no doubt embark on a vendetta.
	He will be after blood. My blood!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	After that you can be sure he will turn his
	fury on Mostroferrato!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I must return home and make preparations
	for battle.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I need you to remain on watch here until
	I return, %a000090!

Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ah, you're alright, %a000090?
	I had an uneasy feeling, so I hurried back here.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	What!? The beast has already surfaced?
	You fought Bjørn?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	It's happening faster than I feared!
	I must speed the battle plans along.
	You can manage here, I trust?
Bjørn

*: 
	A warm and windy welcome to Zoomingale!
*: 
	Professor Toilen Trubble must still be in bed. You can tell when he's up and about, 'cos there's always smoke comin' out of his chimney.
*: 
	He works too hard, I reckon. He's busy with that research of his all day long. It's too much for a man his age.
*: 
	Have you heard? Apparently, the world is about to be swallowed up by darkness.
*: 
	And only people who are followers of the Order of Zugzwang will be saved.
*: 
	I'm not too sure about that Order of Zugzwang.
*: 
	This is just a rumour, but...
*: 
	Well, I heard that lots of people were forced into slavery some years back to build that temple of theirs, the Crocodilopolis.
*: 
	Ooh, what good timing!
*: 
	I have something great to sell to you if you're interested. It's a book by the great Korol, leader of the Order of Zugzwang.
*: 
	And it could be yours for just three thousand gold coins! So, do you want to buy it?
*: 
	Here we are, then. Korol's Catechism is all yours!
~ %0%a000120 receives Korol's Catechism! ~
~ %0%a000180 acquires Korol's Catechism! ~
*: 
	The Order of Zugzwang is sure to bring peace back to our world. We must all have faith!
*: 
	Oh! I was sure you'd want it. It's for your own good, after all.
*: 
	Oh dear! It looks like you can't afford it,
	I'm afraid.
*: 
	Oh no! I'm lost yet again!
*: 
	No matter how many times I come to this town,
	I just can't seem to find my way around.
*: 
	There's no better feeling than the breeze that blows here.
*: 
	I wish I could just stay here
	and soak it up forever.

*: 
	Them was right! These city inns is much 'n' more sophistimicated than what we got in the country.
*: 
	Don't be gawkin' at everythin' like a proper daft'un! Just keep cold an' they'll never know we'm not from 'round these parts.
*: 
	According to ancient legend, there's a tower somewhere that leads right up into the heavens.
*: 
	It's not clear whether it still exists, mind you.
*: 
	It don't look like the pub's open yet.
	Uhh, I need a drink!
*: 
	Heh heh! About time too!
	Hurry up and gimme a drink, will ya?
*: 
	Eh? You don't work 'ere?
	Crikey! Sorry!
*: 
	Right then, looks like I'm ready
	for another night of serving.
*: 
	Hm? Zoomshine? Ooh, no. We don't stock that!
	No one in their right mind would drink it.
*: 
	I beg your pardon? You have some Zoomshine of your own, you say?
*: 
	Oh, I see. Professor Toilen Trubble gave you some, did he?
*: 
	I'm sure he must've explained the delicate nature of the situation to you, then.
*: 
	It's imperative that you keep Zoomshine's tastiness to yourself and don't tell any outsiders.
*: 
	Ah-phew, ah-phew...
*: 
	That son of mine is a worry and a half.
*: 
	It's going to be a long time before I see any grandchildren at this rate, that's for sure.
*: 
	Yum yum!
*: 
	I seem to be putting on a bit of weight just lately, but never mind that!
*: 
	Nothing makes people happier than
	tucking into some tasty food, I say!
*: 
	Everything else is just by the by, in my opinion.
*: 
	I sense of late that the power of darkness is growing stronger.
*: 
	Somewhere in this world, the doors to the underworld, Nadiria...
*: 
	Those doors will be broken by Grandmaster Nimzo, or the legendary hero will pass through them to the other side.
*: 
	Then it will just be a race against time.
*: 
	Talkin' of legends, have you heard of the local brew, Zoomshine?
*: 
	Oh, right. You young travellers certainly know your stuff then, eh?
*: 
	It's been around for about a hundred years now. ⓗLife is but a drinkⓘ, that's what those who know about it say.
*: 
	It's such potent stuff that it even has the power to frighten monsters away!
*: 
	You can't buy it at the pub any more. It's pretty much impossible to get hold of nowadays.
*: 
	Yay! Yay!
*: 
	Shh! Just try to be patient.
*: 
	You mustn't cause a fuss in church, dear!
*: 
	Bang! Bang! That's the sound of a good piece of armour being made!
*: 
	You there! If you're after some fantastic
	armour, come back to my shop at night
	and check out my stock!
Professor Toilen Trubble
	(cough cough)
	Hm? A visitor?
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Sorry, but I'm in rather a bad way. I won't be needing a research assistant any more.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	I wonder what became of that young lad who helped me revive the Zoom spell all those years ago.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	(cough cough)
	Hm? Oh! It's you, %a000090!
Professor Toilen Trubble
	I knew you'd be back one day.
	I've been waiting for you.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	(cough cough)
	I've finally managed to revive another ancient spell.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	It's a bit of an awkward one, but I'm sure you'll be able to make it work.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Aaah! Now then...
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Listen carefully. The spell is called...
	Ho㈢cus ㈢Po㈢cus!
Professor Toilen Trubble
	If you use this spell during battle, something very interesting will happen.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	The thing is, I'm not sure what! So you'd better be a little bit careful about when you use it.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	I'm feeling a bit worn out now, I'm afraid.
	Aaah...
Professor Toilen Trubble
	(cough cough)
	I should know who you folk are.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	I didn't do all my research into ancient spells for nothing, you know.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	I just hope it will be of some use to you...
Professor Toilen Trubble
	(cough cough)
	I should know who you folk are.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	I didn't do all my research into ancient spells for nothing, you know.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	I just hope it will be of some use to you...
Professor Toilen Trubble
	I almost forgot! I wanted to celebrate reviving that old spell with you.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	I've been saving it for you especially...
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Here it is! A bottle of the legendary Zoomshine.
	Now you can find out for yourself if life really is but a drink!
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Hm? What is it? You look rather troubled.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Oh! I see. You've been taken in by what the townspeople told you, have you? Ha ha ha!
Professor Toilen Trubble
	Zoomshine is a very precious local brew only to be found in Zoomingale. And it tastes just wonderful!
Professor Toilen Trubble
	But it takes a terribly long time to make it, and there's barely a drop of it around nowadays.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	If outsiders found out about it and demand spread, it would be chaos, you see.
Professor Toilen Trubble
	So that's why we all fib a little. We don't
	mean anything bad by it. Here you are,
	anyway. This one's yours!

*: 
	Meow?
*: 
	I should feel like the cat that got the cream now that Professor Toilen Trubble's garden isn't smoky any more.
*: 
	But now I'm so purrturbed to see the old man in bed all the time that I just can't enjoy it.
*: 
	I feel better now I've got it off my whiskers and confided in you, though.
*: 
	Let me tell you something
	purrtinent by way of thanks.
*: 
	All over the world, there are special regional items purrculiar to each location.
*: 
	If you travel around a lot, you should try
	to collect them. Then you'll be like the cat
	that got the cream!
*: 
	Meow...
*: 
	A warm and windy welcome to Zoomingale!
*: 
	As long as I'm with her, all of my worries are blown away in an instant.
*: 
	This must be love...
*: 
	Oh no! Not another dead end!
*: 
	No matter how many times I come to this town,
	I just can't seem to find my way around.
*: 
	I just can't get used to this fancy pillow.
	Give me my old hay bale any day of the week.
*: 
	Oo-ar-phew...
*: 
	Dear Goddess! How could you abandon us in this way? (sob)
*: 
	Another drink, please, miss!
	Amen to that... Hic!
*: 
	I'm afraid the priest's a bit
	worse for wear again tonight.
*: 
	I'm not too sure about that Order of Zugzwang.
*: 
	This is just a rumour, but...
*: 
	Well, I heard that lots of people were forced into slavery some years back to build that temple of theirs, the Crocodilopolis.
*: 
	Zzzz...
*: 
	According to ancient legend, there's a tower somewhere that leads right up into the heavens.
*: 
	There are some rather nasty rumours going around about the Order of Zugzwang.
*: 
	I've got a lot more faith in
	the legendary hero, myself.
*: 
	Hey! Don't put me off my stride!
*: 
	I'm about to start my song.
*: 
	A one two...
*: 
	Oh! I just can't seem to get to sleep!
*: 
	Ah-phew, ah-phew...
*: 
	ZZZZ! ARGH-PHEW!
*: 
	How's a woman supposed to get a decent night's sleep with that snoring going on!? I'm exhausted!
*: 
	Aaah! This is heaven!
*: 
	You can't beat a nice, cool drink just
	after you get out of the bath.
*: 
	Everything else is just by the by, in my opinion.
*: 
	What? This is Zoomshine!?
*: 
	That's absurd! I wouldn't drink something that disgusting, surely...!? Ha ha ha!
*: 
	Wait a minute! Isn't that a bottle of Zoomshine you've got right there?
*: 
	So you know the truth, then.
	Well, I didn't see that coming!
*: 
	Zzz... Zzz...
*: 
	Ah-phew...
	No outsiders can know... Zzzz...
*: 
	After some weapons, are ya, mate? Then you'd better come back durin' the day.
*: 
	I just rent this place of a night, see.
