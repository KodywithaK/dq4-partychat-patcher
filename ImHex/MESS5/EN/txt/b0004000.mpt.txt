*: 
	Hey! Stop your dawdling!
	Hurry up and get that rock moved!
*: 
	Oi! Stop yer slackin'! It'll be a whippin' for you if you don't move the next rock a bit smartish.
*: 
	What's that look on your face?
*: 
	Slaves are supposed to have eyes like the dead!
*: 
	You make me sick!
	Get back to work!
~ There's a large wheel turning as the slaves walk. ~
*: 
	Ohhh... That wretched Order of Zugzwang...
	Before they came along, we were just peacefully getting on with our lives.
*: 
	Now we have no freedom whatsoever. They won't even let us carry on worshipping the Goddess.
*: 
	Haah...haah...
*: 
	Don't slow me down, mate.
	I don't want a whipping.
*: 
	Ugh! How many more rocks do we have to move before we can get a rest?
*: 
	Haah...haah... I reckon we need to move at least another thousand rocks before they let us rest.
*: 
	I'm the water girl. Can I offer 
	you a drink, handsome?
*: 
	Here you are.
*: 
	Okay. Just come and find me
	when you get thirsty, then.
*: 
	Come on! Get movin'!
*: 
	I'll have to smash your face in with this rock if you don't get back to work!
*: 
	Get these bags of stones carried upstairs! The leader of the Order is getting impatient for the temple to be finished.
*: 
	Keep working! Keep working!
	Work until you drop dead for all I care!
*: 
	For mother's sake...
	Yaaah!
*: 
	Chip away, chip away, chip away some more...
*: 
	..................
~ There's no response. ~
~ He doesn't seem to be in the mood to chat. ~
*: 
	Haah... Haah... Maybe I should marry a soldier.
	Maybe then I wouldn't have to be a slave any more.
*: 
	Haah... Haah...
*: 
	Haah... Haah...
*: 
	Haah... Haah...
	Don't get in my way!
*: 
	It's a disgrace, I say! It's just pure evil to force a poor old man like me to carry heavy sacks about like this.
*: 
	You're not plotting another escape bid, are you? You can count me out this time if you are.
*: 
	I still haven't recovered properly from the whipping I got when they caught me the last time.
*: 
	Haah... Haah...
*: 
	..................
~ There's no response. ~
~ He doesn't seem to be in the mood to chat. ~
*: 
	Haah... Haah...
*: 
	Please... Don't talk to me now...
	I'm just too tired.
~ She looks like she's really struggling. ~
~ It might be best not to disturb her. ~
*: 
	There's going to be a big statue here of the deity that the Order of Zugzwang worship.
*: 
	That probably means they'll end up destroying those stairs leading down just there.
*: 
	I reckon they'll do away with us as soon as the whole thing's finished too.
*: 
	We have to find a way to escaⓚⓛ
	Oops! I must keep my voice down!
*: 
	This isn't good enough! We need more rocks!
*: 
	Ha ha ha. You slaves are lucky, lucky people.
*: 
	What better way to spend your entire lives than working to build the exalted White King's Paradise?
*: 
	It must be more than twenty years now since I was first made a slave.
*: 
	And you were just a young boy when you were brought here.
*: 
	It can't have been an easy childhood for you, eh?
*: 
	Keep working! Keep working!
	Working is the key to happiness!
*: 
	Hurgh... Hurgh...
	It's too heavy. I can't move it.
*: 
	This is just between you and me, but...
*: 
	When the temple is finished, our great ruler says he will set all of you slaves free.
*: 
	Naturally there's a condition, which is that you all become followers of the Order of Zugzwang, but that's no hardship.
Harry
	Look out, %a000090! We can't loaf about here, otherwise we'll be in for another whipping.
Harry
	Or did you want to talk about yet another escape plan!? We've been stuck here for ten years already, after all.
Harry
	I still feel terrible about what
	happened to your father.
Harry
	I'm sure you took his last words to heart and you want to set about finding your mother.
Harry
	I envy you. There's nothing left for me out there.
	My brother will have been made king by now.
Harry
	Still, there's no use feeling sorry for myself.
	Better get back to work.
*: 
	What do you think you're doing!? Get back to your work area immediately!
*: 
	And don't even think for one second about trying to escape!
*: 
	What!? You want to help that geezer 'cos he's movin' rocks there all by himself?
*: 
	Ha ha ha! You've got a nerve! I'd shut up if I were you, else you'll soon regret tryin' to tell us how to run the place!
*: 
	Don't disturb me, mate.
*: 
	I'm the only one manning this bit, so I can't afford to waste any time.
*: 
	The leader of this place is saying stuff about saving the world.
*: 
	That's all well and good, but it doesn't justify destroying an ancient temple and forcing us folk to build a new one in its place.
*: 
	Would you like some water? You know, there are monsters around all over the place outside. At least we can feel safe here.
*: 
	And it's all thanks to the great ruler.
*: 
	Please. Please keep the noise down.
	This is my only chance for a rest.
Soldier
	This is terrible...
	They made my little sister Maria a slave.
Soldier
	I wish there was something I could do, but I can't possibly act against the great ruler.
Soldier
	Er, oh dear! I really shouldn't have said all that to one of the slaves!
~ It's an old grave. ~
~ There don't seem to be any new crosses here. ~
~ So what can have become of the slave that died ~
~ just the other day? ~
~ The jail door is locked shut. ~
*: 
	Damn it! Let me out of here!
	This cult tells nothing but lies!
~ The jail door is locked shut. ~
*: 
	Right! That's enough for today!
*: 
	Off to your cells, everyone.
	It'll be an early morning again tomorrow!
Harry
	Awake at last, are you, %a000090?
Harry
	You seemed a bit agitated. You weren't having another bad dream about being whipped, were you?
Harry
	You bring it on yourself most of the time, you know. We slaves have to keep our heads down if we want an easy life.
Harry
	...Who'd have thought I'd ever turn out to be the obedient one, eh? Ha ha ha!
~ The door won't open. It seems to be locked from the other side. ~
Harry
	It was your father's death that made me change my tune and become more serious and submissive.
Harry
	I can't believe it's been ten years already. Time flies when you're having fun, eh?
*: 
	Ugh, don't wake me up! I need every minute of sleep I can get!
*: 
	Morning, %a000090.
*: 
	I hear it's been ten years now since you were brought here as a kid and forced into slavery.
*: 
	Sounds like you've had a pretty tough time of it, eh? Poor thing.
*: 
	Yikes! Sorry! I won't slack off any more, I promise. Please don't whip me again!
*: 
	Zzzz...
*: 
	Ugh. This used to be our sacred place of worship before the Order of Zugzwang came along.
*: 
	I still have faith, though, even after all that's happened to us. I know we'll all be saved, I believe it in my heart.
*: 
	Have you heard the gossip? Apparently, when the temple is finished, we're all going to be set free.
*: 
	I've never heard such rubbish! You'd have to be a complete fool to believe that.
*: 
	It's just propaganda that they put about to make us work harder, that's all.
*: 
	But they said it's true...
*: 
	Honestly! There's no helping some people. Did they tell you ⓗgullibleⓘ has been removed from the dictionary too!?
*: 
	Hah, it's you! You're the one whose old man was killed by one of the people of this temple, eh?
*: 
	Y'know, you must never forget the pain you felt that day.
*: 
	It's strong feelings like that that make the difference between life and death here.
*: 
	I have to tell you something.
*: 
	See that girl over there, Maria? She was a follower of the Order, but then they made
	her into a slave.
*: 
	Something about her going against orders and trying to protect a child slave or suchlike.
*: 
	Her brother is a soldier for the Order as well, would you believe? I can't believe they'd treat her so harshly.
Maria
	I've, er...always found it a little bit difficult to get along with the Order's philosophies.
Maria
	So it's actually quite a good thing that I angered him and was made into a slave.
Maria
	Now I can see how so many people have been forced into working for the good of the Order.
Maria
	I've also heard talk that the Order of Zugzwang is being controlled by some kind of terrifying power.
Maria
	The question is, who's going to
	stand up and confront it?
~ %0%a000090 examines the pot. ~
~ Urgh! What a smell! It looks like it must be what the slaves use as their toilet! ~
~ %0%a000090 examines the pot. ~
~ There'll be no fixing this if it gets smashed. ~
~ It might be better not to throw it. ~
*: 
	Get to work! Or do you want to feel 
	my whip again?
*: 
	Not you again! You've certainly got some nerve, causing trouble all the time.
*: 
	Get out of my sight!
*: 
	This isn't your work area! Get to your correct position at once!
*: 
	The great ruler says that the era of darkness will soon be upon us.
*: 
	When the time comes, the Order of Zugzwang will save us all.
*: 
	We should all be eternally grateful
	for this blessing.
*: 
	You looking for someone? If it's Harry you're after, he's right down below. They moved him down there today.
*: 
	Will you really be freed when the temple is completed? Yes, of course you will!
*: 
	So just focus on that and put your back into your work, do you hear?
*: 
	I doubt I'll still be alive by the
	time this temple's finished.
*: 
	But at least they won't be able to whip me when I'm dead. My body and spirit will be free at last.
~ What a shock! One of the slave girls is being whipped! ~
*: 
	You stupid girl! How dare you make my shoes dirty!? You need some sense beating into you!
Maria
	I-I'm so sorry! Please forgive me!
*: 
	Never! You've only just become a slave,
	haven't you, girl?
*: 
	So maybe it's best that I hammer it home to you what your new life's going to be like!
Maria
	Aaargh...!
Harry
	Huh! That cretin!
*: 
	..................
~ There's no response. ~
~ He doesn't seem to be in the mood to chat. ~
*: 
	That poor girl, being whipped so much!
*: 
	This is terrible. Somebody should do something.
Harry
	Hey, %a000090! Where did you appear from all of a sudden?
Harry
	I don't think I can stand to watch this any longer.
*: 
	Yaah!
Harry
	I can't put up with this a minute longer!
	Come on, %a000090!
*: 
	Hey! You want a piece of the action too, do you? I'd be more than happy to oblige!
Maria
	You mustn't get involved like this! Please don't get yourselves into trouble on my account.
*: 
	Don't make a fuss, mate! They'll punish us all if you're not careful.
*: 
	You mustn't go against the establishment.
	Just keep your head down. That's the only way
	to survive this place.
*: 
	Oi! Nothin' to see here!
	Just get back to work!
Soldier
	What's going on here?
	What's all this fuss about?
*: 
	Huh! These two boys just came and attacked me for no reason!
Soldier
	And the girl?
*: 
	Er, y-yes. She was making a fuss too, see...
Soldier
	..................
	...Very well.
Soldier
	See that she's given medical treatment at once!
*: 
	S-sorry? ...Er, yes, sir. Right away!
Soldier
	And throw these two boys in jail!
*: 
	Yes, sir!
*: 
	Let's go!
Harry
	This is bad news. Still, I suppose it's better than getting a whipping! Ha ha ha!
Harry
	I suppose there's nothing much we can do. May as well just relax and enjoy the break, eh?
Harry
	Hm. I wonder how long they're
	planning on keeping us in here.
Harry
	Hey! It sounds like someone's coming!
Harry
	What do you suppose that was all about?
	Let's go and have a look!
Maria
	Thank you so much for coming to my rescue before.
Harry
	Oh, you'reⓚⓛ
Maria
	Come this way.
Soldier
	I can't thank you enough for helping my little sister, Maria. My name's Joshua.
Joshua
	I've thought this of you before, but you
	seem different from the other slaves. Your
	eyes are alive, somehow.
Joshua
	And that's why I've chosen you to ask this favour of. Will you hear me out?
Joshua
	You see, it's just a rumour but...
Joshua
	Well, there are whispers that all of the slaves will have to be killed when the temple is finished to keep what happened here a secret.
Joshua
	The thought of that happening to my beloved Maria!
Joshua
	So I'm begging you, please take her away from here!
Joshua
	When you were brought here all those
	years ago, your money and belongings
	were dumped in that barrel.
Joshua
	This place... This is where slaves are brought when they die. The barrels are used for floating their bodies away from here.
Joshua
	I know it must sound like a horrible idea, but if you float away in one of those barrels, you may just make it out alive.
Joshua
	But you have to hurry! Get inside the barrel quick before someone finds us here!
Joshua
	Well, I'm going to tell you anyway.
Maria
	.....................
~ Maria is hanging her head down in silence and won't reveal what she's thinking. ~
*: 
	Oi! Take me with ya, mate!
~ Joshua undoes the chain around the barrel and, closing his eyes in prayer that it makes it to safety, sets it free. ~
Harry
	What are you waiting for, %a000090? We can't pass up a chance like this!
Harry
	Come on! Let's get inside that barrel!
Harry
	What are you doing, %a000090!? Hurry up and get inside the barrel before someone comes along and finds us!
~ Something terrible's happening to a girl who looks a lot like Maria. It would be cruel to just abandon her! ~
Nun of the Above
	Ah! What a relief to see you awake at last!
	You must have been exhausted, child.
Nun of the Above
	You've been sound asleep for five days now. I was starting to worry that you'd never wake up.
Nun of the Above
	I still can't get over the shock of how you got here, in a barrel of all things!
Nun of the Above
	Your companion's been telling me all about it. You escaped from the most awful-sounding place, you poor child.
Nun of the Above
	This is Heaven's Above Abbey, and we sisters here are all nuns of the Order of the Above.
	Please rest here until you feel well again.
Nun of the Above
	Oh yes. We found those clothes in amongst your belongings.
Nun of the Above
	The things you had on were in such a state that we thought it would be best if you were spruced up a bit.
Harry
	%0%a000090! You're finally awake!
Harry
	And you've changed and everything! Oh yes, you did bring a few things with you.
Harry
	Look at me, though, still every bit the slave! I suppose it doesn't really matter.
Harry
	Much more important is that Maria's going to take part in some kind of baptism ceremony so that she can live here from now on!
Harry
	You're probably not really in the mood having just woken up, but we should go along and watch.
Nun of the Above
	We will now call upon the Goddess to bestow her blessing on our new friend, Maria.
Nun of the Above
	We thank the Goddess that you found your way here to us at Heaven's Above Abbey, dear friend Maria.
Nun of the Above
	And we call upon the Almighty One to grant you her blessing on this day.
~ Abbess Abovall pours ruby-coloured liquid slowly from the glass and hands it to Maria. ~
Nun of the Above
	With this symbolic drink, we pray that the protection of the Goddess now flows within and around you.
Nun of the Above
	Henceforth, you will dedicate yourself to your studies such that the beauty of your blessed soul may never be sullied.
Nun of the Above
	This concludes our ceremony. Now, let us all return to our duties.
Nun of the Above
	You're one of the fellows who was washed up here in that barrel with Maria, aren't you?
Nun of the Above
	The more I speak with that dear girl, the more I can't fail to be impressed by how sweet she is in her nature.
Nun of the Above
	It's almost as if she was born solely for the purpose of serving the Goddess.
Maria
	Oh! You're finally up and about again! It's such a relief to see you looking well.
Maria
	I haven't really thanked you properly for bringing me to safety like my brother asked.
Maria
	It's so awful to imagine him and all those other poor slaves still stuck there in that wretched place.
Maria
	I feel truly blessed to be here and to be free.
	The Goddess must have had a hand in my good fortune.
Maria
	Um, my brother gave me this and I want you to have it, %a000090.
~ %0%a000090 receives one thousand gold coins! ~
Maria
	I hope it'll come in useful. I have faith that the courage you and Harry have will be like a beacon to guide our troubled world into the light.
Maria
	I haven't really thanked you properly for bringing me to safety like my brother asked.
Maria
	It's so awful to imagine him and all those other poor slaves still stuck there in that wretched place.
Maria
	I hope it'll come in useful. I have faith that the courage you and Harry have will be like a beacon to guide our troubled world into the light.
*: 
	I wish I could go out and play!
*: 
	Hey! Did you know that there's a big town to the north of here? It's amazing. There's so much to do there.
Nun of the Above
	Oh yes. We found those clothes in amongst your belongings.
Nun of the Above
	The things you had on were in such a state that we thought it would be best if you were spruced up a bit.
Nun of the Above
	I'd like you to have this statue of the Goddess as a good luck charm for your safe onward journey.
~ %0%a000090 receives a crude image. ~
~ %0%a000180 acquires a crude image. ~
Nun of the Above
	That statue was carved with love and prayers by we nuns of Heaven's Above Abbey.
Nun of the Above
	It doesn't have any special powers or anything like that, but I hope it will at least make a nice keepsake of your time here.
Nun of the Above
	We make all of our own clothes and grow our own food here at the abbey, you see.
Nun of the Above
	So we're used to making things for ourselves.
*: 
	I'm here 'cos I ran away from my husband. He's a mean old ruffian, so he is.
*: 
	Eh? You run away from somewhere an' all, did you? It's a small world!
Nun of the Above
	I've heard all about what happened to you, you poor thing. A slave for ten years! But now you're free at last.
Nun of the Above
	I'm sure there will never again come a time when you are forced to submit to the will of another.
Nun of the Above
	Your father is an angel in heaven now.
Nun of the Above
	So it's for you and you alone to decide what the future holds, where you'll go and what you'll do.
Nun of the Above
	But don't let this overwhelm you. This freedom is the essence of life, and you must savour it.
Nun of the Above
	I heard talk of the Order of Zugzwang a little while ago when I was staying at a town on my travels.
Nun of the Above
	It seems they want to create some kind of utopia where everyone can live in happiness and peace.
Nun of the Above
	It would be wonderful if this ideal world was possible, but the happiness of one's family and friends has to be one's first priority.
Nun of the Above
	If people could just ensure that much, then everyone would end up happy that way too!
Nun of the Above
	This room is set aside for when we receive important lady guests.
Nun of the Above
	We had a young rich girl here until just the other day undergoing her domestic goddess training.
Nun of the Above
	She was such a beautiful and kind-hearted girl. I think we probably learnt more from her than she did from us!
Nun of the Above
	First we were blessed with her presence, and now we have your Maria. We're so lucky to have such delightful people around us.
Harry
	Sorry I came out without saying anything just then, %a000090.
Harry
	I knew Maria all that time when we were slaves, and yet I never noticed until today how beautiful she is.
Harry
	I wonder if she's planning on staying here forever. It's not as if we could even stay with her if we were inclined to.
Harry
	Oh well. I'm not sure what I'm going to do from here. Let me know when you're leaving, won't you?
Harry
	Are you ready to go now?
Harry
	It's about time you set off in search of your mother, I suppose.
Harry
	I don't really have anywhere special to go.
	Can I tag along with you?
Harry
	Brilliant! Now that's decided, let's get going!
Harry
	I'll go and tell everyone we're leaving.
	You wait here!
Harry
	Well, that's just charming!
Harry
	Anyway, if I remember rightly, you're supposed to be my lackey, aren't you?
Harry
	So you'd better start listening to your master, understood?
Harry
	Oh...
Harry
	Still, we were ever so lucky making it here alive, don't you think?
Harry
	I'd almost given up hope back there in the barrel.
	I was despairing, and then I heard a noise like a bell ringing.
Harry
	It relaxed me somehow, made me stop worrying. Now I come to think of it, it was probably the bell from this abbey.
~ The cat is walking happily through the grass. ~
Nun of the Above
	So you're leaving us. I hear you're embarking on a journey in search of your mother.
Nun of the Above
	Perhaps you might be able to find some clues at the large town to the north of here.
	Take care, my child.
Maria
	Thank you so much for everything.
Maria
	I'm going to pray here every day for all of those poor slaves still imprisoned at the temple.
Maria
	And I shall also be praying that you manage to find your mother, %a000090. Please take care on your travels. I'll never forget you.
Abbess Abovall
	You're a grown man now, %a000090.
Abbess Abovall
	It's up to you to find your own way through the journey of life.
Abbess Abovall
	But you must never feel alone. Remember that the Goddess is watching over you, always.
Abbess Abovall
	I'll be praying for Her to guide you on your journey.
Harry
	Time for the off!
~ Harry joins %a000090! ~
Abbess Abovall
	You're a grown man now, %a000090.
Abbess Abovall
	It's up to you to find your own way through the journey of life.
Abbess Abovall
	But you must never feel alone. Remember that the Goddess is watching over you, always.
Abbess Abovall
	I'll be praying for Her to guide you on your journey.
Maria
	Thank you so much for everything.
Maria
	I'm going to pray here every day for all of those poor slaves still imprisoned at the temple.
Maria
	And I shall also be praying that you manage to find your mother, %a000090. Please take care on your travels. I'll never forget you.
Nun of the Above
	If you travel north from here, you'll come to the large town of Fortuna.
Nun of the Above
	A lot of travellers pass through the place, so there's a good chance that you'll pick up some useful information there.
~ The cat is playing happily. ~

	You'll make someone a nice husband, my lovely!
Nun of the Above
	This is Heaven's Above Abbey. We have many lost and suffering sheep finding their way to our door.
Nun of the Above
	And you're among them. So young and yet you've seen so much suffering! Oh, dear Goddess, have mercy!
Nun of the Above
	This is Heaven's Above Abbey. We have many lost and suffering sheep finding their way to our door.
Nun of the Above
	I can see that even you, a monster, have some sadness in your heart. Be strong, my child.
*: 
	Maria is just so pretty!
*: 
	But all she ever does is pray, and she looks so sad and lonely sometimes.
Maria
	It was always just my brother and I, even when I was really small.
Maria
	Life was hard and we were living on the edge most of the time.
	㈡
	Then we found out about the Order of Zugzwang, and Joshua decided to become one of their soldiers.
Maria
	I was lucky enough to be able to study under Bishop Ladja, and we were so grateful for the opportunity to pull ourselves out of the mire.
Maria
	But I can never come to terms with the idea of sacrificing so many people just to build a grand temple.
Maria
	I'm so worried about what's become of Joshua. But there's nothing I can do apart from sit here and pray for him each day.
*: 
	Good heavens! You're fighting alongside %a000090, you say?
Maria
	What a noble cause for a monster! Make sure you do your best and give him all the help he needs!
Nun of the Above
	This is the visitors' lodgings. It's rather cramped, but would you like to rest for a while?
Nun of the Above
	Very well. I wish you pleasant dreams.
Nun of the Above
	Good morning! It's another beautiful day outside.

	We value every guest we have here at the abbey extremely highly. I do hope we'll make your acquaintance again.
Nun of the Above
	The more I speak with that dear girl, the more I can't fail to be impressed by how sweet she is in her nature.
Nun of the Above
	I know it's wrong to doubt people...
Nun of the Above
	But I find it hard to believe that any spiritual leader who'd turn that lovely soul into a slave could ever be good enough to save the world.
Nun of the Above
	This room is set aside for when we receive important lady guests.
Nun of the Above
	We had a young rich girl here until just the other day undergoing her domestic goddess training.
Nun of the Above
	She was such a beautiful and kind-hearted girl. I think we probably learnt more from her than she did from us!
Nun of the Above
	First we were blessed with her presence, and now we have your Maria. We're so lucky to have such delightful people around us.
Nun of the Above
	Good heavens! A monster in our peaceful sanctuary!
Nun of the Above
	Oh, I see. You're with %a000090, are you? Well, I'm glad to hear you're working for a worthy cause.
*: 
	Ah-phew... Daddy...
	Zzzz...
*: 
	The poor girl probably needs a father.
Nun of the Above
	Zzzz...
Nun of the Above
	Ah-phew, ah-phew...
~ The cat is sleeping peacefully. ~
Nun of the Above
	This is the visitors' lodgings. It's rather cramped, but would you like to rest for a while?
Nun of the Above
	Very well. I wish you pleasant dreams.
Nun of the Above
	Good morning! It's another beautiful day outside.
Nun of the Above
	We value every guest we have here at the abbey extremely highly. I do hope we'll make your acquaintance again.
Maria
	I really regret the involvement I had with the Order of Zugzwang.
Maria
	But the one good thing to come out of it was meeting you and Harry, %a000090. I wouldn't change that for the world.
Nun of the Above
	That's odd. Maria's gone all red. I wonder what's the matter.
*: 
	This here's the town of Fortuna, the land of hope and glory!
*: 
	Oh, man! I lost again. I guess there's just no such thing as a quick buck in this life.
*: 
	Why don't ya take a stroll outside town for a while? You'll soon pass the time till evenin'.
*: 
	I'm tellin' ya, the place sure looks different
	of a night.
*: 
	I came here because I'd always dreamt of becoming a dancer.
*: 
	I'm going to do it! I won't let anyone put me off.
	I'll be the smoothest swinger in town!
*: 
	Meooow...
*: 
	I came to Fortuna here because I heard of an amazing shop selling the most unusual items.
	But it's closed during the day, apparently.

	I'd love to head over there and buy one

*: 
	Welcome!
*: 
	Ya can read, right? Like the sign says, customers only through here.
*: 
	You want something, mister?
*: 
	I'm kinda busy right now.
	I'm playing hide-and-go-seek.
	We can talk later, okay?
*: 
	Hey, mister! Can't you go talk to someone else?
	He's gonna find me!
~ ⓗNo passage without purchase! ~
~ Store customers only, please!ⓘ ~

*: 
	Do you know about the Old Curiosity Shop?
*: 
	Even the shop curtain is a really rare item. It's a Fortuna slime curio!
*: 
	Apparently it's the only one of its kind, so the storekeeper won't consider selling it to you unless you're a very special customer.
*: 
	No? It's a real strange place, on the far west side of town.
*: 
	No way! You bought the slime curio?
*: 
	That's amazing! If I was you, I'd put it on display in a museum or something. I mean, it's like, ultra-rare!
*: 
	Hello. You look like %H0860%Xa fellow traveller%Yfellow travellers%Z.
	I'm a travelling salesman, you know.
*: 
	I came here from the north-west. Passed a dismal-looking town on the way. It looked really
	run-down.
*: 
	I couldn't believe people were actually living in a place like that.
*: 
	Well, hi there.
	Know what I just heard?
*: 
	Apparently there's a spell called Peep that tells ya all kinds of stuff about items and things.
*: 
	Hi there. Oh, you're one of my husband's pals?
	What do you make of it, then?
*: 
	He keeps talkin' about going to do business in this big castle town way up in the north-east.
*: 
	But I've heard some pretty scary things about that place. I don't know if it's such a great idea.
*: 
	Want somethin' to drink, my friend?
	What's that? Ya don't drink alcohol?
	Most people your age just love the stuff!
*: 
	I might be way off base here, but I'm guessin' ya come from a pretty down-and-out kinda background, huh? Am I right?
*: 
	I gotta get dinner on the table before my old man and son get home.
*: 
	You look like %H0860%Xa traveller%Ytravellers%Z to me.
	Don't you miss having a home to
	go back to in the evening?
*: 
	No, I guess you're too young to feel
	like that yet, huh?
*: 
	Yee-ha... Yee-phew...
	Yee-ha... Yee-phew...
*: 
	Time don't stop for no one, you know.
	It just keeps marchin' on.
*: 
	Fortuna was just a tiny little village when I was growin' up, but ever since they made that bridge to the north, folk have been flockin' in.
*: 
	Must be ten years now since it was made, I guess.

Mystic Mridula

*: 
	I'm Monty, the famous monster monitor. But I'm sure you've heard of me, haven't you?
Monty
	Hmm... There's a twinkle in your eye that I like, %A0120%Xmister%Z%B0120%Xlady%Z%C0120%X%Z! A kind twinkle, and a sharp one at that.
Monty
	I wouldn't mind betting you could tame monsters and get them to join your party, you know.
Monty
	What? How would you go about that?
	Ah-ha! Let me explain...
Monty
	First, you need to get hold of a wagon.
Monty
	Then you need to fight the monsters. But not
	with any malice in your heart. No, you need to
	feel the love!
Monty
	When the monsters feel your compassion, they'll ask if they can join your party.
Monty
	But they only respect adversaries who are
	stronger than them. Which means you need
	to defeat them first.
Monty
	Well? Did you follow all that?
Monty
	Good! I bet someone like you could befriend dozens of monsters!
Monty
	Of course, having a wagon will let you take a lot
	of monsters around with you, but even then, there are limits.
Monty
	And that's where I come in!
	I can look after your surplus, if you like.
Monty
	Then I'll explain it again...
Monty
	Huh? You haven't heard of me?
	Oh, well...
*: 
	Hi! I'm, like, Monty's assistant, Carla.
Carla
	Ya know, if you, like, wanna get monsters to do
	what you say, you've gotta wait until they're, like, way wise.
Carla
	If you can get their wisdom up to, like, twenty or more, they should pretty much do what you tell them.
Carla
	Guess you better, like, leave them in your wagon or something until they wise up.
*: 
	This is the town prison. If you wanna talk to the inmates, better do it through the bars.
*: 
	I still can't believe I got found out.
	I've been cheatin' in that casino for years.
*: 
	I guess I peaked too soon. Nothing's gonna beat the days when I used to kidnap people and sell them to the highest bidder!
*: 
	Hi there! Welcome to the casino. We've got all kinds of games in here, but everything works with tokens.
*: 
	You can buy tokens from the cashier over there.
*: 
	They never give you gold back, no matter how many tokens you win.
*: 
	The best way to enjoy the fun's to buy tokens with any leftover gold you have, but not to break the bank.
*: 
	Listen to this!
*: 
	See that monster? It's such a long shot, they're offering odds of twenty to one! Can you believe it!?
*: 
	Go on! That's the way!
*: 
	I just don't seem to be winning at all today...
*: 
	Oops! That's another day's wages down the drain. Oh, well!
*: 
	These performers aren't bad.
*: 
	That's weird. How come nothing's coming out, huh?
*: 
	How's it goin', pal?
	Are ya winnin'?
*: 
	Yeah? Go for it, then! You gotta go for it when you're on a winnin' streak!
*: 
	No? Don't worry, it'll come. Your luck's gotta change sometime, right?
*: 
	Folks are all talkin' about this darkness that's gonna destroy the world.
*: 
	But we've all gotta die sometime, right?
	Gotta enjoy life while you can, I say.
	Let the good times roll!
*: 
	There's people from all walks o' life in this here town. The good, the bad and the ugly.
*: 
	When ya get to my age, them's the kinda things that keep y'alive. Ha ha ha ha.
*: 
	Have ya heard about the legendary hero?
	Everyone's speculatin' about whether he's
	gonna show or not.
*: 
	I've got a thousand G down that says he does!
Tylbert
	Shall I compare thee to a winter's day?
	Thou art more cold and more harsh to me.
Tylbert
	Yet o, how I love thee!
	How I dote on thee, Rometta!
Tylbert
	Curse Julian! How bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes!
	Off with his head!
Rometta
	O Julian, Julian, wherefore art thou Julian?
	I do digest the poison of thy flesh.
Rometta
	Yet to bear a poison, I would temper it, for thou art lovely. More fairer than fair!
Julian
	O, woe is me! The miserable have no other medicine but only hope.
Julian
	Rometta! With joy Tylbert will embrace you,
	for he's honourable.
Julian
	Though love is blind, and lovers cannot see, I will wear my heart upon my sleeve for you to peck at, my love!
Julian
	Would then thou follow me? Or should I be like one lost in a thorny wood alone?

	According to what I've heard, there's a king somewhere who collects those mini medals that
	crop up all over the place.

	Apparently, he's so delighted if you take them to him, he gives you little prizes and things!
*: 
	And I've already got twenty of the little blighters myself! Who knows what I'll get? Ha ha ha ha!
*: 
	My wife's taking a bath at the moment. She deserves it after a hard day at work.
*: 
	Aaaah! You surprised me!
*: 
	You should be careful, sneaking up on people like that.
*: 
	But I've finished my bath already, and I'm dressed again now, so no harm done.
*: 
	My kids have started playin' outside of town just recently. It's kind of a worry.

	I wish the world was a more peaceful place,

	Ah-phew...
