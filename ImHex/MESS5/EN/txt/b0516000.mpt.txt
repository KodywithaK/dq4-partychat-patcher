Bianca
	This is another big old tower, eh? What's the plan, anyway? I'm not sure that climbin' it is the best idea at the moment.
Nera
	What are we doing here? Oh! So this is where
	the Zenith Dragon's powers were supposedly
	sealed away?
%0%a001240
	I knew about this island existing before, but I had no idea there was this tower here.
%0%a001250
	Oh! I hate heights!
Sancho
	J-Just l-l-looking at all those estairs...
	I no feel so good.
Tuppence
	Who'd have thought there'd be a tower hidden among all these big mountains? Seems a bit odd to me.
%0%a001240
	What a cool tower, having the entrance at the top!
%0%a001240
	Shame we have to go all the way down to the bottom to get out.
%0%a001250
	Um, are we still high up?
	Or is it safe to open my eyes now?
Sancho
	Thees p-p-place, ees estrange... Djou c-can
	f-f-feel the evil h-here as esoon as djou enter. 
Sancho
	My M-M-Majesty. We must br-brace ourselves
	f-for trouble.
Tuppence
	I s-say, %a000090! The monsters in this tower are rather f-formidable!
%0%a001240
	Did... Did that woman back there just die?
%0%a001240
	Wow... If only we'd got here a bit sooner.
%0%a001250
	What did she mean about the dragon's eyes? Why would anyone care so much about that?
%0%a001250
	Dad... Will you hold my hand?
Sancho
	No! The monsters, they cannot
	g-g-g-get away with this!
Sancho
	I n-never have the honour of kn-knowing djour name, señorita. But I pr-promise djou, we, we gⓚgonna avenge djour death!
Tuppence
	We can't run away just because she told us to.
Tuppence
	Goddess rest her soul, though, the poor woman.
%0%a001240
	Hey! What's that? Let's go and have a
	closer look, Dad.
Sancho
	Careful. Esomething just moved.
%0%a001240
	So we're at the bottom level. It's just how it looks from outside; bigger than all the other floors.
%0%a001250
	Is that...a dragon's neck? Is there more of it
	further down?
%0%a001240
	What's wrong, Dad? You look like
	you've seen a ghost.
%0%a001240
	Did you know that monster guy back there
	or something?
%0%a001250
	Um, Dad. That monster then...
%0%a001250
	Um... Never mind.
Sancho
	Come, we must carry on. We estill have many things to do here een this tower.
Tuppence
	That was a shock. That monster certainly put up quite a fight.
%0%a001240
	Turned Pankraz to ashes? So he's the one who killed grandpa? I'll never forgive him!
%0%a001250
	This is the first time I've ever felt pure hatred for a monster. I'll fight with all my might next time.
Sancho
	E-Eet was h-heem? He k-k-killed señor Pankraz?
	No! Th-The pain in my heart, ees t-t-too m-much!
Tuppence
	I thought we were for it more times than I can
	count. That was one battle that was a little too
	close for comfort.
%0%a001240
	It looks fairly straightforward from the outside, but this tower is as complicated as you like.
%0%a001240
	I don't think I've ever seen so many stairs!
	It's okay, though. I can handle it.
%0%a001240
	This must be the tower we heard about in Zenithia. The tower where the Zenith Dragon's powers were sealed away.
%0%a001250
	I don't like anywhere that I can
	see a long way down.
%0%a001250
	I know I have to just put up with situations like this if we're going to find Mum.
Sancho
	Ees my duty to protect djou weeth my life,
	My Majesty.
Sancho
	B-B-But this place, ees so d-dark. There ees n-no even one w-w-w-window.
Tuppence
	The monsters here are a bit too strong for my liking. Are you doing alright, %a000090?
Tuppence
	I'll watch your back, don't you worry.
	You just keep pushing on ahead!
%0%a001240
	It's a bit weird that it has a basement even though it's a tower.
%0%a001250
	It's dark, isn't it? ...I'm not scared, though.
	I've got my eyes closed, you see.
Sancho
	Esuddenly, the air, eet has changed. Ees n-no like before. We do not know what ees coming.
	We must b-be careful.
Tuppence
	Yikes! It's a poisonous swamp!
	Mind how you go, %a000090!
%0%a001240
	Brrr... Is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
%0%a001240
	This is quite big for an underground chamber.
	I wonder which way we need to go.
%0%a001250
	Um, don't go running off anywhere fast, will you? I've got my eyes closed, you see.
%0%a001250
	Brrr... I don't like the feel of this place.
Sancho
	These things, they are esent to try us by the Goddess. We must take care, and move eslowly.
Sancho
	Esince just now, I have the estrangest feeling.
Sancho
	As eef ees d-d-destiny that I have c-come here this day.
Tuppence
	It seems that the monsters are getting stronger the further down we go. Or is it just my imagination?
Tuppence
	I'll watch your back, don't you worry.
	You just keep pushing on ahead!
%0%a001240
	Why do you suppose those monsters were so interested in the dragon's eyes?
%0%a001240
	There seem to be a lot of mysteries about this tower.
%0%a001240
	Do you think we're getting any closer to finding Mum with all this travelling we're doing, Dad?
%0%a001240
	I wonder how the Zenith Dragon's powers were sealed away? Do you know, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Bad monsters are bad through and through, right? They never just turn good and start behaving themselves?
%0%a001250
	There's something bothering me about that dragon statue. There seemed to be something missing around its face.
Sancho
	I, I did not expect this... I n-never imagined I would f-find señor Pankraz's k-k-k-keeller here. I, I am overcome by my f-f-f-feelings...
Sancho
	But now h-he has escaped, we must f-finish what we came here to do.
Tuppence
	Erm, so what do we do now again?
%0%a001240
	I didn't expect the dragon's face to have a device like that hidden in it!
%0%a001240
	Whoever came up with the idea of going along on its tongue must have been an eccentric one. Just like Dr. Agon, in fact!
%0%a001250
	It's fun walking along a dragon's tongue. And it's not even scary, even if it is high up.
Sancho
	This contraption, it ees loco, no!?
Sancho
	I have forgotten the estress of the battle we just fought already.
Tuppence
	What do you suppose is waiting for us in
	here? There seem to be ferocious monsters
	all over the place.
%0%a001240
	Looking through that hole is really scary! I bet %a001250 would cry if she had a look!
%0%a001250
	Aren't we done here yet? Ohhh!
Sancho
	The l-ladders and the ropes, they are dangerous, amigo. If djour mind wanders and djou are thinking about paella, djou will fall!
%0%a001240
	So this is a dragon orb.
%0%a001240
	I bet the monsters we saw before would love to get their claws on it.
%0%a001240
	I wonder if the powers of the Zenith Dragon really are inside this orb. It's all a bit weird, really.
%0%a001250
	What a pretty orb. It's glowing even more brightly than the gold orb.
Sancho
	At last, we have completed this task.
	It was no cinch, no?
Tuppence
	Um, don't have me carry anything too important,
	will you? I'd never forgive myself if I dropped it and it broke!
%0%a001240
	I would never have believed there was such a big room inside a statue like this!
%0%a001250
	This dragon is so big and majestic.
%0%a001240
	Wow! What an amazing-looking staff!
Sancho
	This staff, ees p-p-perfect for djou, My Majesty. It esuits djou so well.
%0%a001240
	Look how high up the ceiling is! We did well climbing all the way down here!
%0%a001250
	This tower is just full of stairs and ladders and ropes. It's totally exhausting!
Sancho
	I, I cannot estop th-th-thinking about the monster...
	Its face ees g-gonna h-haunt me forever.
Tuppence
	Brrr... Here's hoping we won't be running into any more monsters that strong.
Bianca
	Okay, I get it. You all explored this place. Very nice. Now can we move on?
Nera
	We don't have much time. Maybe you could show me around this place when everything's calmed down and got back to normal?
%0%a001240
	We don't need to do anything here any more, right, Dad? Let's go!
%0%a001250
	I've had enough, Dad. When we've finished what we're doing, I want to go straight home. I'm not very good with towers.
Sancho
	We have no more to do een this tower.
	We must move on.
%0%a001240
	I wonder what we're supposed to do with this orb. We've brought it here to Zenithia, but now what?
%0%a001250
	It's a relief to have made it here to Zenithia.
Sancho
	Djou no w-wonder where ees señor Agon?
%0%a001240
	It's a bit nerve-racking moving the castle about
	the place. We'd never be able to afford to pay
	for any damage.
%0%a001250
	I can't help feeling a bit bad about landing the castle on the ground. I mean, Zenithia's supposed to float up above the clouds, after all.
%0%a001240
	This is from the Yggdrasil tree?
	A tiny little sapling like this?
%0%a001250
	It's so tiny and delicate!
	Can I give it some water, Dad?
%0%a001250
	This tiny sapling's done so well in all that water.
	It's a determined little thing.
Sancho
	They esay djou can br-bring esomeone who has passed away b-b-back from the dead weeth the leaf of Yggdrasil.
Sancho
	But thees ees j-just a sapling. Eet n-no has esuch estrong power djet, I believe.
Tuppence
	If we can keep this sapling going, we'll have all the Yggdrasil leaves we could possibly need! Now we can fight to the death without having to worry!
%0%a001240
	ⓗThe darkness spreadethⓘ... I think that means
	we'd better hurry, Dad.
%0%a001250
	That poor sapling, confined to such a tiny pot!
%0%a001250
	Once we've defeated Nimzo, we'll have to make
	sure it's moved to a nice big place with lots and
	lots of sunshine!
Sancho
	Si, ees j-just the esapling, but ees fr-fr-from the Great W-World Tree. Eef djou n-no look after eet well, the Goddess, she gonna m-make djou pay!
%0%a001240
	A present? We're not supposed to take presents from strangers. But I suppose it's okay if you're here, Dad.
%0%a001240
	I didn't know there were faeries here, too. Do you think Zenithians and faeries are all good friends?
%0%a001250
	Is that grass Yggdrasil? Ooh...
Sancho
	Uf! The dew of Yggdrasil, ees a v-very
	v-v-valuable thing.
%0%a001240
	That's not fair! Why can we only have one lot at
	a time? It'd be much better if we could takes loads of it!
%0%a001250
	We'll have to make sure we use the bit of Yggdrasil dew we have carefully then, Dad.
Sancho
	Si. Ees true. Eef djou h-have too much of esomething like thees, djou f-forget the true v-value of life.
Tuppence
	You'd think she could just slip us a few extra lots out of goodwill, wouldn't you? We are fighting for world peace, after all.
%0%a001240
	We would never have made it inside the tower without that grappling hook.
%0%a001240
	It's a good job we found that in his cupboard, rather than just a load of old man's pants!
%0%a001250
	I wonder why the old man had that grappling hook in the first place.
%0%a001250
	You don't think he used to be a burglar, do you?
%0%a001240
	Centuries? Wow! I didn't realise this place
	was so old.
%0%a001250
	Have you ever met the Zenith Dragon, Dad?
	I've only ever seen pictures of him in books.
Sancho
	Then we m-must find thees Zenith Dragon, si?
Tuppence
	Are humans really all that noble? I'd say gods have the edge there, myself.
%0%a001240
	Zenithia is certainly a fairly tricky place to find your way around!
%0%a001240
	Can the castle still only fly low to the ground?
	I want to see it float right up to the heavens!
%0%a001250
	It looks like things have dried out nicely. The castle has a much happier feel to it now.
%0%a001250
	Zenithia used to be much, much higher all those
	years ago, didn't it? We're lucky we didn't have to climb so high.
Sancho
	Eso, thees ees h-how the eenside of Zenithia looks?
	Ees v-very interesting, no? Eef we h-had more time, I l-like to look around...
Tuppence
	I'll be able to hold my head up high when we get back to Gotha, so I will! There's not many folk who can say they've been to Zenithia.
%0%a001240
	What a long ladder!
	And it's really dark, too...
%0%a001250
	I'm okay. As long as I don't look down, I'm okay.
%0%a001240
	That all  sounds a bit odd.
	What do you suppose has been going on?
Sancho
	Ees v-very estrange, si?
%0%a001240
	But Dad! Dr. Agon's not evil!
	We have to do something to help him.
Sancho
	We can n-no just ignore thees, eh?
	Djou must d-d-do esomething, My Majesty.
%0%a001250
	Yikes. It's scary seeing a Zenithian get angry
	like that!
Tuppence
	Hmph! Well, well, well...
	What a turn up for the books!
Tuppence
	Well, %a000090, you know you can count on me to help you put this Dr. Agon in his place if he isn't what he seems.
%0%a001240
	Dr. Agon isn't a bad man, Dad!
	I just know he isn't.
%0%a001250
	I feel so nervous! I wonder what would happen if we gave him the orb.
Sancho
	Djou n-never know wh-what ees gonna happen, eh?
	I n-no like thees...
%0%a001240
	Wow!
%0%a001240
	Th-That was a surprise!
	I didn't see that coming, did you, Dad?
%0%a001250
	The Zenith Dragon... So Dr. Agon was the
	Zenith Dragon all along!
Sancho
	When djou travel, m-many, many things, they surprise djou. B-But thees...?
	No, I n-no believe thees.
Sancho
	Ees, ees... Eet h-hits djou like the armada!
Tuppence
	To think that Dr. Agon was actually the
	Zenith Dragon...
Tuppence
	Forgive me, o Great One, for my ignorance!
%0%a001240
	I quite liked his human form, actually.
%0%a001240
	But it is good to see him back to his true self.
	I mean, he's pretty cool!
%0%a001250
	Is that really the Zenith Dragon in the flesh?
	This is like living a dream.
Sancho
	T-To have the Z-Zenith Dragon esay gracias to djou, ees, ees...
Tuppence
	Yes, well. He was rather powerless.
Tuppence
	Oops! Not that I mean any offence, of course!
Bianca
	So the Zenith Dragon was masqueradin' as a bumblin' middle-aged man?
Bianca
	What I'd give to have bin able to see that!
Nera
	The great Zenith Dragon...
	I'm quite overwhelmed.
%0%a001240
	Well, it can't be helped. There's no way any of us could've known his true identity.
Sancho
	But ees because he was tr-trying to protect Zenithia, si? Thees ees why he d-doubted señor Agon. Ees n-nothing to be ashamed.
Tuppence
	I also feel great shame for my faithlessness.
%0%a001240
	It's a relief to know that the Zenith Dragon is back on form again. I feel much more confident about everything now.
Sancho
	We n-no need to worry about Zenithia no more, eh?
%0%a001240
	I suppose he's right. We still have a battle to win. We'd better get to it, then!
%0%a001250
	That old man can't know much about what's going on in the outside world, being holed up here all the time.
%0%a001250
	It's good that we passed on the news about the Zenith Dragon.
%0%a001240
	Dr. Agon didn't exactly have to do all that much, though, did he?
%0%a001240
	Oh well. It's hardly worth going into that now.
%0%a001240
	The Zenith Dragon's really amazing. Do you think he can fly even higher than the castle?
Bianca
	I never imagined for one minute that I'd ever have the chance to visit Zenithia.
Bianca
	I can't help feelin' a bit out of sorts. Maybe it's my Zenithian blood at work.
Nera
	So this is the home of my ancestors...
	But I belong with you now, in Gotha.
Nera
	Being here makes me feel relaxed and on edge all at the same time!
Nera
	I can't really explain it, but something in my heart just won't settle.
%0%a001240
	Zenithia is certainly a fairly tricky place to find your way around!
%0%a001240
	Can the castle still only fly low to the ground?
	I want to see it float right up to the heavens!
%0%a001250
	It looks like things have dried out nicely. The castle has a much happier feel to it now.
%0%a001250
	Zenithia used to be much, much higher all those
	years ago, didn't it? We're lucky we didn't have to climb so high.
Sancho
	Djou know, when djou l-look again, ees a
	v-very b-b-beautiful castle, si? Djou f-feel eso much h-history.
Tuppence
	I'll certainly have a story to tell back in Gotha! Imagine people's reactions when they hear I was responsible for the Zenith Dragon's resurrection!
%0%a001240
	Did you see that little room by the entrance, Dad? What do you think it's for?
%0%a001240
	This building's incredible. I can't imagine how
	they managed to build something so huge on
	top of a mountain!
%0%a001240
	Brrr. It's a bit c-c-cold here, isn't it, D-D-Dad?
%0%a001240
	I s-s-suppose it's because we're high up.
	We're even above the c-c-clouds. Brrr.
%0%a001250
	Hahh, hahh, hahh... It's weird. Why am I so out of breath even though I'm not...hahh...doing anything?
%0%a001250
	Hahh, hahh, hahh...
%0%a001250
	Look, Dad! There's a cloud underneath us!
	I've never been this high up before.
Sancho
	A g-g-giant temple on the t-top of Mt. Azimuth?
	Ees, ees amazing!
Sancho
	Djou esee? I am estill j-just a djoung man.
	There ees eso much I n-no know about the world!
Tuppence
	That Zenith Dragon is rather spectacular, being able to fly up above the clouds like this.
Tuppence
	It's hard to believe He's the same creature as that funny Dr. Agon we were spending our time with not so long ago.
%0%a001240
	Is that... Is that armour mine?
%0%a001240
	Dad! What are you doing? If that's the Zenithian Armour, then we have to have it!
%0%a001240
	...Oh, I get it. You're planning on going away to get ready first so that we definitely win, right?
	That's really clever.
%0%a001250
	Phew. Looks like we managed to avoid a bit of a
	fight there.
Sancho
	Thees señor, he n-no realise we are n-no from thees place like heem, eh?
Sancho
	Djou have become v-very clever like thees, chico.
	Si, djou are a m-master of the tactics now.
%0%a001240
	Why should we be soulless?
	That's a bit of a weird thing to say.
%0%a001250
	Was that soldier a monster?
	Then that means this temple is... Hmm.
Tuppence
	Dear me. He was rather alarming, wasn't he?
%0%a001240
	So this is the armour the legendary hero wore!
	Wow! It's so cool!
%0%a001250
	Does this armour belong to %a001240 now, too? That's so unfair! ...Um, I mean, how lovely!
Sancho
	I n-no expect to find the legendary armour een a
	p-p-place like thees.
Tuppence
	Oof! It's rather heavy, isn't it? I suppose that just means I'm not cut out for this kind of armour.
%0%a001240
	Looks like he thinks we're part of the following.
%0%a001250
	What is this place? It's full of lots of really
	strange-looking people.
Sancho
	He can n-no imagine any other p-p-people, they gonna c-come eenside, eh?
Sancho
	We must pretend we are w-w-worshipers eso he no th-think we are esuspicious.
Tuppence
	Tsk tsk! What a useless guard he is, actually encouraging us intruders inside like that!
%0%a001240
	The people in here don't seem to notice us at all.
%0%a001240
	It's like they're all totally mesmerised by something.
%0%a001250
	That person just said something about Mada.
	Isn't Mada Grandma's name, too?
Sancho
	Hmm... Si, djour Uncle S-Sancho, he knows wh-what ees happening here now.
Sancho
	Djou listen to me, chico. Whatever djou esee here, djou must n-n-no believe eet, okay?
Tuppence
	M-Mada? Surely it couldn't be...?
%0%a001240
	Why should we be soulless?
	That's a bit of a weird thing to say.
%0%a001250
	Was that soldier a monster?
	Then that means this temple is... Hmm.
Sancho
	Si! Ees tr-true! Ees the monsters! They are een
	c-control of thees Order of Zugzwang!
Tuppence
	Dear me. He was rather alarming, wasn't he?
%0%a001240
	That kid's eyes looked really empty. It's like he couldn't see properly or something.
Sancho
	Ees no r-r-right. He can n-no esee us, even when we espeak to heem.
%0%a001250
	Do you think that person's okay, Dad?
	The people here are making me nervous.
Tuppence
	It's rather tricky to fathom whether the people here are alive or dead sometimes.
%0%a001240
	That statue almost looks like it's alive.
	...Hang on! I've seen a statue like this before...
%0%a001240
	I know! It looks just like you did when you were a statue! Does that mean...?
%0%a001250
	That lady looks so kind. I feel like I want to hug her for some reason.
Sancho
	Ch-Chico!
	Ees, ees djour w-w-wife!
	Ees %a001230!
Tuppence
	Hmm... What an exquisite-looking lady.
Tuppence
	It's rather odd, though. I can't help feeling like I've seen the same image somewhere before.
%0%a001240
	Can you believe he had the cheek to pretend to
	be Grandma?
%0%a001240
	Huh! Now I'm even more determined than ever.
	I won't rest until the world's at peace again.
%0%a001240
	Everyone seems to have livened up all of a sudden. Do you think that means they're back to normal again?
%0%a001250
	I knew deep down that wasn't really Grandma, but I was a little bit worried that it might be.
%0%a001250
	It's a relief that it wasn't her, but what do you think that nasty monster meant when he said she's not part of this world any more?
%0%a001250
	Maybe we should try having a word with everyone here, Dad. We might be able to find out something useful.
Sancho
	Djou no have t-t-time to feel the blues, chico.
Sancho
	Djou must c-c-concentrate and think of a way to esave %a001230.
Sancho
	Si, thees señora Mada, she was j-just a monster. But estill... N-Now djou can be esure djour madre, she ees een the underworld.
Tuppence
	The God-King, Korol... No doubt the time will come when we have to pit our strength against him.
%0%a001240
	No way! So this Korol character placed a curse on Mum as well as turning her into a statue?
%0%a001240
	Do you think the curse will be lifted if we manage to defeat him?
%0%a001250
	So...that really is Mum, then?
Tuppence
	Fancy not even realising that the legendary hero was born years ago. These monster types are terribly ignorant.
%0%a001250
	Isn't that boy the one from the house where you stayed when you were a statue, Dad? It's great that we were able to rescue him.
Sancho
	Ees, ees eso w-w-wonderful news! Thees muchacho's p-papá, he ees g-gonna be eso,
	eso h-h-h-happy! (sniff)
Tuppence
	It could be quite tricky for him to get home from here, though, couldn't it? I wonder how he'll manage.
%0%a001240
	A hidden staircase? We should go and find it
	right away!
%0%a001250
	Have you been to this place before, Dad?
	Hmm, I had a feeling you had.
Sancho
	The estage?
	He means the p-place where ees the estatue of señora %a001230, no?
%0%a001250
	You have to accept people's thanks gracefully and tell them it was no trouble. That's manners.
Sancho
	Esacrificed? Si, when the t-temple ees c-completed, all the eslaves, they g-gonna be keelled.
Tuppence
	I'd wager that she's rather a lovely specimen when she's smartened up a bit. It's all in the cheek bones, you know.
%0%a001240
	Quite a few people seem to be a bit dazed.
	I hope they'll be alright.
Sancho
	Ees, ees eso s-sad... Thees señors and señoras, they have been l-l-lied to for eso long.
%0%a001250
	The people up here must've been the important
	ones, then.
Tuppence
	If Korol took a liking to him, that probably means he did lots of evil things here.
%0%a001240
	So the stairs were right in the middle of the stage. That's a bit easy to find, considering it was supposed to be a hidden staircase!
%0%a001250
	We have to hurry up and help Mum.
	I'm going to try really hard to do my bit.
Sancho
	Djou m-must be careful, chico. Djour Uncle SⓚSancho, he has a b-b-bad feeling, djou know.
%0%a001240
	He must be a right coward to have built a secret staircase and hidden himself down here!
%0%a001250
	What's wrong, Dad? You look a bit troubled.
%0%a001250
	Of course... This is the place where you were made to work as a slave all those years ago.
Sancho
	Anda! Ees thees p-place djou were...
Sancho
	Si, but n-now djou are back again.
	Ees esome kind of d-destiny, no?
Tuppence
	Don't worry about me. I'm happy to follow you wherever you go, %a000090!
%0%a001240
	This place is pretty huge. And the monsters here are more than a bit scary, too.
%0%a001240
	Oh! I'm totally lost now. You'll have to figure out which way we need to go, Dad.
%0%a001250
	This place is like a labyrinth. You have to plan your next move really carefully otherwise you get lost.
%0%a001250
	This place is really hard to get around. I wonder why they made it this way. Don't the monsters
	get lost?
Sancho
	Ees eso much work to b-b-build a place eso beeg under the ground like thees, eh?
Sancho
	Anda! Djou n-no feel dizzy when djou w-w-walk around een the circles like thees?
Tuppence
	Hmph. These complicated paths are becoming really rather irritating.
Tuppence
	I'll just follow your lead, %a000090. I'm sure you'll be able to guide us through this place.
%0%a001240
	Looks like all the soldiers in this place are monsters. We'd better be careful, Dad.
%0%a001250
	Yikes! That's scary! It sounds like the monsters here have been feasting on the slaves.
Sancho
	The b-best thing, ees n-no to be found by
	the guards, si? Djou must take m-muchos
	care for thees.
%0%a001240
	We're almost there.
	Korol can't be far away now.
%0%a001250
	We must be careful, Dad. I'm sensing something evil down below.
Sancho
	Thees m-monster, he n-no realise he t-t-told us that thees Korol, he ees near here.
Sancho
	Chico! Ees t-time to regain djour estrength, no?
	Then we g-g-go eento battle! Olé!
%0%a001240
	That poor man! He must've been desperate,
	writing something like that in the hope that she'd
	read it one day.
%0%a001250
	Dear Goddess,
	Please grant this tormented soul peace within your safe haven. Amen.
Sancho
	Come, chico. We pr-pray, okay?
Tuppence
	I don't have any brothers or sisters, but I can still feel this poor chap's pain. What a way to go.
%0%a001240
	We are going the right way, aren't we?
	I'm not too sure...
%0%a001250
	I feel like we keep going round and round in circles. Everywhere seems to look the same.
Sancho
	Djou are l-lost, si, chico?
Tuppence
	How to find our way around this place is a complete mystery. I've never seen anywhere so complicated.
%0%a001240
	Up and down, big spaces and tiny spaces...
	This place is such a mishmash!
%0%a001250
	Um, do you think I've got a bit stronger, Dad?
	Am I being of any use to you?
Sancho
	Djou know, chico, esince we f-find thees estatue of señora %a001230, djou n-no look the esame.
Sancho
	Djou n-no geeve up now! Ees t-time to fight!
	Eef djou n-no fight now, when do djou fight, eh?
Tuppence
	Where is this confounded Korol fellow anyway?
	I hope he doesn't just pop out and catch us unawares.
%0%a001240
	I can sense a really strange aura. Wow! It's the strongest one I've felt yet, that's for sure.
%0%a001250
	Um... Is it okay if I hold your hand, Dad?
	I'm a little bit scared.
Sancho
	Are djou r-r-ready, chico?
Tuppence
	We won't let anyone get the better of us. No one can! I hope...
%0%a001240
	Hahh...Hahh... That Korol guy was really strong.
%0%a001240
	And then that Ladja character appeared.
	I can hardly get my head around it all.
%0%a001240
	You did pick up that ring, didn't you, Dad?
	I wonder where it came from. It's so shiny.
%0%a001250
	I hate Ladja! We'll have to make sure we give him a good hiding next time!
%0%a001250
	Is it okay if I have a bit of a look at that ring?
%0%a001250
	It's strange, but just holding it makes me feel all warm inside.
%0%a001250
	Sorry. I shouldn't have asked.
Sancho
	Aargh! Thees Ladja, he must p-p-p-pay for señor P-P-Pankraz! Next time, we n-no gonna let heem
	get away.
Sancho
	Ees estrange. When I l-look at thees ring, I can n-no help think of señora Mada.
Sancho
	Maybe ees j-just because we esee thees f-fake señora Mada before.
Tuppence
	Thank the Goddess I'm still alive! Even in the face
	of such a trying battle, Tuppence survives to fight another day!
Tuppence
	Well, we should be heading back to that big room so we can try to figure out how to bring %a001230 back to life.
%0%a001240
	I don't sense any monsters about.
	Maybe Korol was in charge of them all.
%0%a001250
	It's so much easier to walk about with no monsters coming and getting in our way. If only it could always be like this.
Sancho
	We were t-told señora Mada, she ees een the underworld, no?
Sancho
	Uf! Our quest, how long ees g-g-gonna last?
Tuppence
	What a gift it is that there are no monsters around. We should make the most of it and check there aren't any treasure chests we've missed.
%0%a001240
	D-Do you think that was really Grandma's voice we could hear?
%0%a001240
	She said even the legendary hero can't take on Grandmaster Nimzo, but surely that can't be right?
%0%a001250
	Grandma sounded so kind and gentle...
%0%a001250
	Oh! I wish I could speak to her more. There's so much I want to talk to her about.
Sancho
	I...!
	Ees...!
	Señora Madaaa!
Sancho
	Her words, eso f-full of l-l-love...
	Djou n-no forget thees words, chico. Never!
Tuppence
	Ah yes. A mother always puts the safety and needs of her children first.
Tuppence
	My mother's just the same.
%0%a001240
	Now I'm totally confused about what we should do.
%0%a001240
	I mean, I can understand how you feel, Dad.
	But I can see where Grandma's coming from, too.
%0%a001250
	Oh! I really wish I could get to meet Grandma.
Sancho
	Thees time I n-n-no gonna esay anything.
	Djou th-think for djourself what djou gonna do.
Sancho
	But djou n-no think I am c-c-cold, okay?
	Djou are the K-King of Gotha, My Majesty.
	Djou can n-no rely on djour Uncle Sancho forever.
Tuppence
	I'll have to give my old mum a nice shoulder rub when I go home to Gotha.
Tuppence
	I'm probably causing her no end of worry and stress at the moment, so it's the least I can do.
Bianca
	Aah... This is the temple I spent all them years in, stood stock-still as a statue.
Bianca
	Ha ha! This'll probably sound quite daft, but I almost feel a bit sentimental about the place.
Nera
	I hardly remember anything at all about those years I spent here as a statue.
Nera
	Maybe I was asleep most of the time.
%0%a001240
	What's up, Dad? What are we doing here?
%0%a001240
	We've rescued Mum now, so we don't have anything left to do here, right?
%0%a001250
	This is the place we had our reunion with Mum.
	But I'd still rather not come here.
%0%a001250
	Now she's with us again, I don't see the point in being reminded of those sad times without her.
Sancho
	We no have time to w-walk like a dog, chico.
	When djou are tr-travelling, djou must always
	know where djou are going and g-go there.
Tuppence
	I'd heard rumours about the Order of Zugzwang, of course. I always had a feeling there was something suspicious about them.
