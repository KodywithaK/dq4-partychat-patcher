	All living creatures are children of the Goddess. What brings you to our church, child?
*: 
	What brings you to our church in the dead of night, child?
*: 
	Confess all that you have done before the almighty Goddess, child. 
*: 
	And would you permit me to record your works in an adventure log?
*: 
	Into which adventure log do you wish me to record this?
*: 
	In that case, I must overwrite
	ⓗ%a000660: %0%a000090 %a000240ⓘ.
	Do you wish me to proceed, my child?
~ Saving adventure log. ~
~ Do not turn the power OFF ~
~ or remove the DS Game Card! ~
*: 
	By the Goddess, whatever could have happened? It appears that my attempt to record the adventure log has failed!
*: 
	I have successfully recorded your adventure log. Do you intend to continue on your adventure at this point, my child?
*: 
	You would prefer not to record your adventure? Well, that is your decision.
*: 
	Do you intend to continue on your adventure at this point, my child?
*: 
	By the Goddess! You intend to rest from your adventures without recording what you have done in an adventure log?
*: 
	You would have to restart your adventure from the time of your last confession. Are you sure this is what you want?
*: 
	O great and compassionate Goddess, please grant this child a peaceful respite!
~                   Bless you, my child. ~

*: 
	Faithful servant, %a000060!
	You appear to be strong enough as you are!
*: 
	%0%a000060, my child!
	You require %a000080 experience point%H0080%X%Ys%Z to reach the next level.
*: 
	Whom do you wish brought back to the world of the living?
*: 
	Surely you jest?
	%0%a000180 looks very much alive to me!
*: 
	In order to carry out this task, I shall require a small contribution of %a000650 gold coins. Will you oblige, my child?

	O great and benevolent Goddess!
*: 
	I beseech you to breathe life once more into your faithful servant, %a000180!
~ %0%a000180 is resurrected! ~

*: 
	From whom do you wish to lift a curse?
*: 
	Pardon me, but %a000180 does not seem to be cursed, child.
*: 
	Ah, it seems that the problem lies not with %a000180, but with %M0070%Xthose equipped items%Ythat equipped item%Z.
*: 
	I trust you will be able to remove the %M0070%Xcursed items%Ycursed item%Z without my assistance, child.
*: 
	In order to carry out this task, I shall require a small contribution of %a000400 gold coins. Will you oblige, my child?

*: 
	Donations to the church are an expression of gratitude to the great and benevolent Goddess!
	㈡
	*: But one must not request from people something that is beyond their means. Forgive me.
*: 
	It seems that you cannot afford to make this humble donation.
*: 
	Indeed?
	Very well. The choice is yours.
	May the Goddess smile upon thee.
*: 
	Is there any other way we can be of assistance?
*: 
	Great Goddess, may you watch over and protect this poor child!
