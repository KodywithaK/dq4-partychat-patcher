Crispin
	You'll see. Soon I'll be the knight in shining armour that Nera deserves.
Crispin
	I'll transform myself into a superman!
	One, two! One, two!
*: 
	Zzz... Zzz...
*: 
	If you don't rub a bit harder, it won't help one little bit, you old waster!
*: 
	Oh! You're not my husband!
	I, I do apologise.
*: 
	Everyone's gone to bed already, I'm afraid.
	Could you come back in the morning, please?
*: 
	Zzz... Zzz...
Debora
	What do you want? Sorry to break it to you, but I'm not interested in other women's husbands.
Debora
	So do me a favour and leave me alone, alright?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	At last! There you are, %a000090. Stopped off somewhere along the way to enjoy a bit of the dolce vita, did you?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I've decided the wedding will take place on my casino ship, the Ventuno. It's far, farfalle away in the north-east, but it'll be well worth the trip.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I was hoping to sail there, but the seas are dangerous these days.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	However, Prince Harry here has just informed me of another way we could get there.
Harry
	Hello, %a000090! You look well.
	I haven't seen you in ages.
Harry
	We rushed over here as soon as we received the invitation from Mr Briscoletti here.
Harry
	I hope you don't mind that I let on about your magic abilities. We were talking, and it just slipped out that you know how to cast Zoom.
Maria
	Congratulations, %a000090!
	It's wonderful news!
Maria
	And what a generous father-in-law. The wedding will be absolutely amazing by the sound of it.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ha ha hah! That's right! No expense spared!
	So, %a000090, will you do the honours?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Once you get us in the air with your magical extravaganza, I'll be able to direct you.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Are you all set?
~ %0%a000090 casts Zoom. ~
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Love of linguine!
	Now this is alfresco!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	What's the problem, %a000090?
	Is my daughter to marry a scaramouch!?
	Cast the spell!
*: 
	%0%a000090...
	Can you hear me, %a000090?
Nera
	Thank goodness!
	You've finally come round.
Nera
	You must have exhausted yourself bringing us all here with that spell.
Nera
	I don't suppose you remember, do you? You collapsed the moment we touched down here
	on the Ventuno.
Nera
	I'm sorry Papa asked you to overexert yourself like that. If anything were to happen to you, I, I...
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ah, back with us at last, are you?
	Hmph. Well, scusi me for tiring you out, %a000090.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I don't like to disturb your little siesta like this, but the wedding ceremony is about to start, and the groom is required!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	This good man will explain the plan of action to you.

Priest
	We are gathered here in the presence of the Goddess, to witness the blessed union of %a000090 and Nera.
Priest
	All turn to face the rear of the deck for the entrance of the bride, please!
Priest
	Dear Goddess. Thank you for guiding these two souls to meet here, on this most joyous of days.
Priest
	May you bless them with your eternal
	love and happiness.
Priest
	Now we will move on to your vows.
Priest
	Do you, %a000090, take Nera to be your wife?
Priest
	To love and to cherish, in sickness and in health, for as long as you both shall be resurrected from death in the church?
Priest
	And do you, Nera, take %a000090 to be
	your husband?
Priest
	To love and to cherish, in sickness and in health, for as long as you both shall be resurrected from death in the church?
Nera
	I do.
Priest
	Then we shall now move on to the exchange of the wedding rings...
~ %0%a000090 and Nera place their wedding rings on each other's fingers. ~
Priest
	So, in the presence of the Goddess, you will
	now demonstrate to everyone here that your
	union is complete.
Priest
	You may kiss the bride!
Harry
	Come along, %a000090! Don't be shy!
	Give her a sloppy one!
Nera
	Oh, %a000090...
~ %0%a000090 kisses Nera! ~
Priest
	Dear Goddess, behold this new union of two of your devoted flock!
Priest
	Bless them with your everlasting love and watch over them with your eternal compassion.
Harry
	Congrats, %a000090!
	You two make a great couple.
Bianca
	Congratulations, %a000090!
	You too, Nera. I hope you'll be really happy together.

	That's one hot bride you've got there, %a000090! You treat her right!

Nera
	Good morning, %a000090ⓚⓛ
	I mean, darling!
Nera
	You must have been absolutely exhausted.
	It's evening already, you know.
Nera
	Mind you, you did bring us all back here straight after the ceremony. Casting Zoom for so many
	people must be a terrible strain.
Nera
	I can't apologise enough for Papa.
	He really shouldn't have pushed you so hard.
Nera
	But I'm so happy! Being together like this, just the two of us, is like a dream come true!
Nera
	And from now on, we'll always be together,
	won't we?
Nera
	Listen, darling. I've been thinking...
Nera
	I want to come with you and help you on your quest.
Nera
	I mean, you're still going to carry on looking for your mother, aren't you?
Nera
	I couldn't bear just waiting around at home for you to come back.
Nera
	Please. Say you'll let me come with you.
Nera
	Oh, thank you, darling!
	Thank you!
~ Nera joins %a000090! ~
Nera
	We'll have to talk to Papa too, of course.
Nera
	Come along, darling. Let's go and ask him right now.
Nera
	I know I'm asking a lot. I know it's not fair of me.
	But please...
~ The bag feels unusually heavy. ~
~ %0%a000090 has a look inside... ~
~ Wow! There's a pair of sticky honey buns in there. ~
~ Mr Briscoletti gave them out to everyone in Mostroferrato to mark the special occasion. ~
Nera
	Wait, %a000090.
Nera
	We can't just leave without telling Papa.
Nera
	Are you still tired, darling?
	Shall we stay here another night?
Nera
	Alright, then.
	Good night...husband!
Nera
	Good morning, darling.
	Shall we get going now?
Nera
	No, you're right. We have our own room in myⓚⓛ
	I mean, in our house, don't we?
*: 
	Well, I missed out on Nera. But I'll find myself a bride, you'll see. And she'll be a beauty too!
*: 
	I still can't believe Crispin ventured into that cave all by himself. He's not the bravest boy, you know.
*: 
	Perhaps he's finally growing up. Becoming a real man at last. And it's all thanks to Nera!
Crispin
	No doubt Nera thinks I'm an utter dunce, now.
Crispin
	All I managed to do was make a complete fool of myself and cause her to worry, getting so badly burnt like that.
Crispin
	But I'll make a man of myself yet!
	I'll prove I'm worthy of her love!
Crispin
	Nera... I'm sure you'll be very happy.
Nera
	Thank you, Crispin.
	I'm sure you will be too.
*: 
	Good morning, sir! How does it feel to be a young newly-wed, then?
*: 
	Ms Whitaker left early this morning to get back
	to Stockenbarrel.
*: 
	She said she'd left all her things behind for you in your bag.
*: 
	Welcome to the Briscoletti resiⓚⓛ
*: 
	Well, no. I suppose this is your home now too,
	isn't it?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ah-ha! The happy duo! You look fine together.
	Yes, very fine!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Prince Harry and his wife left early this morning.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	He had some very interesting things to say about %O0960%Xyou, you know, %a000090%Y%a000090, you know%Z.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I hear you're travelling in search of a
	legendary hero.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Well, I believe I have just the thing for you.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You'll find some gifts from me in the two chests behind me here. They're both unlocked. The contents are yours.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Now then, my bambina. I know you'll be lonely while %a000090's away, but you'll have me and Mama to keep you company.
Nera
	Actually, Papa. We wanted to talk to you about that. You see, I... I was hoping to go with %a000090.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	What!? Has your mind turned to macaroni!?
Nera
	But when I think about what might happen to %a000090... The idea that I wouldn't be by his side is, is...
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Hmm... My bambina is a romantic like her Papa!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Very well. This is what we will do.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I own a small shrine on a little island to the west of Stockenbarrel. I call it the Pothold.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	It contains a jar, you see. I've been thinking for some time now that I'd send %a000090 there to check on its condition.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	If you can manage that little errand without getting under %a000090's feet, Nera, I'll allow you to do as you please.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Well, my bambina? That's fair, no?
Nera
	Yes, Papa. I won't get in %a000090's way.
	I'll do everything I can to help him.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Good! Here you are then, Nera. I'll give you the key to the shrine.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I'm counting on you, %a000090.
	Remember, you're family now!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I just need to know what colour the jar is.
	It's on an island to the west of Stockenbarrel. Capice?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You'll find some gifts from me in the two chests behind me here. They're both unlocked. The contents are yours.
Nera
	I wonder why Papa would have a shrine built in a place like this.
Nera
	Oh well, I suppose we should unlock the door and see what's inside.
~ Nera unlocks the shrine door. ~
~ %0%a000120 has a look at the pot. ~
~ It's glowing with a calm, blue light. ~
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ah! Welcome back!
	So it all went well, then?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I see. The jar was blue.
	Well, that's a weight off my mind.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Anyway. Never mind about that now!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	So, %a000090... Was my bambina able to
	assist you?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Really? You wouldn't be lying to me now, would you? Telling me prosciutto-pies?
Nera
	Papa, please! Going with %a000090 this time only made me more sure.
Nera
	I must be by his side! It's my place as his wife.
	Please, Papa. Say you'll let me go.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Hm... It seems you won't take no for an answer.
	Just like your Papa, eh? Very well, then. I agree.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	But don't overdo it! You know how much your papa dislikes things being overdone, and not just your mama's pasta!
Nera
	Oh, thank you, Papa!
	Thank you, thank you!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Now everything's settled, you must get going.
	The Bolognese won't make itself, eh?
	You have a legendary hero to find, %a000090.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Oh, yes. One of my ships is in dock at Lodestar Harbour at the moment. Take it! I've got plenty more!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	It's to sea-faring vessels what tiramisu is to desserts ⓚⓛ the best there is! Ready for any voyage you care to embark on. So make use of it soon!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Take care, now.
	Don't do anything crazy!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	And come home if you get tired. Your family's always here for you.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Once the world's safe again, we'll all settle down and make a good life for ourselves here, hm?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I'm not surprised! Nera can't even wield a sword, can she?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Now everything's settled, you must get going.
	The Bolognese won't make itself, eh?
	You have a legendary hero to find, %a000090.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Although it's a shame for a newly-wed couple not to take some time for a little amore before setting off on such a difficult journey.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Do you know the island just east of
	Lodestar Harbour?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	That's where the Ventuno is moored.
	My casino ship, where you were married.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	That whole extravaganza was so hectic, you didn't have any time to enjoy yourselves.
	Why don't you take a short break there now?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Just mention my name to the man who runs the
	ferry over to the ship, and he'll see that you're shown around.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	If you carry on sailing south from there, you'll come to a place called Helmunaptra.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You can start your main journey from there.
	But remember, be careful!
Romana
	I'm so happy to have gained such a wonderful son.
Romana
	You can think of me as your own mama.
	I'll always be there for you.
Romana
	Nera, don't waste any time.
	I'm expecting grandchildren, you know!
Nera
	Mama! Please!
	Hee hee!
Nera
	I expect you're tired, aren't you?
	Do you want to rest?
Nera
	Alright, then.
	Good night...husband!
Nera
	Good morning, darling.
	Shall we get going now?
Nera
	Really? You're full of energy, aren't you?
	Make sure you don't push yourself too hard, darling.
*: 
	Ah-phew, ah-phew...
Crispin
	No doubt Nera thinks I'm an utter dunce, now.
Crispin
	All I managed to do was make a complete fool of myself and cause her to worry, getting so badly burnt like that.
Crispin
	But I'll make a man of myself yet!

Nera
	Thank you, Crispin.
	I'm sure you will be too.

	It's very late, sir.
	Aren't you tired?

Debora
	Now you've married Nera, that makes me your sister-in-law. Which means you have to do everything I say, got it?
Debora
	Good. I don't need anything at the moment, though, so leave me alone.
Debora
	What did you say? I'll pretend I didn't hear that!
*: 
	Ⓠ With a hand to the soil,
	I work my honest toil,
	and listen out for gossip as I sow Ⓡ
*: 
	Chopping wood and living your life are just the same, really. The most important thing in both is
	good timing.
*: 
	I'll let you in on a little secret. I did battle with a fearful monster in a cave just west of Hay not long ago.
*: 
	You'll never guess what it was...
	A great sabrecat of all things!
*: 
	I say it was fearful, but I could tell it'd had some contact with humans. It might even have been someone's pet once.
*: 
	Come to think of it, that'd be the way to tame it again, I suppose. By using something it remembered from its old owner...
*: 
	I tell you what. If you're feeling bored, why don't you take a look at that book on the counter there?
*: 
	We have all sorts in here, you know. And they all write things in it. You travellers certainly like to keep up on your gossip, don't you?
*: 
	Oh, is that the Scuttlebutt Alledger you've got there? Oh, yes. That's full of tittle-tattle, that is.
*: 
	Keep it if you want to. It's all gossip, mind. Don't take it too seriously!
*: 
	You can't help having a few thoughts on the subject when you run an inn, you know...
*: 
	If you ask me, I'd much rather travel with a few friends than on my own. It'd be like having a family with you.
*: 
	These two lads here are both my boys.
*: 
	To tell the truth, I would've really liked to have a daughter too.
*: 
	Ssss!
*: 
	If you sail east from here, you'll spot an island just to the south.
*: 
	There's a casino ship docked there called the Ventuno where the world's rich and famous go to win even more dosh!
*: 
	I doubt you're the kind of bloke they'd let in there, mind! Ha ha ha!
*: 
	Did you buy one too?
*: 
	I thought so. You look like the type.
*: 
	They're selling ships in bottles down in the dockyard.
*: 
	They're pretty well-made. You wouldn't want to miss out on a souvenir of Lodestar Harbour now, would you?
*: 
	People are saying that they're building a huge temple or suchlike at the top of Mt Azimuth.
*: 
	It's hard to imagine how they're managing to build anything at all in a place like that!
*: 
	Travelling about by boat, are you? If you are, you might find knowing this comes in handy.
*: 
	If you follow the coast south from here and then sail right down as far south as you can go, you should come to a big desert.
*: 
	Apparently there's a huge castle somewhere in the middle of it.
*: 
	I've heard talk of that castle in the desert too.
*: 
	Some folk say there's a kind of shrine there to the legendary hero.
*: 
	'Ello, 'andsome!
	You came especially to see me, oui?
*: 
	What a nice, sweet tongue you 'ave, %A0110%Xchéri%Z%B0110%Xchérie%Z!
Bianca
	Looks like you're on a roll here, %a000090.

	Zere is no need to be 'orrible! 'Ave you never 'eard of telling ze white lies?
Bianca
	She's right, %a000090. There's no need to worry about offending me or anything!
*: 
	I hear that people come from all over the world to have a bit of fun at the casino boat that's moored on the island just east of here.
*: 
	I wish I could go. But I'd never be able to afford that kind of lifestyle.
*: 
	I'm a sailor, me. But the ships ain't been sailin' much just lately, so I'm at home a lot.
*: 
	My savings are all but dried up already,
	but her indoors never moans. I picked a
	good'un there.

	Travelling around together, are you?
	I suppose you're on your honeymoon then.
	You can't beat a good honeymoon!

	Travelling about by boat, are you? If you are, you might find knowing this comes in handy.

*: 
	%H0860%XA traveller%YTravellers%Z, are you? I was on the move myself until recently. Heading for that White King's Paradise everyone's talking about.
*: 
	But these ships in bottles I was making for fun were selling like hot cakes, so I thought to myself, ⓗHow much better can it get!?ⓘ
*: 
	Ah, you never know in this life, do you, eh?
*: 
	Ha ha! You've spotted it too, have you?

	Pretty good, eh? If you use your head, you can find the best seat in the house!
Bianca
	That's awful! Why are so many men like that!?
Bianca
	At least you're different, %a000090.
Cleo
	I'm originally from a castle in the desert far off to the south from here.
Cleo
	People at home would be surprised to find out I've become a dancing girl, that's for sure.
*: 
	Aaaaah!
Bianca
	We should probably make a move, %a000090. Now!
Nera
	%0%a000090! Let's leave these poor girls in peace!

	Step right up! Get your souvenirs here! One of these famous Lodestar ships in a bottle could be yours!
*: 
	Look at the superb construction! See the fine finish! And all for just one thousand gold coins! What d'you say?
*: 
	That's right! You'd be crazy to pass up this unbelievable offer. I'll just pop it in your bag for you.
*: 
	Oh dear! You haven't got enough cash.
	I can't discount something of this quality, you understand, %A0110%Xsir%Z%B0110%Xmadam%Z.
*: 
	Shame. But maybe next time, eh?
*: 
	Aargh! I dropped my ship in a bottle!
*: 
	You want to get onboard? I'm afraid this is a private ship. Belongs to Mr Briscoletti of Mostroferrato.
*: 
	I can't let you on, I'm afraid.
	I don't know you from Adam.
*: 
	Hey! Are you %a000090, by any chance?
*: 
	I thought as much! Mr Briscoletti sent a message that you'd be along soon.
*: 
	This be his boat. And he's given instructions that you should be allowed to use it as much as you want.
*: 
	You might want to go to the pub for a jar or two before you set sail. You could pick up all sorts of tips for where to head on your travels.
*: 
	Oh, sorry. I've obviously got the wrong man.
*: 
	There be much stronger monsters out at sea than there be on dry land.
*: 
	You mind how you go out there, eh?
Captain
	Ah! We've been waitin' for you! It's been a
	while since we were last at sea, so it's all
	very excitin'!
Captain
	Are you ready to set sail now then, Mr %a000090?
Captain
	This way then, please.
Captain
	Cast off!
	Anchors aweigh!
	Make sail!
Captain
	In your own time. Just come and let me know when you're ready.
Debora
	We need to leave. Now.
	Got it?
Debora
	I should think so too. You should only have eyes for me, you know.
Debora
	Hmm. I don't think I can have heard you correctly.
	I'll give you one more chance.
Debora
	We need to leave this place right now.

	Rodrigo Briscoletti really is a man of vision!
*: 
	Surely playing the slot machines while the ship's rocking back and forth the whole time would make you as sick as a dog!
*: 
	Mr Briscoletti's employed me to keep an eye on things and make sure no one gets out of hand.
*: 
	Welcome to Pontoon's casino ship, the Ventuno!
	Spend a little time, win a lot of money!
*: 
	People call this ship the Fortuno as well, you know. Because it brings good fortune.
*: 
	It's ever so popular with young couples
	who are in love.
*: 
	Just imagine if you could get married in a place like this!
*: 
	You'd be happy for the rest of your lives, wouldn't you!
*: 
	Some of them even get married here. Can you imagine!
*: 
	Vowing your undying love for each other in the middle of the vast expanse of sea...
	Aaah, it'd be just perfect!
*: 
	Hm? Can't you see I'm havin' a nap?
	Leave us be, would ya?
*: 
	I'm calculating the odds of winning
	on the slot machines.
*: 
	Only, my calculations and the actual results don't appear to tie up at all.
*: 
	I dunno why my 'usband's so hell bent on this gamblin' lark.
*: 
	I en't gonna tell 'im not to do it at all, o' course, but 'e's gonna have to learn to control 'imself a bit.
*: 
	You win some, you lose some.
*: 
	It's all good fun!
*: 
	I was captain of another vessel before this one, but Mr Briscoletti kept badgering me to take the
	helm here.
*: 
	I turned him down at first, but he was pretty persistent, so I caved in the end.
*: 
	That's the secret to the man's success if you ask me: he never takes no for an answer!
*: 
	The Captain's seen 'is way through five separate monster attacks in 'is time, y'know.
*: 
	As a fellow seaman, I salute 'im, I do.
*: 
	All present and correct! Nothing to report!
*: 
	Ma'am does enjoy her travelling. I've been all over the place with her.
*: 
	But the world's so dangerous these days. I can't say I'd be disappointed if she decided to stay put for a while.
*: 
	Dining under the stars with a flute of fine champagne, whilst the ebb and flow massages
	one's appetite...
*: 
	Bliss! Simply bliss! But I've had an elegant sufficiency. Any more would be a burden.
*: 
	Sorry. This is a private room for the exclusive
	use ofⓚⓛ
*: 
	Blue blazes! I, I didn't realise it was you!
*: 
	I'm ever so sorry! Mr Briscoletti did let me know, but I clean forgot.
*: 
	Were you hoping to have a rest, then?
*: 
	Very good. I hope you sleep well.
*: 
	Good morning! I trust you'll find everything you need for your entertainment and pleasure on board.
*: 
	Yes, there's always more fun to be had here!
	Just let me know when you've had enough and want to retire.
*: 
	Sorry. This is a private room for the exclusive use of Mr Briscoletti and his family.
*: 
	Oh! You're an acquaintance?
*: 
	I'm ever so sorry! Yes, Mr Briscoletti told me to be expecting visitors.
*: 
	Were you hoping to have a rest, then?
*: 
	Very good. I hope you sleep well.
*: 
	Good morning! I trust you'll find everything you need for your entertainment and pleasure on board.
*: 
	Yes, there's always more fun to be had here!
	Just let me know when you've had enough and want to retire.
*: 
	I'm sure I just stubbed my toe on something,
	but maybe I was imagining it.
*: 
	Okay, so the casino's fun. But nothing gives you more of a thrill than my dancing! That's right, isn't it? Isn't it? Tee hee hee!
*: 
	Oh, a gatecrasher! How exciting! Can you keep up with the steps?
*: 
	It pays pretty well, you know, this job.
*: 
	That guy just won't stop starin' at me!
	I'm gonna go an' punch 'im in a minute!
*: 
	One, two... One and two...
*: 
	Don't talk to me now! I'll lose the rhythm!
*: 
	Don't step on my toes when I'm dancing!
*: 
	I'm working undercover, you know. Checking up to make sure no one's cheating or anything.
*: 
	I'm employed here, you see. That's myⓚⓛ
	Oops! I forgot! I'm not supposed to tell anyone!
*: 
	That's not much of a dance, is it? I reckon the choreography needs a bit of work.
*: 
	Am I right, or am I right?
*: 
	Yeah, 'course I am. Nice one mate, you know yer stuff, you do.
*: 
	Really? Well, I s'pose I can't 'elp it if you don't know yer salsa from yer tango.
*: 
	Ow! Phew! That's a rough dance!
*: 
	I was just leaning over to get a better view when I got smacked in the face!
*: 
	Wahoo! Yeah! That's it!
*: 
	Look at 'em go! You can't beat a good, enthusiastic dance!
*: 
	Did you know the owner of this place, Mr Rodrigo Briscoletti, donates his profits to the Church?
*: 
	Looks like I lost today, then.
*: 
	Never mind. We all have our off days.
	Ha ha... Ha ha ha...
	Ha ha ha ha ha... (gulp)
*: 
	All the world's richest are on this ship.
*: 
	I don't know how they all got so wealthy.
	And that Briscoletti fellow must be raking it in too.
*: 
	This is my first time in a place like this.
	I'm afraid I don't really know what the form is.
*: 
	I was just using that machine with all the pretty pictures on it when tokens started tumbling out of it! I hope I haven't broken it.
*: 
	Wow! Look at all this!
*: 
	Can you believe how much I've won?
	I'm on fire!
*: 
	When you've been doing this job as long as I have, you can tell what a card is just by touching it.
*: 
	............
	Ha ha! I'm pulling your leg! Obviously!
*: 
	You've got to watch your tokens, you know. Every token counts!
*: 
	One token can become a hundred. And a hundred tokens can become a thousand! So watch the ones, and the noughts'll take care of themselves!
*: 
	I didn't come here because I'd strayed from the path, my child.
*: 
	No, I came here to test the strength of my connection with the Goddess. To gauge the
	impact of my prayers.
*: 
	Dear Goddess! Almighty caster of the dice of fate! Please! Just once! Let me win at Double or Nothing!
*: 
	This is the casino hall. It's got everything for your entertainment and pleasure. Slot machines, poker and the dancing girls, of course!
*: 
	You'll never get bored in here. We won't let you!
*: 
	There was a token lyin' about on the floor here before. It's gotta be around here somewhere...
~ %0%a000120 examines the area around %A0120%Xhis%Z%B0120%Xher%Z%C0120%Xits%Z feet. ~
~ There's something shiny on the floor. ~
~ It's a casino token! %H0860%X%0%a000120's%YThe party's%Z tokens increase by one! ~
*: 
	We've got every drink you can think of behind the bar here.
*: 
	They're all part of Mr Briscoletti's personal collection. He's a real connoisseur, you know.
*: 
	You think it's just a game, but you
	really have to concentrate!
*: 
	I've really been putting my mind to it, but I still can't get all the way 'round.
*: 
	Argh! I was so close! Just one roll away from
	the finish!
*: 
	If the ship hadn't rocked suddenly, the die would've stayed where it landed, and I'd have been a winner!
*: 
	Oh, blast it! You can't play without a T 'n' T ticket you know, no matter how much gold you've got!
*: 
	Ya don't wanna fink too much 'bout all them games 'n' that in the casino. Or 'bout Treasures 'n' Trapdoors. Just have fun! T'riffic!
*: 
	This is the ship's hold. It's always full, whether it's with casino prizes or passengers' luggage.
*: 
	I'll only tell you once: don't touch!
*: 
	Always worth checking if people are short of a thing or two. It's just good business sense, isn't it?
*: 
	You've gotta wonder what people need all this luggage for when they're just coming to play a bit
	of poker, haven't you?
*: 
	No! I've never shirked my duties to go gamblin' in the casino! Never!
*: 
	Ah-phew... Ah-phew that was close...
	Ah-phew...
*: 
	You hear loads of folk sayin' how much they'd like to get married here on this ship.
*: 
	I s'pose it would be pretty amazin'.
*: 
	You know, Brisc'letti's own daughter got married here not long back.
*: 
	Dear Goddess, we were busy! Runnin' around like mad things, we were. But it was a crackin' ceremony.
*: 
	You know, you look a bitⓚⓛ
	Mother of pearl, it's you! You are Briscⓚⓛ I mean, Mr Brisc'letti's daughter, aren't you!?
*: 
	I'm sorry! I din't mean to be rude or nothin'!
*: 
	I wasn't expectin' it, is all. I mean, Mr Brisc'letti always told us not to let his little bambina down here.
*: 
	I s'pose you're all grown up now, though, in't you? A proper lady, like.
*: 
	Mr Brisc'letti holds a fair few social gatherin's here on the ship.
*: 
	It's all hands on deck at times like that!
*: 
	Ev'rythin' has to be spot on, you know. You've gotta get ev'ry last detail just right.
*: 
	I am preparing ze very finest cuisine for ze passengers of zis finest of vessels.
*: 
	Ze people 'ere on board, some of zem 'ave a very particular palate.
*: 
	To 'ear zem cry out in joy when zey taste my créations, zat is my raison d'être!
*: 
	One day... One day, I'll board the Ventunozzz...
	Zzz... Zzz...
*: 
	The Ventuno's wonderful of a night too,
	you know.
*: 
	It's a time for the less lively passengers to enjoy a bit of quiet time in the casino hall.
*: 
	Ah-phew... Ah-phew...
	All aboard...for the Ventu-ew...
	Ah-phew... Ah-phew...
*: 
	(whimper)
*: 
	There's no rest for a man in my position. Night and day, I have to keep a constant vigil to make sure no one's getting out of hand.
*: 
	Look how pretty the ocean is at night.
*: 
	Ah! A shooting star! I wish I had a boyfriend!
	I wish I had a boyfriend! I wish, I wish, I wish!
*: 
	Aaah... A flute of fine champagne under the starlit sky... Bliss! Simply bliss!
*: 
	I was just filling in the ship's log.
*: 
	I can't get out of the habit, even though we don't sail out into open waters any more. It's a captain's duty, you see.
*: 
	Argh-phew... Argh-phew...
*: 
	Ah-phew...
	Nothing to report! All prezzz...
	Ah-phew...
*: 
	The shame! If I don't step up now...
	Zzz...
*: 
	I've been playing the slots so much, everything looks like fruit to me now.
*: 
	Oh, no! I can't see the dancers! All I can see is a row of spinning reels!
*: 
	Ha ha! What a win! What a win!
	I can't stop smiling!
*: 
	It's good to unwind after a hard day's winning with a bit of gentle dancing!
*: 
	Tomorrow! Surely tomorrow will be the day!
	I've got to win sometime...
*: 
	I could dance anyone off the floor in my younger days, you know. Anyone!
*: 
	Watch! Watch the master's nimbleⓚⓛ
	Ooh, ow! There goes my hip again...
*: 
	My hair's all sticky because I was out in the sea air for so long. Normally it looks great!
*: 
	I got a decent bit of shut-eye durin' the day, so I'm firin' on all cylinders now.
*: 
	I should think ma'am will be retiring soon.
*: 
	Fifteen men on a cannibox chest, Ⓠ
	Yo ho ho and a bottle of Zoomshine. Ⓠ
	Drink and the devil had done for the rest... Ⓡ
*: 
	Men's voices are so much nicer than women's.
	Deep and throaty!
*: 
	They make me go wobbly at the knees!
*: 
	No one's going to be cheating in an atmosphere like this. It's far too mellow.
*: 
	Lots of people leave the casino of a night,
	but there are still plenty of ways to enjoy yourself, you know.
*: 
	Leave me alone...
	I'm... I'm...
	(gulp)
*: 
	What a wonderful singing voice that man has.
	I had no idea casinos offered such a wide range of entertainment.
*: 
	When you've been doing this job as long as
	I have, you can make a card vanish into thin air
	if you want to.
*: 
	............
	Ha ha! No, no, no! I'm just pulling your leg!
*: 
	I was right, my child. The Goddess wishes us to stand on our own two feet.
*: 
	Now I realise that we must make our own luck.
	Maybe now I'll win at Double or Nothing!
*: 
	Really? You're on a grand adventure then,
	are you?
*: 
	This ship, the Ventuno, used to sail the open seas once, you know. Oh, yes!
*: 
	But it's too dangerous these days, of course.
	We're moored up here by Treasure Island for a while to avoid a run-in with monsters.
*: 
	Oh no! I'm out of T 'n' T tickets!
*: 
	Apparently there's a free pass you can get that lets you play as much Treasures and Trapdoors as you want.
*: 
	If I just knew where to get it... I'd pay
	anything. It'd be well worth it for unlimited
	access to the board!
*: 
	If this ship sank, it'd go down in history, I'll bet.
*: 
	I've been working on ships for a while now,
	but I can't actually swim, you know. I hope the
	ship doesn't sink!
*: 
	I told you, I'm not shirkin'!
	Ah-phew... Ah-phew...
*: 
	Et Voilà! Ze perfect flavour!
	Zzz... Zzz...
