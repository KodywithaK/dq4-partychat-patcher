Bianca
	So your mum's alive, and you need to find the Zenithian Equipment to rescue her...
Bianca
	What a task! I'll do whatever I can to help you be reunited with her soon, though.
Bianca
	You must be so happy to find out your mum's still alive, after all. Mums are so warm and gentle...
Bianca
	Sorry. I was gettin' carried away with my memories for a minute there.
Bianca
	I, er... I actually went to Whealbrook on my own once, just after the place was attacked.
Bianca
	I saw your place burnt to the ground, but I knew you must still be alive somewhere because there
	was no sign of you there.
Bianca
	I dun't know much about the lay of the land beyond this point.
Bianca
	There's prob'ly lots of strong monsters about,
	so we should watch our backs.
Bianca
	Sorry if I was a bit quiet for a while back there.
Bianca
	I was feelin' a bit overwhelmed at the idea of you goin' off and gettin' married.
Bianca
	But, at the end of the day, I just want you to be happy. I mean, you're like a...brother to me, after all.
Bianca
	You've done a good job tamin' those monsters who are taggin' along with you, eh?
Bianca
	You've always had a bit of a strange air about you. Maybe there's somethin' in that that makes 'em look
	up to you.
Bianca
	Huntin' out that Circle of Water sounds a lot more simple than our ghost-bustin' adventure all them years ago, eh?
Bianca
	To tell the truth, I was so scared that time that I thought I'd burst into tears any minute. I'm petrified of ghosts and the dark.
Bianca
	You're a lot stronger now than the last time we met.
	I en't a patch on you no more.
Bianca
	You've really filled out in the muscles department, that's for sure. You look quite a lot like Pankraz nowadays.
Bianca
	It's a shame you ended up gettin' separated from %a001210. I wonder how he's gettin' on.
Bianca
	Looks like we're done with our adventures to
	find the Circle of Water, eh? That seemed to go
	by in a flash.
Bianca
	I s'pose we'd better get that ring to its intended, eh?
Bianca
	If Nera decides she dun't want you, then I'll put my hand up and claim you instead.
Bianca
	Ha ha ha! I was only jokin'!
	You should see your face!
Bianca
	Them monsters you got trailin' about after you
	are pretty strong, eh? You probably didn't really need me.
Bianca
	I suppose we won't be able to travel together like this once you're married. I doubt your wife'd be too happy if we did.
Bianca
	That's why I insisted on comin' with you, see.
	Sorry if I was a bit pushy.
Bianca
	Walkin' about together of a night like this reminds me of our ghost-bustin' adventure.
Bianca
	You were so little back then, but you tried so hard to protect me. It was really cute!
Bianca
	Um, it's gettin' late and it's dark already.
	Shall we stay the night somewhere?
Bianca
	Great! But you're almost a married man, so I s'pose we'd better take two separate rooms, eh? Ha ha!
Bianca
	Fair enough. I suppose you en't got time to rest, eh?
Bianca
	Dun't you think we should go and deliver that ring now, %a000090?
Bianca
	Nah, I s'pose they'll all be tucked up in their beds asleep at this time of night, eh?
Nera
	It shouldn't even take a day to go and check the colour of that jar just to the north-west of here.
Nera
	I find it hard to believe that Papa would allow me to go travelling just for completing such a simple task.
Nera
	All we need to do now is tell Papa the colour of the jar, and then I can go travelling with you. I'm starting to feel all nervous!
Nera
	That shrine was very strange, don't you think?
Nera
	We must both keep the existence of that jar
	to ourselves.
Bianca
	This en't the first time we've bin travellin' together, but it feels different somehow, eh?
Bianca
	The idea of bein' with my ⓗbeloved husbandⓘ is goin' to take a bit of gettin' used to, I reckon!
Bianca
	Where are we goin', then? Part of me wants to go back and see the shape of things in Whealbrook and Roundbeck.
Bianca
	Or we could go and drop in on Harry and Maria. Then again, a bit of a flutter on the old Ventuno casino ship could be a laugh...
Bianca
	Briscoletti was on about us takin' a honeymoon,
	but you probably want to find your mum a bit sharpish, eh?
Bianca
	You dun't need to worry about me, okay? So just go wherever it is you want.
Nera
	Being able to travel around freely like this is like a dream come true.
Nera
	Every time I've been anywhere in the past, it's always been so planned out. But this time I don't even know the destination!
Nera
	Hm? Where would I like to go?
	I think I'd like to visit your hometown.
Nera
	No doubt you'd much prefer to visit the Ventuno casino ship, though? He he he!
Nera
	Looking at beautiful scenery like this makes it seem impossible that those rumours about the world ending could be true.
Bianca
	Where are we off to next, then?
	You decide, %a000090.
Bianca
	It's bin a while since I felt like this. Life in Stockenbarrel was always pretty predictable,
	you know.
Bianca
	......
Bianca
	Sorry, it's just I don't feel like chattin' sometimes.
	It dun't mean anythin's wrong, though.
Nera
	This has always been my dream. To be able to travel the world freely with someone dear to me.
Nera
	I suppose we can't afford to just let the moment take us, fun though it is.
Nera
	No, we need to focus on finding the legendary hero and rescuing your mother.
Nera
	Do stop and chat with me every now and then, won't you? I'd like it if we could get to know each other a bit better.
Bianca
	I want to go to Gotha.
	We can go, right, %a000090?
Bianca
	I feel like I might find somethin' new out about you if  we go there, see.
Bianca
	I'm startin' to get used to this man and wife lark. I hope we can keep on travellin' together like this for
	a long while.
Bianca
	You know, I really like chattin' with you, %a000090.
Bianca
	I had no idea how talkative I could be until you and I got together!
Nera
	Something about the name Gotha really gets my interest piqued for some reason.
Nera
	I'd very much like to visit there if you'd like to
	go, too.
Nera
	Um, darling...
	It's okay. Never mind.
Nera
	We've been travelling together for a while now,
	and yet I still sometimes feel all nervous and shy with you.
