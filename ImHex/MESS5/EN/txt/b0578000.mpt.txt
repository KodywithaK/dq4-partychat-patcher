Bianca
	This place is dull as ditchwater!
	Not like good old Stockenbarrel.
Nera
	Oh dear. What a terrible state the fields are in here. I wonder what happened.
%0%a001240
	The people here don't look very well, do they?
	Do you think they're hungry?
%0%a001240
	You know everything, don't you, Dad? I'd never have expected to find a village all the way out here.
%0%a001250
	Isn't the smell of the country great?
%0%a001250
	A lot of the fields in this village look like they've been trampled over or something. I wonder if they're all like it.
Sancho
	I like thees village. Ees esmall and esimple.
	Your Uncle Sancho, he likes esoiling een the plantⓚⓛ
	Eh? No, no. I mean, planting een the esoil.
Sancho
	Ees estrange, no, the atmosphere here?
	We must ask esomeone what ees happening.
Tuppence
	Pooey! This place is... Well, it really is the countryside, isn't it?
Tuppence
	Is this place on the map? Do they even make maps that are so...irrelevant?
Bianca
	Die of starvation!?
	Things are worse here than they look.
Nera
	It's hard enough work as it is trying to grow crops, without having to put up with them being ransacked like that.
Nera
	I used to grow vegetables when I was staying at the abbey, so I can understand just how soul-destroying it must be.
%0%a001240
	There are some really bad apples in the world, aren't there? It's the vegetables I feel most sorry for.
Sancho
	Argh! Ees a terrible theeng! You never do esometheeng wrong een the esoil! Ees esacred!
Bianca
	The hills? I doubt he'd be able to find any food
	up there.
Nera
	It sounds like he's on the brink of giving up. He's probably thinking of leaving so that the other villagers can have his food.
%0%a001240
	The monsters are causing problems even in a place like this. Well, not for much longer! Help is here!
%0%a001250
	Into the 'ills? Oh, she means into the hills, does she?
	Is there food in the hills then?
	There are mushrooms, I suppose...
Sancho
	............
	Ees... Ees eso esad!
Bianca
	Sounds like Granny's givin' up her share of food so the kid can eat, eh?
Nera
	I'm sure Papa would send some food parcels if I asked him nicely. But I suppose that's not a
	long-term solution.
Nera
	No. The only way to solve their problems here is to see off that monster once and for all.
%0%a001240
	But if his granny's ill, she should be eating to keep her strength up.
%0%a001240
	It's because the fields have been ransacked, isn't it? That's why she's not eating. We've got to help these people, Dad!
Tuppence
	This place really is badly off, isn't it?
	It's rather hard to be here actually.
Bianca
	This is a sorry old place. I doubt there'd be many other folk who'd stay here.
Nera
	I suppose we can't possibly expect a meal here.
%0%a001240
	This inn's in a terrible state. Oops! I'm not supposed to say things like that, am I?
Sancho
	Eef we estay the night here, ees good for the village, no? Ees gonna breeng een a few garbanzos.
Bianca
	That woman's so thin and pale. I had no idea there were folk about havin' such a hard time of it.
Nera
	Even the young women here have the most
	incredible accents.
%0%a001240
	Who's Pa? Does she mean Dad, Dad?
	I mean, does she mean Dad, Pa?
	He he he!
Bianca
	I wonder if that means the monster is even
	scarier-lookin' than the scarecrow.
Nera
	Fancy being famous for such scary-looking scarecrows! Still, I suppose you have to do what you can to protect your crops.
%0%a001240
	Terrorcrow? Does he mean the thing outside?
	Come on, Dad, let's go and look at it again.
Sancho
	Anda! We no have the espare food.
Sancho
	Eef I knew we were coming here to esuch a place, I would prepare mucha, mucha paella.
%0%a001240
	Isn't it cool? I think it's brilliant!
%0%a001250
	Hello, scarecrow. Are you doing your job properly?
	You're making sure no bad monsters come near, aren't you? Yes. Good scarecrow!
Bianca
	Blimey! He's a bit of a rough one, eh?
Nera
	Wh-What on...!? How rude!
%0%a001240
	Ow! He pushed me into the wall! Are you okay, Dad?
%0%a001250
	That man's rotten! Rotten like a bad apple!
	Rotten and stinky!
Sancho
	Esometheeng ees happening here.
	I wonder what ees the matter...
Tuppence
	Of all the nerve! Does he know who he's talking to!?
	This is %a000090! King %a000090!
Bianca
	I s'pose we can't really ignore a cry for help, eh? We'd better see what we can do.
Nera
	There's really no need for a reward.
	Is there, darling?
%0%a001240
	Kerumping a monster? I like the sound of that!
Sancho
	They, they offer us one thousand, five hundred gold when they are eso poor?
	Ees, ees eso moving! (sob)
Bianca
	We always seem to be goin' off and tacklin' some monster or other, eh?
Nera
	I seem to remember seeing a cave to the
	west of here.
%0%a001240
	I haven't got a clue what that man just said!
%0%a001250
	The west? That's where the sun goes down, isn't it? See? I'm clever!
Sancho
	These people, they are een trouble. Ees all for one and one for all, no? Come! We go west.
Tuppence
	To be honest, I'd feel a bit more motivated if I thought this monster's lair at least contained treasure or a fair maiden or something.
Bianca
	It en't attackin' people? Sounds just like one of them monsters you have trailin' about after you, eh?
Nera
	I used to think that monsters only like to eat humans, but some of them are vegetarians, you know.
%0%a001240
	It sounds like the people here don't go out much, doesn't it?
%0%a001240
	If they just went for a walk outside their village for a while, they'd soon realise there are loads of amazing monsters about.
%0%a001250
	If it turns out to be a good monster, you won't hurt it, will you, Dad?
Bianca
	Did you see that, %a000090? I can't help feelin' like I've seen that beast before.
Nera
	Ooh! Do you think that was the monster? It looked like it was tearing up the fields.
%0%a001240
	What was that!?
%0%a001240
	Something just leapt out of the fields and ran off!
	Did you see it? That must've been the monster!
%0%a001250
	............! Phew! That gave me a fright!
Sancho
	Qué!? A monster...een a town!?
Sancho
	Are you okay, friend? You are no hurt?
	Thees monster, he ees no gonna get away
	weeth thees!
Tuppence
	Looks like it was after food. It's eaten all the vegetables in that patch, look. What a mess!
Bianca
	This place gives me the willies, you know.
	It's just a little bit too quiet.
Nera
	The abbey used to be quiet like this after lights out.
%0%a001240
	It's just like being in a forest, isn't it?
	It's pitch black, and there's no one around.
%0%a001250
	Wow! Look at the stars!
	They're so beautiful again tonight.
Sancho
	The esun, ees esinking early these days.
Tuppence
	The end of another day at last. I thought that one was never going to be over! I'm exhausted!
Bianca
	They're pretty cautious for country folk, havin' their doors locked like that.
Nera
	I suppose it's fair enough that their doors are
	locked at this sort of time. Farmers do get up
	early, after all.
%0%a001240
	It's locked. Why don't we come back in the
	morning, Dad?
Sancho
	Ees late now to pay esomeone a visit, friend.
	We come back tomorrow, sí?
Bianca
	Shall we stay here tonight? It seems nice and quiet.
Nera
	It feels a bit desolate, but I suppose it can't hurt to stay over in a place like this every once in a while.
%0%a001240
	Are we sleeping here tonight?
	I, I suppose it'll be alright.
%0%a001250
	I don't care where I sleep now.
	I just want a bed!
Tuppence
	Here!? Are you serious? Oh, well. No chance of a meal tonight then, I suppose.
Bianca
	I feel like everyone's lookin' at us. I think they're a bit scared of us, you know.
Bianca
	I think they're all scared because we have %a001210 with us and he's the one who tore up their fields.
Bianca
	But he didn't mean to cause any harm, eh? Hopefully they'll come 'round and forgive him.
Nera
	I feel like the villagers are avoiding us.
Nera
	I suppose they're feeling a bit bitter because of %a001210 destroying their crops.
Nera
	Poor %a001210. When he lost you, he couldn't go back to the wild because he was too tame. He couldn't attack people.
Nera
	So that's why he ended up destroying their crops instead. He had to find food somehow.
%0%a001240
	The villagers are giving us evil stares.
	I, I don't like it.
%0%a001240
	They're not being very welcoming, are they? I mean, we came to tell them their fields are going to be okay.
%0%a001250
	I want to go back to the wagon, Dad.
Sancho
	I no like the atmosphere here.
	I, I... What eshould we do, friend?
Bianca
	There's no point tryin' to tell him %a001210 wouldn't attack people. He's in too much of a tizz to listen properly.
Nera
	I can't understand why people are so afraid of %a001210. He's so quiet and sweet.
%0%a001240
	But %a001210 would never hurt a human!
%0%a001240
	Although, he did make a bit of mess of their fields, didn't he?
%0%a001250
	He's really sorry. He didn't mean it.
	The people here should forgive him.
Sancho
	Ees no esurprising the people here, they feel
	like thees.
Sancho
	Ees, ees eso esad.
Tuppence
	I'd say the villagers would listen to any of our demands at this moment, wouldn't you?
Bianca
	So much for leavin' %a001210 behind to stop people freakin' out. Looks like they're just as scared of us as they are of him!
Nera
	He's talking about %a001210 as if he's some kind of monster.
%0%a001240
	But %a001210 would never hurt a human!
%0%a001240
	Although, he did make a bit of mess of their fields, didn't he?
%0%a001250
	He's really sorry. He didn't mean it.
	The people here should forgive him.
Sancho
	Ees no esurprising the people here, they feel
	like thees.
Sancho
	Ees, ees eso esad.
Tuppence
	I'd say the villagers would listen to any of our demands at this moment, wouldn't you?
Bianca
	That old woman seems relatively calm.
	Maybe she en't scared.
Nera
	The people here in this village seem to think of %a001210 as some kind of monster.
%0%a001240
	What, shouldn't we have let %a001210 come with us? No, that wouldn't have been right, would it?
Bianca
	At least kids en't phased by it all, eh?
Nera
	Looks like you're something of a hero in that little boy's eyes, %a000090. He he he!
%0%a001240
	The little boy isn't scared of us, but the adults are!
%0%a001250
	Tamerer? What does he mean?
Bianca
	Maybe it'd be better if we steered clear of this place from now on, eh?
Nera
	Oh dear. We don't seem all that welcome here. I think we should probably make ourselves scarce.
%0%a001240
	I don't want to stay here any more, Dad.
Bianca
	What a horrible man! It looks like he thinks you got %a001210 to terrorise the village from square one.
Nera
	How rude of him to think something like that of you! What a nasty character!
%0%a001240
	But we went all that way...
	Right down inside the cave...
%0%a001240
	And we...
%0%a001240
	............
%0%a001250
	Unbelievable! How could he be so ungrateful?
Sancho
	Maybe one day, thees señor and hees amigos, they gonna understand.
Sancho
	But now they are just angry because their fields, they are een a mess. Ees better we go now.
Tuppence
	Enough! No one speaks to King %a000090 like that! I'd like to cut him down to size, Your Majesty!
Bianca
	I feel really down in the dumps now.
Nera
	It looks like it'll be an uphill struggle trying to get these people to understand the situation.
%0%a001240
	Is it really so weird to have a monster with you?
%0%a001250
	He's not a beast. He's %a001210!
Tuppence
	Typical! The people here hardly ever take a step outside, and yet they've seen us walking around with %a001210!
Bianca
	We didn't even say we wanted the
	stupid scarecrow!
Nera
	The people here really are petrified of us,
	aren't they?
%0%a001240
	Huh? We can have the terrorcrow? Really?
	Wahoo!
%0%a001240
	Well, I wish I could get excited about it, but with everyone being so mean, it's kind of taken the enjoyment out of it.
%0%a001250
	No thank you! We don't want anything from you!
Bianca
	Yeah, it's a scary-lookin' scarecrow, alright.
	I'd rather not touch it unless I have to.
Nera
	That scarecrow's not so scary once you get used to it. At least it has a bit of character.
%0%a001240
	Let's get going, Dad.
Sancho
	Hmm... You know, whenever I look at thees escarecrow now, I gonna remember thees day
	and everytheeng that happened here.
Bianca
	This has turned out a bit nasty, eh? Still, it's nice to have bin reunited with %a001210.
Nera
	He's in shock because he feels like you must have betrayed him. Hopefully he'll come round and
	trust us sooner or later, though.
%0%a001240
	Argh! This is really starting to annoy me, Dad!
Sancho
	Ees no good for us to estay here now.
	The people, they can no trust us.
Bianca
	I'd rather just give back the money the Bailiff give us, wouldn't you?
Nera
	There's no talking to these people. If only they'd give us the chance to explain.
%0%a001240
	That's not the end of it! He doesn't understand!
%0%a001250
	He's... (sniff) He's so mean...
Sancho
	Ees because they have no money, and
	they leeve esuch a hard life. They can no
	theenk estraight.
Sancho
	Ees notheeng we can do. Ees the nature of humans.
Tuppence
	We sort out their monster problem, and let them hurl abuse at us, and they only give us fifteen hundred gold coins?
Tuppence
	It's exploitation, that's what it is! Total exploitation!
Bianca
	It's nice to finally hear a few words of thanks, eh?
Bianca
	I do feel a bit guilty, mind. Our %a001210 almost had this place on the brink of starvation, after all.
Nera
	That's nice. At least one person here in Hay feels grateful to us for what we did.
Nera
	I feel much better now. Let's just wipe the slate clean and get on with our journey.
%0%a001240
	At last! Finally someone who appreciates us.
%0%a001240
	I was starting to get really annoyed.
%0%a001250
	Did you hear that, Dad? She said thanks.
%0%a001250
	It's nice to finally hear it, isn't it?
Sancho
	Thees señora, eshe ees eso kind, no?
Tuppence
	That's all very well, but I was at least expecting a feast or something in our honour! No, that cuts no
	ice with me, I'm afraid.
Bianca
	Comin' here always reminds me of home somehow.
Bianca
	D'you think this place has somethin' to do with the underworld, %a000090? I en't too sure meself.
Nera
	It seems impossible to believe there's any such thing as the Grandmaster of the Underworld when you're in a place as peaceful as this.
Nera
	The bubbling of the water in the stream's such a comforting sound, isn't it?
%0%a001240
	This place is really tiny, but it's quite pretty,
	I suppose.
%0%a001250
	Look in the pond... Isn't it pretty?
	Heh heh heh!
Sancho
	Ees esometheeng for us to do here, friend?
Sancho
	Look at these fields! The greens, they are growing eso fast!
Tuppence
	Let's head off somewhere else, eh, %a000090?
	I'm not really a country sort of chap.
Tuppence
	There's absolutely nothing here, is there?
Bianca
	You din't really want to come here, did you, %a000090?
Nera
	You didn't really intend to come here, did you?
	I mean... Sorry, darling. It was just...just a feeling.
%0%a001240
	What's wrong, Dad? You look funny.
%0%a001240
	That old lady seems really well now.
	She's not bent over double or anything.
Sancho
	All the people, they have esmiles on their
	faces, eh? Ees a good atmosphere here
	now, no?
%0%a001240
	Huh? Inhabitabents? What does that mean?
Tuppence
	Just what I was about to ask!
	What are we doing here, %a000090?
Bianca
	Blimmin' charmin'! I know all about livin' in the
	country. I reckon I could teach him a thing or two about ploughin'!
Nera
	We used to work the fields at the abbey when I was staying there. I know how to handle a hoe and a rake, you know.
%0%a001240
	Codswallop? I can wallop fish just as well as he can, I'll bet.
%0%a001250
	There are mice in the fields, though. You might hurt them with a hoe or something if you're not careful.
Sancho
	Ees no eso easy to use a hoe, you know.
	Ees hard work.
Bianca
	Come on, %a000090!
	It wouldn't hurt to lend the bloke a hand.
Nera
	Well! We city folk have had our fair share of hardships, you know! %0%a000090 has been through more than you could possibly imagine.
%0%a001250
	ⓙE din't say ⓗdin'tⓘ, did 'e?
Sancho
	You know, the greens you grow yourself, they always taste the best.
Sancho
	You must try to grow esometheeng one day, friend.
Tuppence
	He's got that right! I'm a city fellow through and through, and the thought of working the fields doesn't exactly thrill me!
Bianca
	It's a simple little inn, eh? Still, it's nice to stay at places like this every once in a while.
Nera
	It's a bit run-down, but it has a lovely homely feel to it, doesn't it?
%0%a001240
	Mmm... Can you smell that?
	I bet dinner here tastes delicious!
Sancho
	Sí, sí. Thees ees my kind of inn.
	You can relax when ees no eso formal, no?
Bianca
	If you marry someone for love, then it dun't matter where you live. That's what I think, anyhow.
Nera
	I'd never complain as long as I was with the people
	I love. That's all that matters to me.
%0%a001240
	But you can climb trees here, splash about in the pond... What's not to like?
Tuppence
	Oh yes, I know just how the poor girl feels.
	This place takes too much of a toll on us urbanites.
Bianca
	We didn't even say we wanted the
	stupid scarecrow!
Nera
	He really is keen to get rid of it, isn't he?
	Well? Shall we take it or not?
	
%0%a001240
	Huh? We can have the terrorcrow? Really?
	Wahoo!
Bianca
	You look a bit perplexed, %a000090.
	Not that I blame you, mind.
%0%a001240
	We're always welcome, he said! Great!
Tuppence
	I may be welcome, but do I wish to be here? Hmm...
Bianca
	Yeah, it's a scary-lookin' scarecrow, alright.
	I'd rather not touch it unless I have to.
Nera
	That scarecrow's not so scary once you get used to it. At least it has a bit of character.
%0%a001240
	This terrorcrow is the best! I love it!
Sancho
	To make esuch a frightening escarecrow, they must have a very escary monster here.
Bianca
	Well, it's good that he's finally realised they were all in the wrong.
Nera
	Well at least he's finally realised you didn't do
	them wrong.
%0%a001240
	Dad, it wasn't...was it?
%0%a001240
	Wow! You're amazing, Dad. The best!
%0%a001250
	You got rid of the monster for them, Dad?
%0%a001250
	And it was a really hard time for you? Well, at least he understands you now.
Sancho
	Time ees the healer of all theengs, you know.
	Sí, sí. Ees good.
Tuppence
	I, I don't really see what he's driving at, personally. Still, never mind! Nothing to do with me, is it?
%0%a001250
	Most monsters aren't bad at all, you know.
	They're nearly all good.
Sancho
	Thees monster attacking the village, eet was %a001210? Sí, thees makes esense now.
Bianca
	It's so quiet here. I s'pose all little villages are like this of a night.
Nera
	All you can hear is the murmuring of the stream and the sound of the crickets.
%0%a001240
	It looks like everyone's asleep. Aaaaahh...
	I'm sleepy too, now.
%0%a001250
	Wow! Look at the stars!
	They're so beautiful again tonight.
Sancho
	These quiet nights, they are okay
	esometimes, no?
Tuppence
	Just walking around like this is thoroughly dull.
	Why don't we tell ghost stories or something?
Tuppence
	Or how about I regale you with the amazing
	tales of Tuppence's bravery? Hm? Oh, you're
	not interested?
Bianca
	They're pretty cautious for country folk, havin' their doors locked like that.
Nera
	I suppose it's fair enough that their doors are
	locked at this sort of time. Farmers do get up
	early, after all.
%0%a001240
	It's locked. Why don't we come back in the
	morning, Dad?
Sancho
	Ees late now to pay esomeone a visit, friend.
	We come back tomorrow, sí?
Nera
	Oh dear, the poor man!
Nera
	I, I hope he gets home alright. Maybe he's forgotten his way after such a long time.
%0%a001240
	Ten years!? No way!
%0%a001250
	Hm? Was someone just talking to us?
	I fell asleep.
Tuppence
	Lodestar Harbour's miles off!
Tuppence
	He's a pretty useless manservant, if you ask me.
	I'd let him go.
Bianca
	Shall we stay here tonight? I reckon we'd get a pretty quiet night's sleep.
Nera
	It feels a bit desolate, but I suppose it can't hurt to stay over in a place like this every once in a while.
%0%a001240
	Mmm... Can you smell that?
	I bet dinner here tastes delicious!
Sancho
	Sí, sí. Thees ees my kind of inn.
	You can relax when ees no eso formal, no?
Tuppence
	What!? We're spending the night here?
	Oh no, the beds look as hard as rocks.
Bianca
	Maybe the monster who's bin attackin' Hay hangs out in this cave.
Nera
	The monster will probably be quite aggressive because we've strayed into its lair.
Nera
	Do take care, darling.
%0%a001240
	The villagers are all working really hard to grow stuff. We should see this monster off for them.
%0%a001250
	I wonder what kind of monster it is.
	It's probably not a bad one.
Sancho
	You, you are esuch a fine man, friend!
	You accept thees cry for help, even
	from estrangers.
Sancho
	Sí, from esuch a log, esuch cheeps. You are just like your papá.
Tuppence
	Yes, I'll need a bit of monster-bashing to flesh out the Legend of Tuppence. Right, let's get on with it!
Bianca
	All them bones scattered about the place are a bit of a worry, eh?
Nera
	It's rather disconcerting seeing all the bones strewn about in here, isn't it?
%0%a001240
	There are lots of human bones in here, aren't there? Do you... Do you think the monster ate them?
Bianca
	The paths are a bit dodgy in here, eh?
	Mind where you're walkin', won't you?
Bianca
	Have you still got that ribbon I give you back when we were kids?
Bianca
	That's good. It's nice to know you've kept it
	all these years.
Bianca
	But you've got it right there! Stop teasin' me, you cheeky monkey!
Nera
	Walking along this path with all these holes everywhere is starting to make me feel rather faint.
Nera
	I'm really worried about falling, but I'll do my best to keep up with you.
%0%a001240
	Have you noticed the golden hairs on the ground here and there? They're probably from the monster.
%0%a001250
	You know that ribbon you always carry around, Dad? Is it really important or something?
%0%a001250
	I can lead us back out of here. I've been dropping sweet wrappers to mark the trail!
%0%a001250
	Huh? Uh-oh! It's too dark to see them!
	I didn't think of that.
Sancho
	Sí. Thees ees the right way. Esometimes I esee the marks of the monster's feet, or esome of eets hair on the ground.
Tuppence
	Once we've slain this beast, %a000090, what say we make a cloak or something from its coat?
Tuppence
	I bet it'd look absolutely sensational on you.
Bianca
	Oops! I hope that soldier en't fallen on his head.
Nera
	Oh dear! I hope that soldier's alright.
%0%a001240
	Uh-oh! Did we do that? What are we going to do, Dad? He'll be alright, won't he?
%0%a001250
	We're sorry! We didn't mean it!
	Don't come back as a ghost and haunt us!
Sancho
	Ees too much, thees esurprise, no?
	Thees señor, he, he escare me!
Tuppence
	It's, it's alright! Whatever's happened to him, I won't tell a soul! You can count on me!
Bianca
	Looks like soldiers are made of pretty stern stuff.
	I didn't expect him to faint, mind.
Nera
	I'm glad he's alright. I wonder where this almighty beast is lurking, though...
%0%a001240
	No monster could be a match for my Dad, no matter how strong. Right, Dad?
Sancho
	Ees no a good idea to come here alone.
	Thees señor, maybe he ees a leettle loco, no?
Tuppence
	Look at his neck. It looks a bit twisted, doesn't it?
	He must have done that when he fell.
Bianca
	You dun't think that giant sabrecat could've bin...
Bianca
	Nah. I s'pose the chances of that are pretty slim, really. Just ignore me.
Nera
	That was strange. That monster seemed to be holding back a little and not attacking with its full might.
%0%a001240
	Why doesn't that monster attack us?
%0%a001250
	You see, Dad? It's not a bad monster at all.
	You know that, don't you, Dad?
Sancho
	Ees, ees a great esabrecat, thees monster.
	You remember, friend, you used toⓚⓛ
Sancho
	Eh? You theenk ees...?
Tuppence
	Ha ha ha! The beast's scared of us!
Tuppence
	But we're not going to let it off that easily, are we, %a000090? Just think of the fur!
Bianca
	So that's the big monster? It seems a bit pitiful to me. I feel bad for goin' after it.
Nera
	Do you think that's the almighty monster? It's a bit different to how I expected. Maybe we could talk it into joining us?
%0%a001240
	It won't attack us at all.
%0%a001250
	It seems to be protecting something.
Sancho
	Friend! Be careful!
Tuppence
	It, it looks pretty tough up close, actually.
	M-Maybe I'll see you all at home, shall I?
Bianca
	%0%a001210 remembered my ribbon after all this time. That's so cute!
Bianca
	%0%a001210 has bin lookin' after Pankraz's sword all these years. Waitin' to give it back to you sometime, %a000090.
Bianca
	It's goin' to be a bit tricky explainin' this away to the folks back in Hay.
Nera
	Ooh! So this is the first monster you ever
	befriended, then?
Nera
	It must have had a terrible time of it since being parted with you. But it survived. We should be sure to praise it.
Nera
	I wonder how we can persuade the people of Hay to forgive %a001210. He did destroy their crops, after all.
%0%a001240
	What!? You used to have this monster as a pet?
	Wow!
%0%a001240
	And it remembered you from all that time ago!
	You're clever, aren't you, %a001210?
	I like you!
%0%a001240
	You must've been really lonely living in such a remote cave all on your own, %a001210.
%0%a001240
	But you'll always be with us from now on.
	Isn't that great?
%0%a001250
	Look! %0%a001210 looks so happy.
	He must've been really lonely.
%0%a001250
	Can %a001210 sleep in with me tonight?
	Please?
Sancho
	I, I no believe eet! You know, I esay to myself maybe, but... Anda! I no believe eet!
Sancho
	Ees destiny, friend. You must look after thees esabrecat, you know.
Sancho
	You no go hungry no more, %a001210!
Sancho
	Your Uncle Sancho, he gonna make you a
	beeg monster paella!
Tuppence
	That was a dirty trick, %a000090.
	You could've told us you knew the beast!
Tuppence
	Why on earth did that dirty old bit of ribbon make the beast calm down?
Tuppence
	I suppose it must've been the disgusting musty smell of it, do you think? Aah! Wh-Why do you look so angry all of a sudden!?
Bianca
	There en't nothin' we need to be doin' here.
	Time to push on to Nadiria!
Nera
	We don't have anything to do here now, do we?
	I thought you were in a hurry to get to Nadiria, darling.
%0%a001240
	Up here in the mountains all alone...
	%0%a001210 must've been really lonely.
%0%a001240
	You're really lucky, Dad. You've got so many monster pets. I haven't even got a dog.
%0%a001240
	And %a001210's so cool!
	His mane's even growing now!
%0%a001250
	I'm right, aren't I? There are hardly any bad monsters. Nearly all of them are good, aren't they?
Sancho
	Ees just one estrange theeng after the other when I travel weeth you, friend. And eet was the esame weeth señor Pankraz.
Sancho
	Maybe ees all destiny...
Tuppence
	Our task here's done already, isn't it?
	It's the perfect excuse to cast Evac!
	Come on! Evac! Evac!
Debora
	%0%a000090, I do hope you've dragged me out to the middle of nowhere for a good reason.
Debora
	The fields are in a mess, that's for sure.
	Maybe the monster's coming on the rampage
	because he's low on food too.
Debora
	There's no point heading into the hills for food.
	That's like signing your own death warrant.
Debora
	You should stop this boy from running around.
	He can't afford to build up an appetite!
Debora
	I suppose I'll put up with this place for tonight.
	You'd better find us a decent inn tomorrow, though.
Debora
	Are you looking for her ⓗpaⓘ, %a000090?
	If you are, then hurry on over to this Bailiff
	Bails's place.
Debora
	So the monster isn't intimidated by the scarecrows... Never mind. I'm sure I'll be able to terrify him
	into submission!
Debora
	That's him disqualified. Hm? From what?
	From being a potential servant of mine, of course.
Debora
	What makes him think I offered to help him out? What's he blathering on about?
Debora
	I've got a feeling I saw a cave to the west of here. Maybe that's where the monster's hiding out.
Debora
	It may not be attacking people, but it's attacking their food, which amounts to the same thing.
Debora
	Was that the famous monster?
	I'm not sure you're up to fighting him.
Debora
	There's nothing to this place. Not even a sound!
	It's far too quiet if you ask me. The silence is creepy.
Debora
	Typical country folk, locking their doors at this hour! You'd never find that in Mostroferrato.
Debora
	Are we going to stay here? If we are, I'm taking
	that decent-looking bed over there. You'll sleep anywhere, right?
Debora
	I've never had a problem with getting lots of attention, but I don't like the way they stare here. It's like they're scared of me.
Debora
	Charming! After we went to all that effort to figure out their problem for them, this is the thanks we get!
Debora
	Ha ha! It's almost worth talking to him again just to see him react like that!
Debora
	But %a001210 wouldn't do him any harm! He needn't be afraid for his life like that, the silly man.
Debora
	He doesn't seem to think we should've befriended %a001210. Not that we should care what he thinks.
Debora
	%0%a001210's one of us now. We don't need to take any notice of what anyone else says.
Debora
	Children are so innocent.
	They know no fear, either.
Debora
	There's no need for him to beg. I'll gladly stay away. Let's go, %a000090.
Debora
	What a rude little man! We have plenty of money, thank you very much. We don't need your grubby
	small change.
Debora
	I couldn't care less what they think of us.
	We haven't done anything wrong.
Debora
	You're not scared at all, are you?
	Hey! Why are you eyeing me up next to that thing?
Debora
	I'd say it's more loopy of him to believe the nasty rumours about us than it was for him to have trusted us in the first place.
Debora
	I don't need it and I don't want it!
	They can keep their stupid money.
	We're leaving, %a000090. Right now!
Debora
	At least there's one person here that isn't a complete idiot. Huh! What a load of bumpkins!
Debora
	I don't imagine I'd have much luck finding myself a nice new outfit here.
Debora
	This pond's quite nice. We had a bit of water like this near our house, so I used to bunk off my studies and hang around there a lot.
Debora
	What's wrong with you?
	You look like a fish out of water.
Debora
	You're not going to let him mock you like that, are you? Get ploughing and show him how it's done!
Debora
	You may not mind being laughed at, but it reflects badly on me. Get ploughing and show him how
	it's done!
Debora
	Mmm... Something smells nice.
	It's making me feel hungry.
	Shall we stay here tonight?
Debora
	If I lived here, I'd have to open a clothes shop.
	And a cosmetics shop. Oh, and a casino, of course.
Debora
	If it hadn't been for the monster, there wouldn't even be a terrorcrow for us to have as a souvenir.
Debora
	Did you come here just so you'd be shown a bit of gratitude? If that's all, then let's get going!
Debora
	You're taking that scarecrow with you?
	You do some very odd things at times, you know.
Debora
	You've had a bit of a hard time of it with one thing or another, haven't you?
Debora
	It should all be a breeze now that you're married to me, though.
Debora
	What are we doing here? I don't imagine this is the kind of place Nimzo will show up. Let's go somewhere more interesting.
Debora
	Typical country folk, locking their doors at this hour! You'd never find that in Mostroferrato.
Debora
	Watch and learn. Apart from the getting lost part, I mean. That's how a servant should behave.
Debora
	Mmm... Something smells nice.
	It's making me feel hungry.
	Shall we stay here tonight?
Debora
	Stay a bit closer, will you? I don't want that monster coming and attacking me.
Debora
	Those bones dotted about the place...
	They're the real thing, aren't they?
Debora
	There are holes all over the place.
	You'd better watch where you're walking.
Debora
	If we're going to fall down a hole, you're going first. And you're going to break my fall! I won't look too kindly on you if you don't.
Debora
	Do you think that soldier's alright? He's a bit of a wimp, isn't he? I reckon you could fall down a hundred times and still live to tell the tale.
Debora
	He's the one who gave us a fright, not the other way around! I'd have chucked you down the hole again if you made me jump like that!
Debora
	So that's the famous monster? Hmm... Having a magnificent creature like that as a pet would probably reflect quite well on me.
Debora
	The poor baby's had to fend for himself all
	these years.
Debora
	It's all okay now, though. I'm going to take good care of him from now on.
Debora
	%0%a001210's one of us now.
Debora
	It doesn't matter what the bumpkins in Hay make of it. You have to protect him no matter what, %a000090.
Debora
	You don't think this is Nadiria, presumably?
	Then let's move on!
Debora
	She's very skinny, isn't she? Must be because she's not eating a decent diet.
Debora
	I suppose we'll just have to stay here tonight.
	Just make sure this doesn't happen again tomorrow.
Debora
	That old woman has courage. I'll bet she was a feisty girl like me back in her day.
Debora
	Maybe we should take it as our reward.
	It could come in useful.
Debora
	Urgh! I don't want to carry it, though.
	That's your job, %a000090. Got it?
Debora
	You take care of this, okay?
Debora
	I suppose all they see is that %a001210 destroyed their crops, so it stands to reason that they're scared to see us with him.
Debora
	You'll be able to take care of a monster or two,
	won't you, %a000090? I can just sit back and spectate.
Debora
	That's weird. Why doesn't it attack me?
	Is it scared of me?
Debora
	...Hey! Why are you just standing there too?
	Aren't you going to fight it?
Debora
	No! Really? You know this monster from years ago? Then hurry up and make him one of my servants!
