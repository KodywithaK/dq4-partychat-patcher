	Look, Dad! It's a Treasures & Trapdoors board!
%0%a001240
	I love T 'n' T just as much as you do! Is that why you brought me here?
%0%a001250
	Have you got a T 'n' T ticket, Dad?
	I'd love to have a go!
%0%a001250
	Of course! We've got a free pass so we can play as many times as we like! That's okay, right?
%0%a001250
	Hmm. This is a tricky one.
	I wonder which way to move.
Sancho
	When I ees travelling weeth señor Pankraz, we find many boards of T 'n' T. But we never estop to play, you know.
Sancho
	I no put the espoon een. Ees good. Ees like the
	fiesta. Sancho, he likes the fiesta almost as
	much as the paella!
Tuppence
	This is a big T 'n' T board. Quite an achievement for whoever built it, I'd say.
Tuppence
	You must let me try, %a000090! I've got lucky fingers, you know. I'll win us something good, trust me!
Bianca
	I'm not really very good at T 'n' T. I never seem to roll a good throw.
Bianca
	It can't hurt to let our hair down every once in a while. We could have a game here before movin'
	on, eh?
Nera
	I absolutely adore T 'n' T. It's so much fun
	rolling the dice!
Nera
	It's a shame that only one of us can go up on
	the board. It's so tense having to watch from
	the sidelines!
%0%a001240
	You defeated a bad monster here once, didn't you, Dad? You're cool!
%0%a001250
	Has that skeleton been left here all on his own?
	Poor thing!
Sancho
	You can walk all around thees board, sí?
	Ees a good idea to esee what you must do
	before you estart the game, no?
%0%a001240
	Wow! He made this place all on his own?
%0%a001250
	Wouldn't it have been easier to build some
	stairs so he could get out, rather than
	building a T 'n' T board?
Sancho
	Thees man, he make esometheeng from notheeng, eh?
	Ees a good quality, thees.
Tuppence
	Some people would have probably just given up the ghost if they fell down a hole like that.
Tuppence
	We're lucky that it was someone like him instead. Now, let's have some fun!
Bianca
	He certainly rolls with the times, eh? Fancy buildin' a T 'n' T board just because he got stuck in a hole!
Nera
	It's understandable that he felt the need to do something to ease his boredom. I was so bored I could have cried during those years as a statue.
Debora
	I don't dislike T 'n' T, but I'm not very good at it.
	If only beauty could influence the roll of a die!
Debora
	It's good to come up for air sometimes. Come and hang around with me here for a while if you want to take a break from the game.
Debora
	If he was going to build something, why didn't he build some stairs so he could get out? I don't see his logic at all!
