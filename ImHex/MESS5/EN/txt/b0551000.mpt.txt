	Looks like that gold bauble just doesn't cut it for some reason. What do we do now, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Does this mean we get to go back to the Faerie Palace? Yay! We're so lucky!
Sancho
	I can no esee anytheeng wrong weeth thees bauble.
	Ees gold and ees round. What ees the problem?
Tuppence
	After all that effort we went to! You'd think we deserved a little credit at least.
%0%a001240
	Do you think this tiny little gold orb really has the power to make the castle float up in the sky again?
%0%a001240
	We've been away quite a while now.
	I hope Dr Agon's not too lonely.
%0%a001250
	I'm positive this will make everything okay!
	We have to hurry and show it to Dr Agon!
%0%a001250
	The castle's giving off a really fidgety air, like it's on tenterhooks. Maybe it knows we have the orb.
Sancho
	Hmm... You no theenk thees orb, eet looks exactly the esame, just like the bauble?
Sancho
	I no understand about the orbs and the baubles.
	Ees all just balls to me. We must eshow thees one to Dr Agon, and esee what he esays.
Tuppence
	Well! It seems I'm about to bear witness to the momentous moment when this legendary castle
	once again takes to the skies!
Tuppence
	To think I was involved in finding the orb...
	Er! Don't mind me! Just thinking out loud.
%0%a001240
	Did you see that, Dad? The castle's floating! It really is floating! Let's go and have a look outside.
%0%a001250
	So standing on that stone makes the castle fly!
	Ooh, how exciting!
Sancho
	Thees señor Agon, he ees eslippery like the eel, no?
Tuppence
	Leave things up to us?
Tuppence
	Surely he doesn't mean we can just do whatever we want with the place!?
%0%a001240
	Dr Agon must've stopped the clock too, during all those years going round and round in the Diggery Pokery. Otherwise he would've starved to death!
%0%a001250
	So they stop the clock and go into hibernation?
	I had no idea Zenithians could do such a thing!
Sancho
	These people from Zenithia, they are estrong like the Goddess, no?
Tuppence
	Those Zenithians sound like a crafty bunch.
	Or should I say ingenious?
%0%a001240
	He doesn't know Dr Agon? That's weird. Maybe he's a bit confused because he just woke up.
Tuppence
	I knew it! I've been thinking he was a bit suspicious all along. I mean, he doesn't have wings for starters!
%0%a001240
	It's a bit nerve-racking moving the castle about
	the place. We'd never be able to afford to pay
	for any damage.
%0%a001250
	I can't help feeling a bit bad about landing the castle on the ground. I mean, Zenithia's supposed to float up above the clouds, after all.
%0%a001240
	The ⓗrearward chamberⓘ? He means at the back of the fireplace, right? I wonder what the old man can be doing back there.
%0%a001240
	This is from the Yggdrasil tree?
	A tiny little sapling like this?
%0%a001250
	It's so tiny and delicate!
	Can I give it some water, Dad?
%0%a001250
	This tiny sapling's done so well in all that water.
	It's a determined little thing.
Sancho
	They esay you can breeng esomeone who has passed away back from the dead weeth the leaf of Yggdrasil.
Sancho
	But thees ees just a sapling. Eet no has esuch estrong power yet, I believe.
Tuppence
	If we can keep this sapling going, we'll have all the Yggdrasil leaves we could possibly need! Now we can fight to the death without having to worry!
%0%a001240
	ⓗThe darkness spreadethⓘ... I think that means
	we'd better hurry, Dad.
%0%a001250
	That poor sapling, confined to such a tiny pot!
%0%a001250
	Once we've defeated Nimzo, we'll have to make
	sure it's moved to a nice big place with lots and
	lots of sunshine!
Sancho
	Sí, ees just the esapling, but ees from the Great World Tree. Eef you no look after eet well, the Goddess, eshe gonna make you pay!
%0%a001240
	A present? We're not supposed to take presents from strangers. But I suppose it's okay if you're here, Dad.
%0%a001240
	I didn't know there were faeries here too. Do you think Zenithians and faeries are all good friends?
%0%a001250
	Is that grass Yggdrasil? Ooh...
Sancho
	Uf! The dew of Yggdrasil, ees a very valuable theeng.
%0%a001240
	That's not fair! Why can we only have one lot at
	a time? It'd be much better if we could takes loads of it!
%0%a001250
	We'll have to make sure we use the bit of Yggdrasil dew we have carefully then, Dad.
Sancho
	Sí. Ees true. Eef you have too much of esometheeng like thees, you forget the true value of life.
Tuppence
	You'd think she could just slip us a few extra lots out of goodwill, wouldn't you? We are fighting for world peace, after all.
%0%a001240
	The Zenith Dragon? Sealed away powers?
	What is the old man on about!?
%0%a001250
	The Zenith Dragon is the god of this world, isn't he? I've read all about him.
Sancho
	Qué? Another tower? My back, ees no een esuch good eshape, you know. But you no worry about me. Olé! Let's go!
Tuppence
	You don't think he's dangerous, do you? I mean, why would he be holed up in a place like this?
%0%a001240
	Centuries? Wow! I didn't realise this place
	was so old.
%0%a001250
	Have you ever met the Zenith Dragon, Dad?
	I've only ever seen pictures of him in books.
Sancho
	Then we must find thees Zenith Dragon, sí?
Tuppence
	Are humans really all that noble? I'd say gods have the edge there, myself.
%0%a001240
	Zenithia is certainly a fairly tricky place to find your way around!
%0%a001240
	I wonder if this place will ever be as grand as it used to be before it fell out of the sky. I'd love
	to see it brought back to its former glory.
%0%a001250
	The castle seems much happier now. Zenithia's supposed to be in the sky, after all. It's bound to dislike being underwater.
%0%a001250
	Zenithia used to be much, much higher all those
	years ago, didn't it? We're lucky we didn't have to climb so high.
Sancho
	The water, eet has almost all drained away now.
	And you can hear the voices too. Ees, ees esuch a happy time.
Tuppence
	I'll be able to hold my head up high when we get back to Gotha, so I will! There's not many folk who can say they've been to Zenithia.
%0%a001240
	What a long ladder!
	And it's really dark too...
%0%a001250
	I'm okay. As long as I don't look down, I'm okay.
%0%a001240
	Look, Dad! There are clouds underneath the castle! That's cool!
%0%a001250
	The castle isn't going to suddenly move or anything, is it? It's totally safe, right?
Sancho
	Now, when you look at eet again, ees a very grand building, no?
Tuppence
	It's rather impressive seeing the castle afloat
	like this.
Tuppence
	Certainly something you have to see to believe.
