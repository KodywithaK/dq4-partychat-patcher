%0%a001240
	I know about Coburg! Coburg and Gotha have always been good friends, haven't they?
%0%a001240
	You and Prince Harry used to travel about together, didn't you? I wish I could've come
	along with you.
%0%a001250
	Um, Sancho always says he doesn't much fancy the idea of visiting Coburg.
%0%a001250
	This is the one castle we didn't visit when we were travelling around with him.
%0%a001250
	What a grand-looking castle! But the people live outside the castle walls. Do you think that's safe?
Sancho
	My Majesty. You feel only the nostalgia now you return to Coburg, sí?
Sancho
	But for your Uncle Sancho ees, ees...
Sancho
	I know ees loco, but for me, being een Coburg ees eso hard. My heart, ees breaking, you know?
Tuppence
	I understand that you're rather pally with the royal family here, %a000090.
Tuppence
	I'm here as a soldier representing the Kingdom of Gotha. I'll do my best not to put you to shame, sir!
Bianca
	Looks like Coburg's bin pretty peaceful ever since that kerfuffle all them years ago. That must be a relief to you, eh?
Nera
	Prince Harry and King Wilbur seem to be doing an excellent job here. The place has a very warm feel to it now.
%0%a001240
	She's pretty clever for a little girl, being able to introduce the place like that.
%0%a001240
	You don't think we've got any impostors with us, do you? You're the real thing, aren't you, Dad?
Sancho
	When you go missing, friend, I heard señor Harry, he was eso worried.
Sancho
	You eshould go to esay buenos días to the señor, My Majesty.
Nera
	The soldiers of Gotha really did scour the world looking for us, didn't they?
Bianca
	Prince Kendrick? You dun't think that could be Harry's son, do you?
Nera
	I wonder if the prince he was talking about could be Harry's son. We'll have to go and find out!
%0%a001240
	I'm always good, so no one would have to worry if I became king!
%0%a001250
	I don't like rough boys. They pick up insects and things and throw them at you. It's disgusting!
Sancho
	You know, I heard the rumours that thees Kendrick, he ees the leettle diablo, just like hees father, señor Harry, was when he was young.
Bianca
	Huh. We seem to come across types like that all over the place, eh?
Nera
	It's wrong to steal things from people, no matter what the circumstances.
Nera
	Imagine how upsetting it must be to find something you hold dear has gone missing.
Nera
	Oh dear! I've just remembered that we're always rummaging through people's cupboards! I hadn't thought about it like that before.
%0%a001240
	Hey! He disappeared! I doubt he'll get up to no good again, though. Not after we taught him a lesson.
Sancho
	No, friend! You no put yourself een danger!
	You must call for the guards and leave thees to them.
Tuppence
	Hm, he's certainly a fast-moving character. What was the treasure he took, anyway?
%0%a001240
	Yikes! That armour's pretty scary-looking.
	I'm not sure I want it.
Sancho
	Why ees esuch a theeng here in Coburg?
%0%a001240
	I like staying over in lots of different places.
%0%a001240
	But the best place of all is at home, with you and Mum and %a001250 nearby.
%0%a001240
	Which way's west again? I wonder if that's a cave we've not been to yet.
%0%a001250
	Even if there are lots of monsters, we should be okay if we fight with good in our hearts, right?
%0%a001250
	I wish I could be more like you, Dad. It's amazing how you can get so many monsters to stop being bad.
%0%a001240
	Wow! You're famous, Dad! That's so cool!
Sancho
	You are no just a friend!
	You are the esaviour of thees country.
	But thees esoldier, he no know eet, eh?
Tuppence
	He he! How grand! Being with you makes me a friend of Prince Harry's by extension.
Tuppence
	...Sorry. I'm afraid I got rather carried away with
	the notion.
Bianca
	Religious folk often come out with things like that, eh? I wonder if she can sense Grandmaster Nimzo.
Nera
	I can feel it too, so much that it hurts. We must hurry to Nadiria before it's too late.
%0%a001250
	I'm really scared too. Maybe my bad dreams will come true and I'll get gobbled up!
Tuppence
	I do love to see a nun in uniform, I must say. It's a habit I just can't shake, ha ha ha!
Bianca
	Folk all over the world seem to be at the end of their tether with their kids. It goes with the territory, eh?
Bianca
	I think we've got off pretty lightly in comparison.
Nera
	Antics like that are just part of a child growing up. I wish I'd been a bit more that way inclined myself sometimes.
Sancho
	The children, they learn from their madre and their papá, you know.
%0%a001250
	How come you look so happy, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Are you finding it funny that Harry's son is causing him trouble?
%0%a001240
	Maybe he's only nice to girls. That's weird!
%0%a001250
	I wouldn't mind being friends with him if he was nice to me too.
Tuppence
	This Kendrick character obviously has his head screwed on if he's realised at his young age that it's best to befriend the girls.
Bianca
	He certainly dun't pull no punches, eh? Fancy puttin' mice on people's heads! Ha ha ha!
Nera
	I wonder if %a001240 and %a001250 would've done things like that if we'd brought them up all their lives.
%0%a001240
	Mice, eh? Maybe I'll give that a try sometime.
	...Hm? Er, nothing. Never mind.
%0%a001250
	But mice are so cute. Why would anyone say they hate them?
%0%a001240
	What a funny name he has. He sounds very clever.
Sancho
	These escholars and fortune-tellers, they are all the esame. They talk and they talk and they talk, sí? Anda!
%0%a001240
	I'm going to find it! Yep, I'll find that cape and then give it to you as a present!
%0%a001240
	That cape's just right for you, Dad. It's good that we found it.
Sancho
	You must be careful! You no go too close to thees Kendrick, okay?
%0%a001250
	Wow! I've not seen a bump that big in ages!
Bianca
	Blimey, that's quite a sacrifice, eh?
Bianca
	King Wilbur must be really determined to make things work here.
Nera
	It's a very noble intention, but it's rather sad, don't you think?
Nera
	He's basically saying that he'll give up the idea of sharing his life with a woman he loves for the sake of his kingdom.
%0%a001240
	Why would getting married cause a power struggle? Is marriage a bad thing?
%0%a001240
	Hmm... I don't get what grown-ups are on
	about sometimes.
Sancho
	Thees, what happened weeth the fake señora Queen, eet had a beeg effect on señor Wilbur.
Sancho
	He ees young, but he ees a very careful man.
Bianca
	Hm, havin' the throne up high makes it look pretty important, eh?
%0%a001240
	Thrones are really soft and comfortable.
%0%a001240
	Bertie used to let us sit on his every now and then.
Sancho
	You know, I believe eso estrongly that señor Harry, he gonna become king.
Sancho
	But he ees no greedy, eh?
	He ees like you een thees way, sí, friend?
Tuppence
	There aren't many soldiers about. Maybe they
	don't see the need because their castle walls
	here are so splendid.
Sancho
	Come, friend. Look at me.
	Sí...sí...
	Okay!
Sancho
	Now you have no hair een the wrong place, and your clothes, I check they are ironed okay.
	Ees okay for you to esay hola to the King now.
%0%a001240
	Is that King Wilbur? He's a lot younger than I expected.
Sancho
	Sí! I forget! Señor Wilbur, he esend hees congratulations for your return to Gotha.
Sancho
	I must esend the letter to thank heem when we are next home.
%0%a001240
	I want to be like you, Dad. It must be nice having so many people being grateful to you like that.
%0%a001240
	What's his problem!? I'm bigger than him, so he shouldn't talk to me like that!
%0%a001250
	He looks like a bit of a bully. I hope we don't have to spend much time around him.
Sancho
	You no esay that I esay thees, okay?
	But thees boy, he ees like thees only
	because of hees parents.
Tuppence
	I say! What a cheek! Look at him, standing there blocking our view of a beautiful young woman!
%0%a001240
	That kid just doesn't know when to shut up,
	does he?
%0%a001250
	I've got plenty of animal and bird friends.
	I don't need any more, least of all him!
Sancho
	You know, %a001240 and %a001250, they never talk to me like thees. Never!
Sancho
	Now you esee, no?
	I no let %a001240 and %a001250 become like thees. I raise them like the good children, sí?
Sancho
	My Majesty! You eshould breeng them here and eshow thees young one how to behave!
Tuppence
	Maybe I should stand in for the prince, %a000090? No, no, I was only joking!
Sancho
	Qué? He no remember!?
Sancho
	Eef he ees no making eso much trouble when he was young, señor Pankraz, he would no have to look after heem and, and... (sob)
Sancho
	I hope thees kid, he ees no making %a001240 cry.
Bianca
	What's up, %a000090? You look worried.
	I'm sure it'll be okay, though. Just relax.
Nera
	Maybe our children are a little bit too quiet.
Nera
	It could be quite a good experience for them, spending a bit of time with little Kendrick.
Tuppence
	So she's called Maria...
	A beautiful name for a beautiful woman. Haa...
Tuppence
	I could stand here listening to Maria's lovely voice all day long.
Tuppence
	I'd happily be a cat if I had to. As long as I could stay here, near her.
Sancho
	%0%a001240 and thees kid Kendrick, they are eso differⓚⓛ
	Er... No! Ees notheeng. Perdón.
Bianca
	Harry and Maria look a bit older than before, eh? Not like us!
Nera
	I feel a bit like I've been left behind when I look at Harry and Maria.
Nera
	If only we could get back all those years we lost.
Tuppence
	I'd be more inclined to go off hunting for Kendrick
	if he were a princess with some resemblance to
	his mother...
Sancho
	Children, they are eso quick. Thees ees the problem.
	Uf! Where are they?
Sancho
	You no theenk thees Kendrick, he ees bullying my %a001240 and %a001250, eh?
Bianca
	I feel a bit funny bein' apart from the kids. I just can't seem to relax! Let's hurry up and find 'em!
Bianca
	I wonder where the kids have got to.
Nera
	I'm sure they won't have left the castle, so we probably don't need to hurry too much...right?
Nera
	I never imagined I'd feel so uneasy being apart from the children.
Nera
	Let's find them quickly. I don't want to let them out of my sight again.
Tuppence
	Children are very good at the old hide-and-seek, you know. We might not be able to find them.
Sancho
	No. They are no here.
	You theenk we find them esoon?
Sancho
	They no go outside, eh?
	Eso where are they?
%0%a001240
	I told him I didn't want to be his lackey, but he said he'd start crying if I didn't go and get the badge.
%0%a001240
	I wonder where he can have disappeared to.
%0%a001250
	Kendrick's such a spoilt little brat!
	I don't like him one bit.
%0%a001240
	It's really weird. We weren't gone long enough for him to have time to leave the room.
%0%a001250
	Can't we just leave without finding him?
	No, I suppose that would be a bit rude.
Sancho
	Ees because señor Pankraz, he went to look for thees Prince Harry... Ees because of thees, that he, he...
Sancho
	............
Sancho
	I no want esometheeng like thees to happen.
	Thees ees why I no want to come here.
Tuppence
	This must be terribly hard on Maria, the poor thing.
Tuppence
	Maybe they should tie a bell around his neck so he'll be easier to find next time.
Sancho
	No. They are no here.
	You theenk we find them esoon?
%0%a001240
	How did you know about the stairs? No way! Harry played the same trick on you when you were little?
Sancho
	Ees because of these estairs...
%0%a001240
	Yikes! Did you see him being pulled along by the ear like that? It looked really painful!
%0%a001240
	I know! Let's make a secret staircase in Gotha too! That'd be fun.
%0%a001250
	What's wrong, Dad? You look a bit shocked and you've gone all sweaty.
%0%a001250
	There's no way I'd ever become his lackey! I suppose I might just about consider being his friend, but that's it.
Sancho
	Uf! Now I estop worrying, esuddenly I feel
	eso tired.
Tuppence
	It makes one rather anxious about the future, eh? We're quite lucky over in Gotha, really.
%0%a001240
	Maybe Kendrick doesn't have many friends. I haven't seen any other boys inside the castle.
%0%a001240
	Maybe I should be Kendrick's friend. I don't like him all that much, though.
%0%a001250
	I much prefer our castle in Gotha to this one.
Sancho
	Hahh... Just being here een thees castle, eet makes me eso tired.
Tuppence
	The people of Coburg are observing me. I must perform well, for the honour of the soldiers of Gotha is in my hands!
%0%a001240
	I know about Coburg! Coburg and Gotha have always been good friends, haven't they?
%0%a001240
	I like this place. You like it too, right, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Um, Sancho always says he doesn't much fancy the idea of visiting Coburg.
%0%a001250
	This is the one castle we didn't visit when we were travelling around with him.
%0%a001250
	It's a really big castle, isn't it? You'd think they'd let the townspeople live inside like we do in Gotha.
Sancho
	You feel only the nostalgia for Coburg,
	sí, friend?
Sancho
	But for your Uncle Sancho ees, ees...
Sancho
	I know ees loco, but for me, being een Coburg ees eso hard. My heart, ees breaking, you know?
Tuppence
	I understand that you're rather pally with the royal family here, %a000090.
Tuppence
	I'm here as a soldier representing the Kingdom of Gotha. I'll do my best not to put you to shame, sir!
Bianca
	I'm sure it'll all be okay. Harry's a lot different to how he used to be, after all, eh?
Nera
	Yes. I suppose Harry only changed for the better because of everything he went through.
Nera
	Maybe Kendrick would turn over a new leaf if he had the same kind of experience, but that seems a terrible thing to wish on the boy.
%0%a001240
	Is he really going to be king? He doesn't seem like he's cut out for it.
%0%a001250
	Urgh! Can you imagine that little brat ruling a kingdom!? He'd probably try to turn everyone
	into his ⓗlackeysⓘ!
Sancho
	Ees no my problem, but for me, I worry about the future of Coburg. Uf, sí... Ees a worry. Heh heh heh.
Bianca
	Maria seems really happy.
Nera
	Maria is still as beautiful as ever, even though she has aged a bit. It's probably because Harry loves her so much.
%0%a001240
	You don't need to worry about a thing, Dad!
	We'll always be along to help you out.
%0%a001250
	Is it really such a difficult journey, Dad? It's not difficult for me. As long as you're with me, everything's fine.
Tuppence
	If only we could stay and chat with her a
	little longer.
Bianca
	I'll second that. No more disappearin', d'you hear?
	...I s'pose I'm hardly one to talk!
Nera
	Yes, no more going missing.
	It was terrible being split up like that.
%0%a001240
	It's Kendrick he should worry about going missing, not you! Right, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Are you going to come here again, then? Maybe I'll stay at home in Gotha when you do.
Sancho
	I esorry eef I always complain, but ees hard
	for me to estay here eso long, you know?
Bianca
	I s'pose he en't all bad. A typical boy, really.
Nera
	He he he. See! He means well, despite his rough-and-tumble ways.
%0%a001240
	Kendrick's really weird. Why does he always talk to people so rudely?
%0%a001250
	He should apologise properly, rather than trying to buy us off with a silly present!
Sancho
	Anda! Next time, we no have the fun and the games, eh?
Tuppence
	It's hard to believe that the beautiful Maria could give birth to that creature. Urgh!
Bianca
	I s'pose he en't all bad. A typical boy, really.
Nera
	He he he. See! He means well, despite his rough-and-tumble ways.
%0%a001240
	Kendrick's really weird. Why does he always talk to people so rudely?
%0%a001250
	I could never be friends with someone who speaks to people like that.
Sancho
	You know, next time we are here, your Uncle Sancho, he gonna teach thees kid esome manners.
Tuppence
	It's hard to believe that the beautiful Maria could give birth to that creature. Urgh!
%0%a001240
	I wonder what the souvenir could be! Let's go and have a look, Dad.
%0%a001250
	Oh! Do we have to go to Kendrick's room?
Bianca
	You could've come and got it loads of times if you'd wanted to. Fancy bein' so disinterested!
Nera
	How nice of him to keep it safe for you all these years. If only we'd come to collect it sooner.
Sancho
	Eef ees possible, I no want to have the theengs from Coburg around me, por favor.
Tuppence
	I heard about this souvenir from fellow soldiers who visited Coburg in the past.
Tuppence
	Prince Harry was determined to give it to you in person, so he insisted on hanging on to it.
Tuppence
	Maria's so lovely. I know she's someone else's wife, but I can settle for admiring her from afar.
%0%a001240
	A music box maker! We had one of those at Gotha once. He was really amazing.
Bianca
	You never seem to want to talk much about it.
Bianca
	But I can see that an awful lot happened to you in the time we were apart.
Bianca
	I can't tell you how glad I am that you made it through everythin' alive, %a000090.
Nera
	To think Harry kept all of those feelings to himself!
Sancho
	Sí, señor Harry, he has become a fine,
	estrong man.
Sancho
	But eet must be like thees.
	Otherwise, señor Pankraz, he, he... (blub)
%0%a001250
	Were you really once a slave? Oh, Dad!
	Thank the Goddess that you're still alive!
%0%a001240
	I knew you'd had a hard time of it, Dad, but I didn't realise it was that bad.
%0%a001240
	I'm going to grow up strong and brave like you, and I won't let anything get the better of me, either!
Tuppence
	I'll bet there aren't too many other royals who've had experience as slaves in their lives! In fact, I'd wager it's just you and Prince Harry.
Bianca
	I dunno if it's because I read that message of his, but Harry seems really special now.
Bianca
	What a great souvenir. Our weddin' souvenir dun't look like much in comparison, eh?
Nera
	I don't think I've ever seen such an exquisite
	music box.
Nera
	And it's all the better because it was made to thank people who'd come to share in their celebrations.
Sancho
	The señor who ees king of Coburg before, thees ees a good amigo of señor Pankraz.
Sancho
	Eef the eson of a friend of señor Pankraz, he go missing, señor Pankraz, he would do anytheeng to find heem.
Sancho
	Eso you esee... Eef only señor Pankraz, he was no esummoned to Coburg that time, he would
	no be... He would no be... (sob)
%0%a001240
	What was the souvenir from your wedding, Dad?
%0%a001240
	Buns!? Buns!? But that's really dull!
%0%a001240
	Hey! The hollow in the lid looks just the same size as that sapphire, don't you think?
%0%a001250
	What a pretty music box! It looks just like a jewellery box, doesn't it?
Bianca
	Maria seems really happy.
Nera
	Maria is still as beautiful as ever, even though she has aged a bit. It's probably because Harry loves her so much.
%0%a001240
	You don't need to worry about a thing, Dad!
	We'll always be along to help you out.
%0%a001250
	Is it really such a difficult journey, Dad? It's not difficult for me. As long as you're with me, everything's fine.
Tuppence
	If only we could stay and chat with her a
	little longer.
Bianca
	Harry was a bit of a pain when he was younger, wasn't he? I guess it's in the blood, then!
Nera
	I can't help thinking that Kendrick is just like
	his father.
%0%a001240
	Oh! Is Kendrick really just like Harry was when he was young?
%0%a001240
	Then you'll have to give me some tips on how to get on with him better!
%0%a001250
	Here we are again. I would've much preferred to stay at home in Gotha.
Sancho
	Ees no easy for señor Harry, I theenk.
%0%a001240
	I know about Coburg! Coburg and Gotha have always been good friends, haven't they?
%0%a001240
	Aaaah...
	I'm a bit sleepy all of a sudden.
%0%a001250
	Um, Sancho always says he doesn't much fancy the idea of visiting Coburg.
%0%a001250
	This is the one castle we didn't visit when we were travelling around with him.
%0%a001250
	Ooh! How pretty! Look at all the stars!
Sancho
	My Majesty. You feel only the nostalgia now you return to Coburg, sí?
Sancho
	But for your Uncle Sancho ees, ees...
Sancho
	I know ees loco, but for me, being een Coburg ees eso hard. My heart, ees breaking, you know?
Tuppence
	I understand that you're rather pally with the royal family here, %a000090.
Tuppence
	A moat and drawbridge... That makes the castle fairly impenetrable. What a good idea!
Bianca
	Looks like Coburg's bin pretty peaceful ever since that kerfuffle all them years ago. That must be a relief to you, eh?
Nera
	Prince Harry and King Wilbur seem to be doing an excellent job here. The place has a very warm feel to it now.
%0%a001240
	He'll get a cold, sleeping there like that!
%0%a001250
	Yuck! That man smells of drink!
Tuppence
	I'd say it's fairly likely that character's been
	thrown out of his house for snoring too loudly, wouldn't you?
%0%a001250
	It must be horrible to lose something important to you like that. The poor man!
Sancho
	You esee? Ees no esafe here.
	Ees the work of the thieves.
Debora
	Don't you have some friends who live in Coburg?
Debora
	You should go and see them while we're here.
Debora
	Prince Kendrick? If he's a prince, then surely that means he must be your friend Harry's son?
Debora
	Huh! He may be quick on his feet, but that's about the only thing he's got going for him.
Debora
	It's bad news if she can sense it even here.
	We need to hurry.
Debora
	It's good that our children are quiet and well-behaved like me.
Debora
	How pathetic! A man like him shouldn't have a phobia about mice!
Debora
	You don't think that there'll ever be a power struggle between our two children, do you?
Debora
	%0%a001240 and %a001250 don't have many friends their own age, do they?
Debora
	It might be good for them to make a servⓚⓛ
	Er, I mean, to make a friend out of Kendrick.
Debora
	Harry seems to have acquired a certain air of dignity.
Debora
	Maybe there's hope for you yet.
Debora
	Children can be quite devious when they want to be. I've no clue where they've got to.
Debora
	Do you have any idea where they might be?
Debora
	Then hurry up and see if you're right!
Debora
	No? Hmph. You're no use. I suppose we'll just have to search the whole castle until we find them.
Debora
	It could be quite interesting if someone like that were in power.
Debora
	I wouldn't want our children to turn out that
	way, though.

	You'll bring peace to the world, no problem!
	You don't seem a likely sort, but you have me with you, so you're sure to succeed.
Debora
	I'm going to hold onto your hand all the time to make sure you don't go missing again.
Debora
	...You're not taking me seriously, are you?
	It was just a joke!

Debora

Debora
	Hmm... From what you've told me, I'd say our friend Harry here is in denial!
Debora
	Looks like you can't get inside the castle at night.
	I suppose it's good for security and all, but it could be a bit irritating in an emergency.
