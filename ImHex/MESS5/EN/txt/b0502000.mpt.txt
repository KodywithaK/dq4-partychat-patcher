Harry
	That trader must've been talking about the book that mentions the mysterious mirror. It certainly is a curiosity, that's for sure.
Harry
	She's not the only one who got out while she could. This place feels like it's half empty nowadays.
Harry
	That must be a teleportal. They're curious things that allow you to travel quickly between two far away places.
Harry
	It reminds me of something I read once in an old book about travelling through a teleportal from the castle to another land.
Harry
	Sorry! Listen to me waffling away!
Maria
	I had no idea such a place existed so close to
	the abbey.
Harry
	We should get going now that we have Ra's mirror.
Harry
	The people of Coburg mustn't be left to suffer a moment longer!
Maria
	Fancy being able to travel all the way to Coburg in an instant!
Maria
	This teleportal is so convenient...and so bizarre! Maybe it's the work of the Goddess. 
Harry
	If he won't let us pass, then I suppose there's nothing we can do. Let's move on, %a000090!
Harry
	So we're not allowed to pass at night. Oh well. We'll have to come back another time.
Maria
	That old man must be a bit lonely, stuck out here all on his own.
Maria
	If only he'd drop in at the abbey, there'd be plenty of people there he could have a chat with.
Harry
	It's nice to have a place where we're made to feel so welcome, don't you think, %a000090?
Harry
	Sorry, %a000090. We're supposed to be looking for your mother, and yet I've gone and distracted you with this instead.
Harry
	I never imagined we'd end up going to the tower with Maria.
Harry
	I suppose nuns are basically the same as monks really. Maybe we should ask them about the tower.
Maria
	I suppose that's my part in this done with. But I'd like to stay with you until you find what you came for, if that's alright.
Harry
	Of course. You've been a great help to us, Maria. We'd be honoured to have you. Right, %a000090?
Harry
	It's hard to imagine either of us as good husbands when you think we were both slaves until just recently!
Harry
	But we know what it feels like to be miserable because of someone else's violence, so at least we'll never be like her brute of a husband.
Maria
	I think she's right. You would make a good husband, %a000090.
Maria
	...Oh! And so would you, Harry! I didn't mean to leave you out.
Harry
	I say! There's no need to make a special effort to compliment me, you know!
Maria
	I had a small statue of the Goddess carved for me a little while back.
Maria
	It made me feel so at peace to hold it in my hands and see Her smiling at me.
Maria
	I'm rather good at cooking and sewing myself, because I had to do it for Joshua and I from a young age.
Harry
	I wonder why Maria seems so lonely.
	Maybe it's because I'm not around.
Harry
	Er, no, I'm sure that's not it.
	If only it was, though...
Harry
	The girl's right. We mustn't let Maria come to any harm, do you hear, %a000090?
Maria
	That little girl really seems to think of me as her big sister.
Maria
	It's nice to have a little sister out of nowhere.
	I only ever had a brother before.
Harry
	It's wonderful to see Maria again. I do feel a bit jealous that she said your name before mine, though.
Harry
	I suppose nuns are basically the same as monks really. Maybe we should ask them about the tower.
Harry
	It's lovely to have you travelling with us again, Maria.
Maria
	Thank you, Harry. I'm really happy to be with you again too.
Maria
	You do both seem a little bit different to before, though.
Maria
	It's almost like you have a shadow cast over you.
Harry
	I'm going to stand by you, Maria! I'll protect you with my life, now and forever!
Maria
	Sorry? What was that you just said, Harry?
Harry
	Er... Ha, ha. Don't worry. It was nothing important.
Harry
	Well, we have Maria with us now, so I suppose we should get along to that tower.
Maria
	I wonder what the Abbess meant by ⓗthose who are too proud to believe in things they cannot seeⓘ.
Maria
	I know I volunteered myself for this, but I'm starting to worry that I might not be worthy.
Harry
	As long as I have a bed to sleep in, I'm happy. We've got another long day ahead of us, %a000090!
Harry
	I feel much better after that rest.
	Thanks, %a000090.
Harry
	To tell you the truth, I'm still not quite used to sleeping in a bed again. I suppose it's because I was a slave for such a long time.
Harry
	You don't need to worry about me, %a000090. Let's move on.
Maria
	I wonder what sort of man she had in mind, that girl who went through all the domestic goddess training.
Maria
	The poor child definitely feels lonely at times.
Maria
	She may seem strong on the outside, but she must miss her father terribly.
Harry
	It's wonderful to see Maria again. I do feel a bit jealous that she said your name before mine, though.
Harry
	I suppose nuns are basically the same as monks really. Maybe we should ask them about the tower.
Harry
	It's lovely to have you travelling with us again, Maria.
Maria
	Thank you, Harry. I'm really happy to be with you again too.
Maria
	You do both seem a little bit different to before, though.
Maria
	It's almost like you have a shadow cast over you.
Harry
	I'm going to stand by you, Maria! I'll protect you with my life, now and forever!
Maria
	Sorry? What was that you just said, Harry?
Harry
	Er... Ha, ha. Don't worry. It was nothing important.
Harry
	Well, we have Maria with us now, so I suppose we should get along to that tower.
Maria
	I wonder what the Abbess meant by ⓗthose who are too proud to believe in things they cannot seeⓘ.
Maria
	I know I volunteered myself for this, but I'm starting to worry that I might not be worthy.
Harry
	As long as I have a bed to sleep in, I'm happy. We've got another long day ahead of us, %a000090!
Harry
	I feel much better after that rest.
	Thanks, %a000090.
Harry
	To tell you the truth, I'm still not quite used to sleeping in a bed again. I suppose it's because I was a slave for such a long time.
Harry
	You don't need to worry about me, %a000090. Let's move on.
Harry
	It's finally time for Coburg to come out of the clouds and back into the sunshine! Let's go and find Wilbur!
Maria
	It's funny to think that Harry is actually a prince of such an enormous castle.
Maria
	In the normal run of things, there's no way someone as lowly as I would ever have had the chance to befriend him.
Harry
	The place looks so different. But it all ends here! All we have to do is oust that fake dowager!
Harry
	There's nothing anyone can do to stop us now!
	Let's go, %a000090!
Harry
	There were plenty of times when we went without food for three days back when we were slaves, eh, %a000090?
Maria
	I heard a few nasty rumours about Coburg back at the abbey, but I had no idea things were this bad.
Harry
	That was a bit mean, %a000090. Surely you could afford to give her a few coins?
Maria
	If I had any money, I'd give as much as I could to these poor folk here.
Harry
	............
~ Harry is biting his lip in thought. ~
Maria
	Goddess, please have mercy on these poor suffering souls.
Harry
	I cried with hunger in those first awful days of becoming a slave. There's nothing worse than being without food.
Maria
	That poor boy. He looks so weak and thin...
Harry
	A monster in the castle courtyard of all places! I thought it was a dog, and it took me totally off-guard!
Maria
	Are you alright?
Maria
	There's no need to worry about me. Luckily, you were there to protect me.
Harry
	It won't be long before this dark period comes to an end.
Harry
	The light of truth that shines forth from this mirror will be all that Coburg needs to banish the darkness!
Maria
	It's time to help those poor, suffering people at last.
Harry
	A castle fell from the sky!? I didn't even know there was a castle up there in the first place. It's all a bit odd if you ask me.
Maria
	I've heard something like that before myself.
Maria
	Maybe the Goddess did it. Maybe she made the castle fall and the monsters attack humans again as a way of testing us.
Harry
	Curses! We don't have time for this!
	We'll have to find another way.
Harry
	Hey! Now's not the time for detours!
	Stay focused!
Harry
	Urgh! The thought of someone like that ruling over Coburg...and the world!
Maria
	If there's a war, lots of people will end up losing their lives. We have to stop it from coming to that!
Harry
	They won't be looking so pleased with themselves when I'm finished here!
Harry
	So the fake dowager is actually a monster?
	How did a monster get in here unnoticed?
Harry
	He's right about those soldiers being an unsavoury-looking bunch.
Harry
	I was starting to worry that all the soldiers here had gone mad. It's nice to see one with his head still screwed on.
Harry
	The fake dowager must have already been in place at the time Whealbrook was attacked.
Harry
	There's no way a human would order an innocent village to be destroyed like that.
Harry
	Darwin? I don't remember hearing that name before. I wonder if the fake dowager summoned him here.
Harry
	Maybe the fake dowager was trying to research a way of evolving into a stronger being.
Maria
	A secret unlocking the mysteries of evolution? It all sounds a bit scary for my liking.
Maria
	I'd say it's more likely to be the hand of evil than the hand of the Goddess.
Harry
	This passage was made so that it could be used as a means of escape in case of some kind of emergency.
Harry
	I never imagined I'd be using it to sneak inside my own castle! Of all the ironies!
Harry
	I doubt there's much use in explaining that it was all the fake dowager's doing.
Harry
	We just have to reveal her true identity and put an end to all this. Then we can rescue the old man.
Maria
	That poor man, being stuck down here in the dark all those years.
Maria
	What a terrible place to die...
Maria
	May all these poor souls find their way from these dark depths to the eternal comfort of the Goddess on high!
Harry
	When they talk about having someone's head on a platter around here, they probably mean it literally!
Harry
	That's because the fake dowager came along. It stands to reason that she's going to change because she's a different person entirely!
Harry
	It sounds like Wilbur's been down to the jail and freed the real dowager.
Harry
	Let's go and find Wilbur. Hurry, %a000090!
Harry
	Huh! If only he hadn't gone and meddled in all this.
Harry
	He always was a bit slow-witted.
Maria
	Oh dear. What a pickle! At least we have the mirror to help us figure all this out.
Harry
	He realises this is silly. I just wish he was a bit more together. He is King, after all.
Maria
	So that's Harry's brother, King of Coburg?
	They're not very alike.
Harry
	Hmm. I'm not so sure she's the real thing.
	Look at how grubby she is!
Harry
	The Queen Dowager I knew was nowhere near as gentle and warm, either.
Maria
	We should use the mirror!
Harry
	Ah yes. I remember that shrill voice well from my childhood years. Maybe this is the real one.
Maria
	We should use the mirror!
Harry
	Now's not the time to keep quiet and lay low! We'll show that monster who's boss this time, %a000090!
Harry
	This must've all been a big shock for Wilbur.
	The kingdom was on the brink of disaster.
Harry
	Come on, %a000090!
	I need your help!
Harry
	It's finally time for Coburg to come out of the clouds and back into the sunshine! Let's go and find Wilbur!
Maria
	It's funny to think that Harry is actually a prince of such an enormous castle.
Maria
	In the normal run of things, there's no way someone as lowly as I would ever have had the chance to befriend him.
Harry
	This place feels even more desolate at night.
	It's like walking through a graveyard.
Maria
	The entrance to the castle is closed at night.
	We should come back in the morning.
Harry
	All the people here need is a little more patience.
	We'll sort things out for them before long.
Maria
	Shouldn't the rulers of a kingdom be there to make their people happy? That's what I always thought.
Harry
	I didn't realise that my father was trying to pass the crown on to me before he died.
Harry
	I do remember there being a strained atmosphere in the castle at the time. I suppose that was why.
Maria
	If only you'd become king, Harry. Then none of this would have happened.
Harry
	That trader must've been talking about the book that mentions the mysterious mirror. It certainly is a curiosity, that's for sure.
Harry
	She's not the only one who got out while she could. This place feels like it's half empty nowadays.
Harry
	This is where your father was killed by that no-good Ladja.
Harry
	I'll never forget the way he put up no resistance and endured all that to keep you safe.
Harry
	It feels just like yesterday that you came here and tried to rescue me.
Harry
	Who would have thought then that we'd end up being friends all this time?
Harry
	I wonder if he's talking about the temple when he mentions a holy land. Pah! That place is more like hell!
Harry
	It looks like the bandits aren't using this place as a hideout any more.
Harry
	You don't think these are the kidnappers, do you?
	What in the world happened here?
Harry
	It's been many a long year since we had the chance to enjoy so much outside air.
Harry
	It's funny. I used to take little things like that for granted, but now they seem so important.
Harry
	It's all very well deciding to go off and find your mother, but where do we start?
Harry
	I suppose that town to the north is as good a place as any.
Harry
	I still can't believe how we managed to travel so far in a barrel, of all things!
Harry
	We must be the luckiest people alive!
Harry
	That Fortuna place was certainly lively,
	wasn't it?
Harry
	Can you imagine if Coburg or your village were that well off? Wow!
Harry
	Ha ha! I was a bit worried the price might reflect the quality, but this isn't a bad horse and cart!
Harry
	Now we can bring as many people as we like along on our travels.
Harry
	The Coburg checkpoint never used to be so imposing.
Harry
	It's so awful what happened to your village, %a000090. I...I...don't know what to say.
Harry
	It sounds like Coburg has changed beyond recognition since I've been away.
Harry
	I have to get to the bottom of what's going on. Let's go to the castle!
Harry
	I had planned to forget any ties I ever had to Coburg. But it looks like it's not going to be that easy.
Maria
	Off we go. The tower is just south of the abbey.
Harry
	We must have some special connection with Maria. That's why we've found ourselves travelling with her again.
Harry
	As long as we make sure she doesn't come to any harm. That's the main thing.
Harry
	I'm obviously worried about what's happening over in Coburg, but I think it's for the best if I stay away.
Harry
	I'm just going to forget about the place. I'll keep travelling with you until I figure out my own way in the world.
Harry
	Lovely weather we've been having, don't you think? The grass smells wonderful.
Harry
	There's nothing better than being free to walk around outdoors whenever the fancy takes you.
Harry
	Come to think of it, I hardly ever set foot outside Coburg Castle back in those days.
	What a waste!
Harry
	Aaah, I'm absolutely exhausted! One good thing I can say for being a slave was that we at least had a regular routine!
Harry
	You know, I think this might be the first time in my life that I've ever been out walking at night-time!
Harry
	The stars are absolutely beautiful. We never had the chance to really look at them back when we were slaves.
Harry
	It's getting dark already. But we have to keep pushing on. Come on, %a000090!
Harry
	My father didn't have much time left when it all happened.
Harry
	I wish I could meet him again, just once. I suppose there's no use in wishing, though.
Harry
	I wonder if this mirror that reveals the truth is even still hidden in the tower. That diary was really ancient, let's face it.
Harry
	The folk inside were certainly a weird bunch.
Harry
	But it was still nice to be back in the castle again. I sort of miss the place. It was once my home, after all.
Maria
	I do hope I'll be able to help you out, %a000090.
Harry
	I wonder if it really does have the powers we think it has. It looks just like an old mirror from where I'm standing.
Harry
	We'd better hurry on back to Coburg. It's starting to give me the willies being out here.
Maria
	I'm so glad I could come along with you both, %a000090. It's cheered me up no end.
Harry
	There's no point just standing here if the doors won't open. Let's try going somewhere else, %a000090.
Harry
	Hmph. Looks like the key from Coburg isn't any use here.
Harry
	It said something in that diary about some monks having the key. I wonder where we can find them.
Maria
	I'm so happy that I could be of use to you.
	What a relief!
Harry
	I knew Maria would be able to get those doors open! I always believed in her!
Harry
	Let's go and get it! But we should tread carefully. We have Maria to think of, after all.
Harry
	What are we waiting for? There's no point in hanging around here any longer, let's hurry back to Coburg!
Harry
	Did you see that, %a000090?
Harry
	Me too. I wouldn't forget that man in a hurry. Does that mean the woman was...?
Harry
	No? Oh... I must have been imagining things.
Harry
	This tower looks really ancient. I had no idea it was here, in amongst all these mountains.
Harry
	This must be the tower we read about in that diary! So this is where the mirror's supposed
	to be.
Maria
	............
~ Maria looks a bit nervous. ~
Harry
	It's old, but it's certainly stood up well over the years. Maybe it's been protected by the Goddess.
Maria
	I can sense a kind of divine presence. Maybe it's true that this place was created by the Goddess.
Harry
	There must be a way ahead that we've overlooked. We must explore all possibilities.
Maria
	That's rather a big drop, isn't it?
	Take care not to fall!
Harry
	Aren't you getting tired, Maria?
	Maybe we should rest for a while.
Maria
	No, not at all. I don't want to slow you down.
Harry
	This tower's starting to get on my nerves!
	We don't have time for this kind of thing!
Harry
	Oh blast! How are we supposed to go any further with the path gone like this!?
Maria
	The idea behind this place is that only those who believe in things they can't always see receive the blessing of the Goddess.
Maria
	So maybe this is a kind of test. To see if we'll doubt what's actually before our very eyes.
Harry
	We found it! With this mirror, we'll be able to save Coburg from the chaos it's fallen into!
Maria
	We managed to pass the trial of the tower!
	Dear Goddess, we are eternally grateful!
Harry
	I didn't expect there to be a path right in front of me that I couldn't see.
Harry
	Now I'm starting to think there might be some truth in this talk of the tower being created by the Goddess.
Maria
	It was frightening, but we've proved now that you just need the courage to move forward one step at a time, and a path will open up to you.
Maria
	I'm going to learn from this, and try to live my life with courage from now on in!
Harry
	Well, we have what we came for. We should hurry on back to Coburg and put this little episode behind us.
Harry
	Sorry I put you and Maria to so much trouble, %a000090.
Harry
	We're not quite there yet, though. I'll save my thanks for when this is all done and dusted.
Bianca
	It's great to be able to have a little adventure together again after all these years, %a000090!
Bianca
	You've grown up an awful lot since last
	time. Just imagine what kind of fun we 
	could have now!
Bianca
	Dun't take any notice of what Dad was sayin'.
	He's ill. He dun't know what he's on about!
Bianca
	That bloke's veggies taste amazin'. We have him deliver 'em to our place, and they're great!
Bianca
	That bloke may moan, but what his son's doin' is probably a big help.
Bianca
	It's up to us folk of Stockenbarrel to man the lock and keep it maintained.
Bianca
	I dun't think there's many folk who've had
	it opened for 'em and bin up to that lake
	he was on about.
Bianca
	That cat's not exactly a pet of ours, but it seems to like hangin' around our place all the time.
Bianca
	Come to think of it, I wonder how %a001210's gettin' along.
Bianca
	I'm sure he means well deep down, but I wish he wouldn't call me ⓗdarlin'ⓘ.
Bianca
	Just because it's a mixed bath, it dun't mean people shouldn't observe some kind of limits!
Bianca
	What d'you reckon, %a000090?
	D'you think my skin's lovely?
Bianca
	Ha ha! Thanks! I reckon it's all down to havin' one of these baths every day for the last Goddess knows how long.
Bianca
	Fair enough. I am a bit sunburnt, after all. And then there's all the cuts and grazes. Not to mention the odd bruise or two...
Bianca
	Huh! Look who's all grown up all of a sudden!
Bianca
	We moved here to Stockenbarrel because we thought the bath water might do Dad some good.
Bianca
	In an ideal world, I'd have preferred to stay in Roundbeck so I'd know sooner when you were back safe and sound.
Bianca
	Ha ha! She certainly tells it like it is!
Bianca
	I really liked it back in Roundbeck, but this place en't bad neither. Can be a bit quiet, mind.
Bianca
	Oh yeah. I remember one of the villagers headin' off to join up with that religion a while back.
	I wonder how they're gettin' on.
Bianca
	It's a bit of a pain havin' to traipse past the inn to get to the baths.
Bianca
	But they're the ones takin' care of them, so I s'pose it's fair enough.
Bianca
	I dun't think I've bin this happy in a long time. You're back on the scene and Dad seems to be gettin' better. It's all good!
Bianca
	There's somethin' about goin' into a pub durin' the day. It always seems quieter than everywhere else, dun't you think?
Bianca
	The White King's Paradise? That sounds a bit serious. This kind of talk really gives me the willies for some reason.
Bianca
	That scintillating sinter he was on about is the crystal deposits left behind in the bath water. It's all natural stuff, and there's not a lot of it.
Bianca
	It's the most famous thing about Stockenbarrel by far.
Bianca
	I had intended to take care of everythin' myself, but that bloke said carpenteerin' is too dangerous for me alone.
Bianca
	So we came to an arrangement where he'd
	come and help me out each day. He's a 
	bit of a worrier, mind!
Bianca
	It's up to us folk of Stockenbarrel to man the lock and keep it maintained.
Bianca
	I dun't think there's many folk who've had
	it opened for 'em and bin up to that lake
	he was on about.
Bianca
	If only he wasn't here, we'd have the whole
	bath to ourselves, eh? Ha ha! Don't worry,
	I'm only jokin'!
Bianca
	A cave... I wonder if that's where your ring's hidden, %a000090.
Bianca
	There certainly was a treasure in there, eh!
	The key to your happiness, no less!
Bianca
	Ha ha! There you go again, tryin' to speak to folk when they're sleepin'! You're a funny one sometimes, %a000090.
Bianca
	That woman always stays up into the night until her old man comes home.
Bianca
	She makes all this fuss and moans about him
	bein' late, but I think she's just anxious
	when he's not around.
Bianca
	There en't any other girls of my age here in the village. I hope this one hangs around for a while.
Bianca
	It's bin a while since any young folk came here to visit the baths. It's mostly old people comin' to fix their ailments.
Bianca
	Oh yeah. I remember one of the villagers headin' off to join up with that religion a while back. I hope they're okay.
Bianca
	That old man's always comin' out with things a bit over the line. But I'm sure he means well
	deep down.
Bianca
	You've seen my house, right? That bloke had it up in no time!
Bianca
	Suddenly carpenterin' is more fun than
	it sounds!
Bianca
	You can hardly blame his missus for bein' angry. He'll be no good to anyone after ten glasses!
Bianca
	That little one's always asleep here of a night. I wonder what it is about our house that it likes so much.
Bianca
	I can't believe it's bin over ten years.
	An awful lot's happened to both of us since then, eh, %a000090?
Bianca
	What an enormous cave! And it's not even all that dark either, what with the light comin' in through the gaps in the rocks.
Bianca
	Quite a difference to our little adventure at Uptaten Towers, eh? That was a dark old smelly old place if ever there was one!
Bianca
	It's quite a puzzle really, this place. I mean, the fact that it has paths and stairs probably means the whole thing's man-made.
Bianca
	You've grown up to be pretty strong, %a000090. I must admit, I'm a bit surprised!
Bianca
	You dun't seem to want to talk about it much, but I can tell you've bin through an awful lot since we last met.
Bianca
	I can hear a really loud noise comin' from somewhere. Like a roar or somethin'.
	I wonder what it is.
Bianca
	I never expected Mum to die so early.
Bianca
	Life's pretty unpredictable, en't it, %a000090? You never can tell what's 'round the corner.
Bianca
	Well, we can't stand here admirin' the scenery all day long. Let's just make sure we don't fall though, eh?
Bianca
	............
~ Bianca looks a bit annoyed. ~
Bianca
	There's no way I'm goin' to let a lowlife like him find the ring! We'd better hurry up and
	get ahead!
Bianca
	It feels like we've bin climbin' down for ages now. Surely it can't be much further!?
Bianca
	There must be another place like this we've overlooked.
Bianca
	We've looked all over the place, but I suppose we must've missed somethin' along the way.
Bianca
	We'd better try lookin' again a bit more carefully this time.
Bianca
	I suppose you'll become a ⓗMostroferratianⓘ or whatever once you get married, eh, %a000090?
Bianca
	There was a chance we might've come to live here once, y'know.
Bianca
	It's not far from the baths of Stockenbarrel, and it's great for shoppin'.
Bianca
	But it was decided we'd move to Stockenbarrel itself in the end, 'cos it's better for Dad and his health if he's somewhere quiet.
Bianca
	I hope it really is the Zenithian Shield.
	It would be great if you could find your Mum.
Bianca
	Crispin's the one who fancies Nera, right?
Bianca
	Sounds like he pushed himself a bit too far 'cos he wants to marry her so badly. Poor thing.
Bianca
	He's a canny salesman, eh? He's right, though.
	We should check over our stuff before we go anywhere.
Bianca
	Hey, it must be makin' you a bit jealous, the idea of Nera lookin' after some other bloke!
Bianca
	Ha ha ha! Thought so.
Bianca
	Pah! You dun't have to lie to me, y'know!
Bianca
	Yeah, you're bound to find the ring no problem.
	I'm here to help you, after all!
Bianca
	What d'you suppose that means? Do you think Nera loves someone else?
Bianca
	Or maybe she just dun't want you to get hurt.
	Hm, I wonder what it is that's on her mind.
Bianca
	Crispin and Nera are childhood friends, en't they?
Bianca
	I suppose it's only natural she'd be worried about him gettin' hurt, then.
Bianca
	It's hardly Nera's fault. It's her dad who's to blame for comin' up with such a dangerous challenge in the first place.
Bianca
	Nera's so pretty. And she seems really sweet too.
Bianca
	I'd say she might even be a bit too good for you, %a000090!
Bianca
	Crikey! What awful burns! I reckon his fever'll be around for a while, judgin' by the look of him.
Bianca
	Blimey! That was a bit of a shock! How can she be so polite to her customers in one breath and so rotten to her husband the next!?
Bianca
	It's hard to tell whether he's just kind or weak-willed. They certainly go well together, anyway.
Bianca
	I hope I manage to find someone like that to marry one day. It's a long way off yet, though, I'm sure.
Bianca
	The church here is so huge and beautiful!
Bianca
	It really is lovely. I hope I can get married in a place like that.
Bianca
	That Briscoletti bloke must be loaded to have
	a holiday home within spittin' distance of his
	actual house!
Bianca
	Wow! What a house! I can't believe you're goin' to be part of such a rich family, %a000090!
Bianca
	That Briscoletti certainly dun't mince his words, eh?
Bianca
	I wonder if he really thinks you'd
	do somethin' like that...
Bianca
	Dun't tell anyone, but he was a right wimp! He was cryin' and moanin' about the pain, so it was ever so hard tryin' to tend to him.
Bianca
	You're plannin' on carryin' on with your travels after you get married, right, %a000090?
Bianca
	I suppose Nera will be pretty
	worried about you, then.
Bianca
	Eh!? So you're goin' after the ring just so you can marry Nera? And not because you want the Zenithian Shield!?
Bianca
	Well... Yeah, I suppose I can see your point. Maybe it's best just to give up lookin' for your mum and settle down to a family of your own.
Bianca
	What d'you suppose that means? Do you think Nera loves someone else?
Bianca
	Or maybe she just dun't want you to get hurt.
	Hm, I wonder what it is that's on her mind.
Bianca
	Fancy thinkin' of gettin' married just for the money! It's like Nera's some kind of meal ticket to him.
Bianca
	I dun't think this is a good idea, %a000090.
	That stuff's ever so strong. It en't for them who
	en't used to it.
Bianca
	Are you okay, %a000090? Drinkin' all that probably weren't the best idea. Let me know if you start to feel funny.
Bianca
	Looks like that's his tactic with the ladies. At least you dun't have to resort to things like that, %a000090.
Bianca
	Crispin and Nera are childhood friends, en't they?
Bianca
	I suppose it's only natural she'd be worried about him gettin' hurt, then.
Bianca
	Crispin really loves Nera, eh?
Bianca
	It seems like it should be the two of them gettin' married, really.
Bianca
	Sorry! Just forget I said anythin'.
Bianca
	Ha ha ha! It's funny seein' how different folk are with their spouses!
Bianca
	Nera will be asleep by now. I know you want to see her, but you'll just have to wait until tomorrow.
Bianca
	So this is Nera's older sister, is it?
Bianca
	Blimey! I dun't think you could find two folk more different to each other.
Bianca
	I suppose I have bin livin' in the countryside a while, so I can see why I'd look like a peasant to the likes of her.
Bianca
	But there's no need for her to come right out and say it to my face!
Bianca
	I dun't suppose you actually prefer that Debora over Nera, do you, %a000090?
Bianca
	Well, I'll be! Who'd have seen that comin', eh?
Bianca
	Yeah, I suppose you prefer the more ladylike type, eh?
Bianca
	I dun't suppose you actually prefer that Debora over Nera, do you, %a000090?
Bianca
	Well, I'll be! Who'd have seen that comin', eh?
Bianca
	Yeah, I suppose you prefer the more ladylike type, eh?
Bianca
	So this is it, %a000090. With the Circle of Water, nothin's stoppin' you from marryin' that Nera.
Bianca
	Make sure you invite me to the weddin', eh? I did help you find the ring, after all, so you owe me one!
Bianca
	There was a chance we might've come to live here once, y'know.
Bianca
	It's not far from the baths of Stockenbarrel, and it's great for shoppin'.
Bianca
	But it was decided we'd move to Stockenbarrel itself in the end, 'cos it's better for Dad and his health if he's somewhere quiet.
Bianca
	Um, %a000090. Do you really love Nera?
Bianca
	Ha ha ha! Yeah, of course you do. Sorry.
	That was a weird thing of me to ask.
Bianca
	Hmm. Nera would be really sad if she heard you sayin' that, you know.
Bianca
	I bet that veil's well nice! Nera's so lucky...
Bianca
	Crispin's the one who fancies Nera, right?
Bianca
	Sounds like he pushed himself a bit too far 'cos he wants to marry her so badly. Poor thing.
Bianca
	That Briscoletti's jumpin' the gun a bit, eh? You din't even tell him you found the ring or nothin'.
Bianca
	I suppose that means he must believe in you a fair bit, eh, %a000090?
Bianca
	What d'you suppose that means? Do you think Nera loves someone else?
Bianca
	Or maybe she just dun't want you to get hurt.
	Hm, I wonder what it is that's on her mind.
Bianca
	I dun't think it's just booze they have on sale here. They have some funny other drinks too.
Bianca
	Crispin and Nera are childhood friends, en't they?
Bianca
	I suppose it's only natural she'd be worried about him gettin' hurt, then.
Bianca
	If she's goin' to such lengths to take care of him, maybe Nera... Never mind.
Bianca
	Looks like the burns en't the only thing causin' Crispin some pain, eh?
Bianca
	Blimey! That was a bit of a shock! How can she be so polite to her customers in one breath and so rotten to her husband the next!?
Bianca
	Fair enough, I s'pose. It's quite nice when a wife makes her husband dinner every now and then too, though, eh?
Bianca
	I hope I manage to find someone like that to marry one day. It's a long way off yet, though, I'm sure.
Bianca
	I wonder if he would've really bin allowed to marry Nera if he'd have found the ring.
Bianca
	It dun't bear thinkin' about! Lucky for her it din't turn out that way, anyhow.
Bianca
	The church here is so huge and beautiful!
Bianca
	It really is lovely. I hope I can get married in a place like that.
Bianca
	That Briscoletti bloke must be loaded to have
	a holiday home within spittin' distance of his
	actual house!
Bianca
	I'm startin' to get all nervous now!
	Come on, %a000090. Let's go.
Bianca
	That was a bit stupid of us, bowlin' on back here without the Circle of Water!
