	Whoever would have thought there'd be a museum in a place like this?
*: 
	Mind you, it feels a bit creepy, don't you think?
*: 
	I just stumbled upon this place while I was on my travels, you know.
*: 
	It's a very grand building, isn't it? If they
	just had some things on display, this place
	would be sensational!
*: 
	'E's a proper fine buildin' 'e is, en't 'e?
*: 
	The place doesn't feel so creepy now there are actually a few exhibits on display, don't you think?
*: 
	Well, I wasn't expecting this. There are plenty of things on display, but they're all exactly the same!
*: 
	You can start to imagine what people's lives in different places are like when you look at these exhibits, can't you? It's really quite fascinating.
*: 
	Apparently all these articles were collected by
	the curator himself. Personally! He must be quite
	a man, eh?
*: 
	The rarer the exhibits in a museum, the more visitors it attracts. Ⓠ La-la, la-lah! And I say to myself, what a won-der-ful knackatoriiie! Ⓡ
*: 
	'E's a proper fine buildin' 'e is, en't 'e?
*: 
	Tee hee hee!
	A museum in the middle of the forest.
	This is fun!

*: 
	It's rather chic, this place, isn't it?
	Most unusual for a museum.
*: 
	Apparently all these articles were collected by
	the curator himself. Personally! He must be quite
	a man, eh?
*: 
	Hmm... Yes...
	Most interesting...
*: 
	Such exquisite decor needs to be set off with a truly stunning exhibit, don't you think?
*: 
	I don't much like goin' in posh places like what
	this is. Makes me feel all nervous.
*: 
	Tee hee hee!
	A museum in the middle of the forest.
	This is fun!
*: 
	Can you believe it!? This is where he brings me on our honeymoon!
*: 
	These are dangerous times to go travelling.
*: 
	I thought if we came here to see the souvenirs from all over the world, it might feel a bit like a grand tour! Do you think the wife's impressed?
*:

*: 
	See that exhibit there? I made that meself, y'know. Pretty impressive, eh?
*: 
	'Ang on... Where'd it go?
*: 
	That man says he made everything in here.
	I don't know... Do you think he's telling the truth?
*: 
	Apparently all these articles were collected by
	the curator himself. Personally! He must be quite
	a man, eh?
*: 
	Where's my little boy got to now?
*: 
	I suppose he got bored of looking at all these displays and wandered off somewhere.
*: 
	Hmm... Yes...
	Most interesting...
*: 
	I've been retired for many a long year now, but it's a comfort to know the work of us craftsmen will be preserved for the young ones to see.
*: 
	The articles on display here are simply fascinating. I can't stay away!
*: 
	I was trainin' to be a craftsman myself,
	but I threw in the towel a while back.
*: 
	But comin' here and seein' how hard some folk work at stuff, I've decided to give it another bash!
*: 
	Upstairs is so packed with people, I can't relax.
*: 
	It's far better down here. And the articles they keep hidden away aren't bad, either!
*: 
	The way these exhibits have been arranged...
	It's inspired!
*: 
	You get a real sense of conflict between the different pieces, don't you?
*: 
	I heard a rumour that %O0960%Xyou%Y%a000090%Z had been appointed curator of this museum, so I came hither to witness it for myself.
*: 
	What a thoughtful collection of rare items!
*: 
	I don't much like goin' in posh places like what
	this is. Makes me feel all nervous.
*: 
	Tee hee hee!
	A museum in the middle of the forest.
	This is fun!
*: 
	Can you believe it!? This is where he brings me on our honeymoon!
*: 
	I'm sure all these pieces of junk are just wonderful, but where's the beach? And what
	about the candle-lit dinners, hm?
*: 
	Looks like my wife's really enjoying the place, eh?
*: 
	I knew this would be a great place for a honeymoon. I can't think of a better start to
	our life together!
*: 
	This really is a fine collection of articles from all walks of life. A tribute to man's potential, don't you think?
*: 
	Wow! The place is bustling, isn't it?
	Everyone seems to love it.
*: 
	You can start to imagine what people's lives in different places are like when you look at these exhibits, can't you? It's really quite fascinating.
*: 
	My, what a lot of pretty little knick-knacks!
	It makes you realise what a world we live in.
*: 
	Maybe I'll get one o' my prize dishes on display in 'ere if I get famous enough. Wot's that? I'll 'ave to master ⓗoat cuisineⓘ and ⓗcord on blueⓘ first?
*: 
	When I grow up, I'm going to make something too. Can I put it on display here?
*: 
	Cool! I'm going to be famous!
*: 
	Oh, why not? That's not fair!
*: 
	These knick-knacks are all so pretty, aren't they?
*: 
	I never expected to happen across such a marvellous place on an earthly journey.
	The Goddess works in mysterious ways.
*: 
	For a civilisation to create such finely-crafted, beautiful works of art...
	Hmm. Interesting, most interesting.
*: 
	I've been retired for many a long year now, but it's a comfort to know the work of us craftsmen will be preserved for the young ones to see.
*: 
	I really can't decide which artefact I should purchase for my little precious back home.
	Maybe I'll just buy the lot!
*: 
	Look at all these beautiful items! I feel a poem coming on... There once was a curator called %a000090...
*: 
	Good, good! I'm glad to see my country's been properly represented.
*: 
	With our speciality on display here, we should see a few more tourists visiting!
*: 
	I wish someone would give me a pretty little
	trinket sometime.
*: 
	'E's a proper posh place this, but them things on display is all right funny stuff.
*: 
	Tee hee hee!
	A museum in the middle of the forest.
	This is fun!
*: 
	It's not even a proper museum, you know! I mean, look at all these weird exhibits. This is the worst honeymoon I've ever had!
*: 
	Nothing makes me happier than seeing my new wife with a smile on her face!
*: 
	I knew this would be a great place for a honeymoon. I can't think of a better start to
	our life together!
*: 
	Everything in here looks pretty weird if you ask me. What's that about, eh?
*: 
	I mean, who'd bother going to the effort of making funny stuff like this? And how'd it get to be famous anyway, eh?
*: 
	Wow! The place is bustling, isn't it?
	Everyone seems to love it.
*: 
	You can start to imagine what people's lives in different places are like when you look at these exhibits, can't you? It's really quite fascinating.
*: 
	My, what a lot of peculiar little knick-knacks!
	It makes you realise what a world we live in.
*: 
	Never seen that one before!
*: 
	I's always thought musli-eums woz stuck-up nonsenses. But 'e's got a fair ole dollop o' normal thingjiggamies in 'ere.
*: 
	These knick-knacks are all so interesting,
	aren't they?
*: 
	A gent told me about this place as he was waiting for me to mix his dry Gigantini the other day.
*: 
	For a civilisation to create such unusual works of art... Hmm. Interesting, most interesting.
*: 
	I've been retired for many a long year now, but it's a comfort to know the work of us craftsmen will be preserved for the young ones to see.
*: 
	People don't 'alf make some funny stuff, eh?
*: 
	Look at all these odd items! I feel a poem coming on... There once was a curator called %a000090...
*: 
	Do you think I look funny coming to a museum dressed like this?
*: 
	Hmph!
*: 
	Hee hee! But I look cute too, don't I? Right?
*: 
	Hmm. This has been a bit of an eye-opener. I see now that there's room for improvement in my work. I need to hone my skills.
*: 
	I don't feel right goin' in a place as posh as this.
*: 
	Tee hee hee!
	A museum in the middle of the forest.
	This is fun!
*: 
	My husband brought me here on our honeymoon, can you believe?
*: 
	It's a bit scary, isn't it? But they say the curator fought monsters to get all these things, you know.
	He sounds like a wonderful man!
*: 
	My wife won't stop asking questions about the curator. I'm starting to wonder if she wishes she'd married him!
*: 
	Maybe this wasn't such a good choice for a honeymoon destination after all...
*: 
	Well! I wasn't expecting a museum full of sinister, ill-omened exhibits.
*: 
	But it was worth seeing. I found a certain beauty amongst all the sinisterness, if the truth be known.
*: 
	Wow! The place is bustling, isn't it?
	Everyone seems to love it.
*: 
	You can start to imagine what people's lives in different places are like when you look at these exhibits, can't you? It's really quite fascinating.
*: 
	Museums are just childish frivolity at times like these really, aren't they?
*: 
	See that exhibit there? I made that meself, y'know. Pretty impressive, eh?
*: 
	'Ang on... Where'd it go?
*: 
	You wouldn't believe how far I've come to visit this museum. Just look at my clothes. They haven't stood up to the journey very well, have they?
*: 
	These knick-knacks are all so frightening,
	aren't they?
*: 
	Wot d'ya reckon? This place is full o' dodgy characters, eh? I wouldn't like to be the boss,
	I can tell ya!
*: 
	For a civilisation to create such terrifying works of art... Hmm. Interesting, most interesting.
*: 
	I don't feel comfortable around that man over there. I'd steer clear of him if I were you. I know
	I'm going to!
*: 
	Hwa ha ha ha hah! One fine day will see the whole world overrun with such objects of terror!
*: 
	This place is a treasure trove!
	Look at this 'ere! And that!
	Heh heh! It's all good stuff!
*: 
	Hmm... I almost feel as if there's a dark
	aura emanating from these exhibits.
	No, I... I must be imagining it.
*: 
	I, I didn't expect this to be on display here!
	I d-don't know that I like it!
*: 
	Really! Wouldn't something else look better exhibited here?
*: 
	Hah hah! Amateurs often struggle a bit at the start, but a proper expert like me can instantly sort the diamonds from the crystals.
*: 
	If you need to know what anything's worth,
	I don't mind giving you a few pointers.
*: 
	Just pop whatever you're curious about up on that pedestal, and I'll go over it for you.
*: 
	You've filled the whole place up with desert roses!
*: 
	You must have a lot of time on your hands. Mind you, that's not something I'd know about. We experts are always busy, you see.
*: 
	Have you put a chocolate medalliyum on every pedestal in the museum? It smells like a sweet shop
	in here!
*: 
	Of course, they're pretty much worthless. But still, it's not a bad effort I suppose, for an amateur. Good for you.
*: 
	I see you've filled the whole place up with
	ships in bottles.
*: 
	You must enjoy making fun of your visitors, eh, displaying the same item on every pedestal!
*: 
	Well, I don't mind. I'm quite partial to a good ship in a bottle. Er, as long as it's well-made, of course.
*: 
	Ah, a fine example of a Whealbrook sapphire, if I'm not mistaken!
*: 
	And people say you can't find good quality items these days. This is a fine gem. Large and shiny.
	What more could you want?
*: 
	Well, that's what most people would tell you.
	But I've got plenty of gems that outclass this one.
	Back at the house, you know.
*: 
	A Zizzwizz Pillow from Roundbeck,
	if I'm not mistaken.
*: 
	They're very famous, of course, but why people put any value on something you can get for free is beyond me!
*: 
	Hm. What's this?
	What a grubby tea set!
*: 
	I suppose there's something to be said for the craftsmanship that's gone into it perhaps, but...
	I don't know.
*: 
	Isn't anyone employed to polish
	the exhibits around here?
*: 
	Ah! The famous tea set from Uptaten Towers.
*: 
	Yes, it's splendid. Of course, you have to insist on quality these days. The set I use at home is... Yes, I'd say it's even a little better than this one.
*: 
	Good Goddess! The Crown of Count Uptaten!
*: 
	You only find quality like this in the region of Uptaten. It's an absolutely wonderful piece.
*: 
	I'd say it's rather valuable too. I'll have to order a crown of similar stature for my collection. Don't like to be outdone, you know!
*: 
	What on earth's that? It's just a blooming branch, isn't it?
*: 
	There's certainly something rather enigmatic
	about it, but still, a branch is a branch. It doesn't have any value.
*: 
	What? It's a sprig of blossom from a village full of faeries? Don't be absurd! There's no such thing as faeries. It's just a branch.
*: 
	Ah, the beautifully formed marital organ of Coburg. Yes, it was made by one of Coburg's
	finest craftsmen.
*: 
	I know because he also made the exquisite timepiece I have in the hallway at home.
*: 
	Oh dear! Look at this empty setting. It looks like the money ran out before the jewel could be set in place. What a shame, it really rather spoils it.
*: 
	Oh, yes! A fine organ! And the gem set into it is absolutely stunning.
*: 
	It pains me to say that I can't compete. I don't have anything like this at home.
*: 
	I'll have to whip my craftsman into action and get him to knock up something better that'll knock your socks off!
*: 
	Oh yes, that's one of the rather crude images the sisters of Heaven's Above Abbey make as charms for travellers.
*: 
	I don't mean to be rude, of course. I'm sure they work very hard at them. They're just rather, well...shabby, aren't they?
*: 
	Oh good, I'm glad you agree. I don't believe in the Goddess and all that divine guidance mumbo-jumbo.
*: 
	Oh! What, you think it's got some value, do you?
	Then you'd better keep it safe. The Goddess comes to help Her believers...or so I've heard.
*: 
	Isn't that the slime curio from the Old Curiosity Shop in Fortuna?
*: 
	Yes, I had someone make me a similar thing once, but it just didn't have the same ⓗje ne sais quoiⓘ...
*: 
	I'd pay three hundred thousand gold coins for that any day of the week. No, every day of the week! You're a lucky %A0110%Xfellow%Z%B0110%Xlady%Z.
*: 
	One of Lodestar Harbour's famous
	ships in bottles, eh?
*: 
	Judging by the detail on the ship, it must have been made by a fairly skilled craftsman. It's probably worth a reasonable amount of gold.
*: 
	Dearie me! A terrorcrow!
*: 
	What were they thinking, making such a
	terrifying scarecrow?
*: 
	The people of Hay must've had a frightful pest they needed to scare off to come up with that. It's worthless, I'm quite sure. Impressively worthless!
*: 
	Oh, that stuff's the best! Zoomshine's absolutely legendary, you know.
*: 
	It tastes so good, just looking at it gets your mouth watering.
*: 
	I'll have to send someone over to Zoomingale to order a case for the house.
*: 
	Oooh, honey buns! They're made by a famous pastry chef in the Mostroferrato region, I believe.
*: 
	They're absolutely delicious, but they are just sticky buns when all's said and done. They're not worth much.
*: 
	Ah, the so-called ⓗscintillating sinterⓘ bath crystals of Stockenbarrel.
*: 
	It's famous as a treatment for exhaustion.
	It totally rejuvenates you. Yes, it's shot up in
	price recently, you know.
*: 
	Mind you, that's because I bought up the entire stock. But it was worth it, I feel as fit as a fiddle every morning now.
*: 
	I believe that's a desert rose from the queendom of Helmunaptra, isn't it?
*: 
	Anyone can pick up one of them if they just wander around in the desert for a while.
*: 
	I admit it's rather mystifying how the sand forms the rose pattern like that, but they're all over the place. They're two to a gold coin.
*: 
	That must be one of those chocolate medalliyums that are on sale at King Dominicus's Dominion.
*: 
	They're just run-of-the-mill souvenirs really. Not worth anything more than what you pay for them.
*: 
	The story goes that a long time ago there was a king who decided to scatter these maxi medals around the world in a sort of treasure hunt game.
*: 
	But they were so big, they were an absolute doddle to find, so he decided to melt them all down and make them into mini medals instead.
*: 
	So you don't see many of these maxi medals any more, I can tell you. I certainly don't have one. It must be very valuable.
*: 
	Oh, yes. One of these is a must if you go hiking in the mountains. It's a Batten binnacle, you know.
*: 
	It's a tough trek up to Battenberg. I equip every single member of my staff with one of these, you know. Hang the expense, I say!
*: 
	This comes from the Gotha region, I believe.
	It's a monster chess set, if I'm not mistaken.
*: 
	You come across all manner of boards, from the second-rate to the sublime, but this is one of the better examples.
*: 
	Yes, it's about on a par with my set at home, I should think. Well nearly, anyway. Hah hah hah.
*: 
	Oh, yes. The intricate, almost gaudy, decoration... This can only be the ⓗLofty Liltsⓘ from Lofty Peak.
*: 
	I can't say it appeals to me, but some people go mad about it.
*: 
	I'd say it's worth quite a bit.
*: 
	What's that? Surely a little sapling like that isn't worth anything, is it?
*: 
	Really? You'll have to enlighten me, then. I'm almost dying with curiosity.
*: 
	No, I didn't think so. It'd be a bit of a shock to learn that puny saplings could fetch good money.
*: 
	I'm sure I'm way off here, but is that a genuine Yggdrasil sapling?
*: 
	Well! I didn't expect that! You're full of surprises, aren't you?
*: 
	I thought maybe it was plastic or something.
	You don't see such a valuable piece of greenery
	on display in a museum like this every day!
*: 
	Ha ha ha! No, you wouldn't expect to see an Yggdrasil sapling in a dingy old museum like this, would you?
*: 
	I mean, even I don't own one of them.
*: 
	Oh, is that what they call a faerie quill?
*: 
	The plumage looks incredibly well-made. Almost real, even. Obviously it's manufactured though, isn't it?
*: 
	Impressive. Naturally, my craftsmen make things like this all the time, but it's still very impressive.
*: 
	You're trying to tell me it's real? I don't know about that. Perhaps you'd like to prove that to me sometime, hm?
*: 
	Who on earth would illustrate something
	so creepily?
*: 
	What? It's from a town in Nadiria?
	You mean, the underworld!?
*: 
	Ha ha ha! Very funny. But you'll have to try harder than that to fool me, I'm afraid.
*: 
	I didn't think so. Someone's just been having a bit of fun doodling, haven't they? It is creepy, though. Really creepy.
*: 
	Goodness! Isn't that a copy of the
	Scuttlebutt Alledger?
*: 
	Hah hah hah! And you think that's something to put on display in the museum?
*: 
	My staff use that kind of thing as scrap paper! It's not good for anything more than that!
*: 
	No? Well anyway, it's utterly worthless.
	You'll be laughed off the premises if you put something like that on display.
*: 
	That's the Forget-me-Knot flag you get for staying a certain number of nights in the Knot Welcome Inne, isn't it?
*: 
	It's interesting as a piece of craftsmanship, but it's completely worthless. I've got a mountain of
	them at home.
*: 
	Is that a tusk-tusk tusk inkwell? And did I get
	the right number of ⓗtusksⓘ? It's extremely valuable, you know.
*: 
	They say it has unusual powers too. On account of some ancient production method known only to
	the people of Northminster.
*: 
	Of course, no one really knows if it really does or not. Have special powers, I mean.
*: 
	Is that some kind of musical instrument?
	That may be what people call the ghoulroarer.
*: 
	What? If you whirl it around, it makes the sound of people screaming?
*: 
	How ridiculous!
*: 
	Ah, a locket. And judging by the design, I'd say it belonged to Princess Mada.
*: 
	Hah hah hah! Surprised? I attended her wedding, you see. That's how I know.
*: 
	But there should be a picture that goes in it, you know. I wonder what happened to it.
*: 
	Well! That's Queen Mada of Gotha's locket.
*: 
	A Gothan craftsman put his heart and soul into making this for King Pankraz and Queen Mada's wedding.
*: 
	And the picture's inside, as well.
	Wonderful! An absolutely wonderful piece!
*: 
	Well, well. Where on earth did you come across this fine-looking trophy?
*: 
	Once you've set eyes on it, you just can't draw yourself away, can you?
*: 
	What? It's from Nadiria?
	I had no idea they had such fine things. I wonder what you have to do to get residence there.
*: 
	There have been a lot of shady characters coming and going, but no incidents to report as yet.
*: 
	Nothing to report!

Sue Veneer
	It's a toff's tea seⓚⓛ
	Oops! I mean, a posh tea set.
Sue Veneer
	Well, silverware's a bit pricey. It's the sort of thing ye'd find in a castle or the like, I should think.
Sue Veneer
	The tea set? Y'already have it, ye daft eejit.
Sue Veneer
	Although, is it just me, or does it look like it's been neglected a wee bit?
Sue Veneer
	A blooming branch!? I did hear sometin' about a special branch that was always in bloom or sometin' like that...
Sue Veneer
	I thought ye told me ye had one yerself once.
	Have ye forgotten it somewhere, have ye?
Sue Veneer
	A crude image? Of the Goddess, ye mean?
Sue Veneer
	I did hear about an abbey somewhere where the nuns spend all day makin' images o' the Goddess

Sue Veneer
	A Zizzwizz Pillow?
	They're mighty comfortable.
	I'm a total convert.
Sue Veneer
	Now where in the world did I lay me hands on my one? Honest to the Goddess, I can't remember. It must've been an inn, I s'pose, bein' a pillow an' all.

	Oh, ye'd put the fear o' the Goddess in people with a terrorcrow like that! It's awful scary, so it is.
Sue Veneer
	Whoever made it must've been havin' a terrible time of it in the fields.
Sue Veneer
	ⓙTis the local brew of Zoomingale, that.
	I've heard talk about it often enough, but I've never actually seen it meself.
Sue Veneer
	The good folk of Zoomingale treat it like gold dust, so they do. Ye can only lay yer hands on it if ye know someone from there, or so I hear.
Sue Veneer
	I don't know what in the world this is.
	It's a strange-looking thing, isn't it? Probably sometin' to do with one of yer friends, I should think.
Sue Veneer
	Isn't that that nice marital organ?
	I thought y'already had that, didn't ye?
Sue Veneer
	I don't know, though. 'Tis a wonderful knick-knack, but I just feel like there's sometin' missin'.
Sue Veneer
	That's from Fortuna, isn't it? I'm dead curious about it meself. I wonder if they wouldn't sell ye one there.
Sue Veneer
	The Scuttlebutt Alledger? Now allegedly, it's kept in an inn where folk like to get together fer a chinwag, but I don't know the truth of it.
Sue Veneer
	The red and white honey buns?
	Surely ye don't need to ask me about them.
Sue Veneer
	They were a gift at yer weddin', %a000090, remember? When ye married %a001230? They're a speciality of Mostroferrato.
Sue Veneer
	I heard they started sellin' ships in bottles in some town by the sea recently. Where was it now?
Sue Veneer
	A desert rose? Phew! That's a bit romantic now,
	isn't it?
Sue Veneer
	They're mighty hard to come by, so I hear.
	Ye have to take lodgin's in some inn in the
	middle o' the desert, apparently.
Sue Veneer
	Scintillating sinter? They used to sell it in a spa town up in the mountains, ye know.
Sue Veneer
	But it's murder to get hold of now. No one's sellin' it at all at all. I s'pose someone must still have some,
	but I don't know who.
Sue Veneer
	A chocolate medalliyum? They look like mini medals,
	so there's only one place ye'd go to buy them now, isn't there?
Sue Veneer
	A Forget-me-Knot flag?
Sue Veneer
	Knot? Isn't that the name o' the famous inn at the foot o' those tall mountains?
Sue Veneer
	A Batten binnacle? They were ever so famous before, ye know.
Sue Veneer
	But the fella who used to make them's no longer about, and they're pretty rare now.
Sue Veneer
	A monster chess set? I'm sorry, I don't know much about them meself.
Sue Veneer
	I don't know much about that meself.
	But it looks mighty precious if y'ask me.
Sue Veneer
	It's some kind of locket, is it?
	'Tis ever so beautifully made.
Sue Veneer
	But it's a wee bit sad, isn't it?
	I mean, there's no picture in it or anytin'.
Sue Veneer
	A tusk-tusk tusk inkwell?
	I'm not so familiar with them meself.
Sue Veneer
	I hear folk use the tusks of the tusk-tusk monster that lives in the north to make inkwells.
	That's all I know about it.
Sue Veneer
	ⓗLofty Liltsⓘ? I expect it's a collection of prayer songs and poems and the like, isn't it?
Sue Veneer
	It must be an almighty holy place where they put sometin' like that together.
Sue Veneer
	A Whealbrook sapphire? 'Tis one of me favourite knick-knacks.
Sue Veneer
	I think ye have to find the rough stone first, an' then give it to a craftsman who can cut it and polish it an' all that stuff.
Sue Veneer
	The Crown of Uptaten? Uptaten's a sad place
	from what I hear. 'Twas overrun by monsters,
	so they say.
Sue Veneer
	It'd be a nice gesture to the Count and Countess to have the crown on display here in the museum.
Sue Veneer
	A faerie quill? Ye can imagine a scholar usin' sometin' like this in a faerie palace or some such place.
Sue Veneer
	An Yggdrasil sapling? That's one knick-knack I'd like fer meself. If they really exist, that is.
Sue Veneer
	It's not the sort o' thing ye'll find many folk with.
Sue Veneer
	An Yggdrasil sapling? Y'already have yerself one o' these, don't ye?
Sue Veneer
	But I don't know... Shouldn't ye be nurturin' it and helpin' it to grown an' that?
Sue Veneer
	The Annalum Retentium? I've never seen it meself,
	so I can't tell ye much about it really.
Sue Veneer
	I think it was written as a kind o' warnin' or sometin'. 'Tisn't the kind o' souvenir ye'd expect to pick up in a normal town, if y'ask me.
Sue Veneer
	I'm sorry. I don't know the first thing about that. 'Tisn't like anytin' ye'd find in this world, if y'ask me.
Sue Veneer
	I can't tell ye much about that knick-knack,
	other than that ye'd probably be mighty happy
	if y'owned it.

	There's no need to worry about that old father of yours. You just stick by your husband and go where he goes.

	Thanks for that. It reminds me of talkin' to Mum, talkin' to you. Ha ha!

	It's a relief that our Bianca found a nice fella like you to get wed to.

	I dun't have any kiddies of me own, so I think of her almost like me own daughter.
*: 
	That old dad of yours is lookin' much better just lately, Bianca.
Bianca

Whitey
	D'you know, it was such a relief when the pair of you got married that it was like some kind of miracle cure for me!
Whitey
	I hope you'll both be very happy together.
Whitey
	Hello there, %a000090.
	Bianca not with you today?
Whitey

	You lucky young devil. She's a real catch. A bit feisty, mind you, but a lovely lass.
Bianca
	Hey! Watch your mouth, old man! I'm right here, you know!
*: 
	There's a chap called Whitey livin' at the far end of the village. That daughter of his is a real beauty.
*: 
	What I'd give to be able to marry that one! My right arm at the very least!

*: 
	She's not here at the moment, I'm afraid.
	She's always out and about durin' the day.
*: 
	Come to see Bianca, have you?
*: 
	She's not here at the moment, though. You'll have to come back of an evenin'.

	Ooh! You're the lovely girl from Mostroferrato, en't you? Tell that husband of yours I said hello.
Whitey
	(cough cough)
	Well! If it en't %a000090!
Whitey
	Seein' you standin' there really reminds me of your poor old dad, Pankraz.

Whitey
	(cough cough)

	It's all the better now because it gives you a taste of the outside world, holding somethin' so exotic.
*: 
	Well, that's a disappointment. I was planning on giving you some scintillating sinter in return, as well...
King Wilbur
	Ah, hello there! What a pleasure to see you!
	I've been hearing all about you from that brother of mine.
King Wilbur
	I've been having my people look into this matter of the legendary hero for you. Sort of as a means of repaying my debt, you know.
King Wilbur
	Now, they've managed to learn that the shield used by this legendary hero currently resides in a town called Mostroferrato.
King Wilbur
	Oh! You have it already! I might've known you'd be on the case, %a000090!
King Wilbur
	I'm sure you'll succeed in finding the legendary hero.
Harry
	Well, well, well! It's %a000090! How wonderful to see you, old friend! Married life going well, is it?
Harry
	Marvellous! Well, you did marry a beauty, after all! ...Er, just like my Maria, of course.
Harry
	So now you have your partner in life, and it's finally time for you to set about finding the legendary hero.
Harry
	I wish I could go with you, but I have Maria
	to think about.
Harry
	Still, hopefully you'll drop in from time to time and keep us posted, eh? It can get a bit boring being stuck here in the castle all the while.
Harry
	By the way, I don't think you've had one of our souvenir marital organs yet, have you?
Harry
	Remember my old room?
	Go and have a look inside the chest there.
Harry
	Ha ha! I know you're only saying that because you're embarrassed to admit you're loving it!
~ %0%a000120 examines the treasure chest. ~
~ It's empty! ~
~ But there seem to be some letters carved on the bottom. %0%a000090 begins to read. ~
~ ⓗI was too embarrassed to say this to your ~
~ face, %a000090, so I thought I'd write it ~
~ here instead. ~
~ ⓗThere's not a day goes by even now when I don't spare a moment to remember your father. ~
~ ⓗDuring our time as slaves, I always had an urge to make it up to you, the fact that I'd lived when he died. ~
~ ⓗIt was that urge that took me through each day and helped me survive that awful time. ~
~ ⓗI don't imagine there's anything in my power I can do to assist you in your quest for the legendary hero. ~
~ ⓗBut it's my sincere hope that ruling this kingdom wisely and protecting my people will be of some help to you in some way or other. ~
~ ⓗYou'll always be my lackey, %a000090... Ha ha ha! No, you'll always be my dear friend.ⓘ ~
Harry
	Hm? You couldn't find the wedding souvenir in the treasure chest?
Harry
	Ha ha ha! You're just as easy to trick as you
	ever were!
Harry
	Very well. I'll give it to you properly this time.
~ Harry proffers a beautifully crafted marital organ! ~
~ %0%a000090 receives the marital organ! ~
~ %0%a000180 acquires the marital organ! ~
Harry
	We actually intended to have a jewel set in the lid, but we couldn't find anyone able to do it.
Harry
	Anyway, it's great to see you. You should relax and stay a while now you've come all this way.
Harry
	So now you have your partner in life, and it's finally time for you to set about finding the legendary hero.
Harry
	I wish I could go with you, but I have Maria
	to think about.
Harry
	Still, hopefully you'll drop in from time to time and keep us posted, eh? It can get a bit boring being stuck here in the castle all the while.
Maria
	It's lovely to see you again, %a000090.
Maria
	All Harry ever talks about just lately is the time he spent travelling with you.
Maria
	I don't mind hearing his tales, but it's funny to see how men love their adventures so much.
*: 
	What's a man to do, eh? I ran away from Coburg when things took a turn for the worse, you see.
*: 
	So now I'm stuck because I can't possibly go back to soldierin' after doin' a runner like that.
*: 
	Sounds like it's all back to normal over in Coburg.
	I wonder what fixed everythin'.
*: 
	I'm an old friend of Whitey who used to run the inn. I came back after all these years to pay him a visit.
*: 
	But I'm told he had problems with his health so he sold up and moved to a village in the mountains far across the sea from here.
*: 
	I was hoping to see that daughter of his again. What a shame!
Bianca
	Hey! It's me! Bianca!
*: 
	Beggar me! So it is! What a surprise!
	Haven't you grown, dear?
Bianca
	Dad's doin' just fine too. He's much better now since movin' to somewhere more peaceful.
*: 
	Well, that's good to hear. This place meant
	a lot to him, didn't it?
*: 
	I was a bit worried that it might be too hard on him, havin' to give it up like that.
*: 
	But it's bin a relief seein' you and hearin' that all's well. Send him my regards next time you see him, eh?
*: 
	I'm an old friend of Whitey who used to run this place. I came by to pay him a long overdue visit.
*: 
	But I'm told he had problems with his health so he sold up and moved to a village in the mountains far across the sea from here.
*: 
	I was hoping to see that daughter of his again. What a shame!
*: 
	Eh? You're a friend of Bianca's, are you?
*: 
	And Bianca and Whitey are both keepin' well? That's good to hear!
*: 
	Now I can breathe a big sigh of relief. I'll have to pop over to that Stockenbarrel one of these days and pay them a visit.
*: 
	My old man and I bought this place from a man called Whitaker...ooh, seven years back now, it was.
*: 
	It was obvious it had been well-maintained,
	so it was clearly a good buy.
*: 
	Why dun't you stay the night? We've got a special offer on at the moment where you get a souvenir if you stay two nights or more!
*: 
	Make sure you come and see me after two nights stayin' here, won't you?
*: 
	Hm? You've stayed two nights already?
	What a good customer you are!

Bianca
	Oh! Sorry, %a000090. Did I wake you?
Bianca
	It's just, I've bin thinkin' a lot
	about things in the past.
Bianca
	It's not that I'm feelin' sad or nothin'. That's all done and dusted now, I know that.
Bianca
	Um, can I come over to you, %a000090?
Bianca
	I want you to know...
	I love you.
Bianca
	Don't be mean! I'm comin' anyway.
*: 
	Sounds like all's well over in Coburg again.
*: 
	Now I can start up my tradin' there again with no worries. Mind you, the trip between here and there could be a bit hairy.

*: 
	Good heavens! You're goin' off in search of the legendary hero!? Are you sure that's wise?
*: 
	Actually, I seem to remember hearin' some talk about the legendary hero over in Roundbeck long ago.
*: 
	That's where that old friend of yours, Bianca, lived. I wonder how she's doin' now.
*: 
	Oh! Goodness me! The two of you were married, you say?
*: 
	Then this lovely thing with you
	must be Bianca herself!
Bianca
	That's right, sister! Long time no see. %0%a000090 and I are travellin' the world together now.
*: 
	Lovely! How wonderful that you have someone to help fill the gap that Pankraz left, %a000090.
*: 
	I do hope you manage to find your mother soon too. I'll be prayin' for you.
*: 
	I knew you were jokin'. If he's part of legend already, then he's probably already dead, after all.
*: 
	This used to be a beautiful village back in the day.
*: 
	But then those soldiers came from Coburg and burnt the place to the ground.
*: 
	It's unforgivable! Unforgivable, I tell you! It's all Pankraz's fault, that poor prince goin' missin'!
*: 
	Er, forgive me. I seem to have got a bit carried away.
*: 
	You must be wonderin' what in the world I'm on about, not knowin' Pankraz and all.

*: 
	Easy, man! See ya next time.
*: 
	That special offer of ours was a blast. It's all done and dusted now.
*: 
	Peace. If you head on over north from here, I guess you'll come to Gotha eventually.
*: 
	You have to climb over some pretty high mountains on the way, though. Tough work, huh?
*: 
	If you're thinkin' of doin' it, you should try to take a rest here first. Just chill, man!
*: 
	It's kind of a shame that the last of
	the Forget-me-Knot flags have just run
	out with you.
*: 
	I was thinkin' of gettin' some pals together and stayin' at the inn to get one myself, y'know.
*: 
	I'm a travelling nun. May I ask if you're planning on travelling to Gotha from here?
*: 
	I was there not long ago, and I must say there was a rather sinister feeling in the air.
*: 
	Do be careful if you're heading that way.
*: 
	Granny Knot's son was gooing crazy with the old needle and thread until just recently.
*: 
	All you could hear from him was ⓗOuchⓘ and ⓗAarghⓘ. (slurp) He was really noisy.
*: 
	Hey, man. Peace, and welcome to the Knot Welcome Inne! We've got some kinda offer-type thing goin' on right now.
*: 
	Hey, man. Peace, and welcome to the Knot Welcome Inne!
Granny Knot
	Zzzz... Zzzz...
