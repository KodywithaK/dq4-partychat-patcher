	Did you see that!? That huge great rock just melted away into nothing!
Sancho
	Look, friend! There ees a castle at the
	bottom of the lake!
%0%a001250
	That magma staff is really frightening. Imagine what damage it could do if it fell into the wrong hands.
%0%a001240
	This place doesn't feel like a normal cave.
	It's like someone made it. See! The rock there
	is cut dead straight!
Tuppence
	Good heavens! How deep do you suppose
	this cave is?
Sancho
	Ees very dark. You must be careful where you are walking. You no come crying eef you fall over, okay?
%0%a001250
	I don't really like the dark, but I'll try not to let it get to me. At least it's better than being somewhere
	high up.
Sancho
	Uf! I was no expecting to find esometheeng
	like thees!
%0%a001240
	Hey, Dad! Can we have a ride on that thing?
	I reckon it'd be a right laugh!
%0%a001250
	I've never seen a cart like that before.
%0%a001240
	Wow! Look at all those carts! How are we supposed to decide which one to get on?
%0%a001250
	I'm a bit nervous of riding about on these carts.
	...I suppose I'm quite excited too, though.
Sancho
	Your Uncle Sancho, he ees never riding on esometheeng like thees before. Ees, ees eso exciting!
Tuppence
	So all we have to do to reach our goal is clamber aboard a cart and settle down for the ride?
	Ha! If only it were that simple.
Sancho
	You know, I no mind the espeed of the carts eso much now, but these jumps! Anda! Ees escary, eh?
%0%a001250
	Um... So we go over there... Then up there... Change the points... And... Oh! I'm completely confused!
%0%a001250
	Do you think it's safe just to get on these things without a grand plan, Dad? What happens if we get lost and can't find our way out of here?
%0%a001240
	I know! We should have a ride on every single cart there is! It's just so much fun!
Tuppence
	Yippee! I never imagined such a fantastically fun place existed! It's things like this that make travelling impossible to give up.
Tuppence
	Think how much fun it would be if we had
	something like this in Gotha. It would speed
	patrol duty up no end.
Sancho
	You no get wet before, friend?
	Thees waterfall, he has a mind of hees own, eh?
%0%a001250
	I'm quite keen on these carts now. Can we have a few more goes on them, Dad?
%0%a001240
	We'll have to bring Uncle Bertie with us next time. He'd love it here!
%0%a001240
	I didn't expect to find a priest in here.
	He was a bit of a strange one.
Tuppence
	It would be nice if we didn't have to encounter any more monsters now. Much more enjoyable.
%0%a001240
	Did you hear that? It's a cart going round!
	We should go and have a look.
Sancho
	We must help thees señor.
	Quick, friend!
%0%a001240
	You'd think he'd be enjoying going round and round like that. It doesn't sound like it, though.
%0%a001250
	Watching him whirling around is starting to make me feel dizzy.
Tuppence
	How terrifying! That's what happens if you just clamber on without thinking about lining
	your points up first.
Sancho
	Ees broken!
	We must help thees señor.
%0%a001250
	Oh no! He took quite a pounding there.
	Do you think he's alright?
Tuppence
	Er... I w-won't tell anyone, don't worry. If he's kicked the bucket, I mean.
%0%a001240
	Is it broken now? Won't it go round and
	round any more?
Sancho
	Qué!? Ees thees the way I breeng you up, friend?
	No, ees no!
%0%a001250
	We have to help him, Dad!
Sancho
	Maybe ees good that ees broken. You never know eef another señor, he ees gonna be estuck on thees cart.
%0%a001240
	It doesn't look like this can be fixed. That's a pity.
%0%a001240
	At least Dr Agon wasn't hurt. And it's nice to have someone else on the team for a while.
Sancho
	Anda! Now we have a clown een the party!
	You theenk he ees really a Zenithian?
%0%a001250
	Um, Dad... That Dr Agon is odd, isn't he? I'm not sure what it is, but there's just something a bit weird about him.
Dr Agon
	We Zenithians usually live to a ripe old age, y'know.
Dr Agon
	But I tell you, twenty years going round on
	that thing, and I'm as hungry as a caterpillar
	in a coal mine!
Tuppence
	I always thought the Zenithians were supposed to be a beautiful and cultured race. I must admit that I'm rather taken aback by this character.
%0%a001250
	Why do the archaeologists send other people in to do their work for them? That doesn't seem right.
%0%a001240
	A fun place like this surely can't have been built by someone evil! It must've been the Goddess who did it.
Sancho
	How long ees thees señor down here?
	Ees esuch a shame for heem.
Tuppence
	It may be a thrill riding about on the carts, but I certainly wouldn't want to be stuck in here with no way of leaving.
%0%a001240
	Do you think Dr Agon really is a Zenithian?
%0%a001240
	I mean, he's totally different to all the other Zenithians we've met. And he doesn't have
	any wings, either.
%0%a001240
	Huh. I really wanted a go on that spinning
	cart myself.
%0%a001250
	I can't seem to relax when Dr Agon's about.
	I wonder why.
%0%a001250
	We'd better hurry on out of here, Dad.
Sancho
	The family of thees señor Agon, they must be eso worried, no? We must take heem to esee
	them quickly.
Sancho
	Twenty years... Maybe eet feels like a long time to you, friend, but when you are old like your Uncle Sancho, eet goes eso fast.
Sancho
	But maybe ees no the esame eef you are on a cart all the time, like thees señor Agon, eh?
Tuppence
	That's incredible! Twenty whole years spinning around in circles, and yet he doesn't have a hair
	out of place!
Tuppence
	I'll have to remember to pick his brains for some hairstyling tips.
Tuppence
	It's rather fortunate that Dr Agon did decide to have a ride on that cart.
Tuppence
	Otherwise I might've been the one who ended up stuck on the thing for twenty years solid!
Dr Agon
	Gee whillikers, it's been an age since I last had the chance to flap the old facehole!
Dr Agon
	Am, am I talking properly? Tell me if I'm using any fun-diddly-unny words, will you, friend? I guess the old licker might be a bit rickety-rusty.
Dr Agon
	I guess you look at me and see a jolly Joe with a fresh young smile, but I've been alive a thousand times longer than any of you!
Dr Agon
	Huh? You think I'm joking? Ha ha hah! Sure, why not? If that's the way you lickety-like it!
Dr Agon
	Hmm... You've had your fair share of suffery-duffery-doodling, eh, %a000090, old buddy? Nothing gets past the old Agon peepers, you know!
Dr Agon
	How do you like my outfit, then?
	It used to put the ⓗpiⓘ in pizzazz twenty years ago. Everyone wanted a piece of my style!
Dr Agon
	Ⓠ Round and round we go! Ⓠ
	Ⓡ Round and round we go-diddly-o! Ⓡ
Dr Agon
	Sorry about that. After twenty years on the old circuit, I just can't relax unless I'm chasing my tail!
%0%a001240
	Hey! There's Dr Agon. How did he get there?
%0%a001250
	You don't think Dr Agon's angry, do you, Dad?
	We've kept him waiting quite a while now.
Sancho
	Qué? Where deed...? Thees señor Agon, he no want to leave thees place, eh?
Tuppence
	Oh. It looks like Dr Agon's been waiting for us.
Tuppence
	The thought obviously hasn't even crossed his mind that he could find his way to Zenithia alone.
Bianca
	Ha! I had no idea there was a cave like this here.
Bianca
	Eh? You've bin here before, have you? I'm startin' to think you've bin everywhere!
Nera
	I wonder who built this. What a curious place!
%0%a001240
	I know my way all around this cave! I reckon I could navigate it even with my eyes closed.
%0%a001240
	This is my favourite cave ever! The carts are brilliant. You must think so too, right, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I don't have a big destiny to fulfil like %a001240 because I'm not the legendary hero, so can I play here a bit longer?
Sancho
	Hahh... Hahh...
	Wait a momento, friend. Hahh...
	Ees time...for a siesta.
Sancho
	I know you want to play, friend, but ees no a good time. You play when your Uncle Sancho, he ees no here, okay?
Tuppence
	I wonder what actually powers all the carts in here. I suppose it must be magic.
Bianca
	Now's not the time for a joyride, %a000090!
	We have to get ourselves over to Nadiria before
	it's too late.
Bianca
	I can't help wonderin' who built this place and
	why, mind. It's not just s'posed to be a theme
	park, surely?
Nera
	What a delightful place! If only we could just
	forget our duties and let our hair down and
	enjoy it properly!
Nera
	We'll have to all come back here again when the world's at peace. We could bring a picnic and make
	a day of it.
%0%a001250
	Do you think that man did something so bad that he really deserves to be shut up in here for so long?
%0%a001240
	A fun place like this surely can't have been built by someone evil! It must've been the Goddess who did it.
Sancho
	How long ees thees señor down here?
	Ees esuch a shame for heem.
Tuppence
	It may be a thrill riding about on the carts, but I certainly wouldn't want to be stuck in here with no way of leaving.
Debora
	I'm not usually keen on caves.
	They're so dark and claustrophobic.
	This one isn't like all the others, though.
Debora
	I never expected to find an amusement ground all the way out here! I wonder who built it.
Debora
	Why would anyone build something like this in a cave? It'd be so much nicer if it was outdoors.
Debora
	So he's been stuck in here digging all this time? Maybe it's punishment for doing something he shouldn't have.
Debora
	Imagine being holed up in here all alone like that!
	I don't think I could stand it.
Debora
	It's terrible to make someone work in this dank and smelly hole! I'd do my best to escape if it were me.
