	I wonder what kind of potential she's talking about.
	There are so many different kinds.
	Hundreds and hundreds, potentially...
Sancho
	Een these displays, thees señora esees the potential of the mankind.
Sancho
	Sí, eshe ees a very eshrewd señora.
Bianca
	It is bustlin', that's for sure. Shame we en't chargin' an entrance fee, eh?
Nera
	It's a wonderful feeling seeing all these people who've made such an effort to come and see the exhibits we've put on display, isn't it?
%0%a001240
	It seems like ages ago now that this place was just a cobwebby old place with nothing in it.
%0%a001250
	It's such a great feeling to see all these people here.
Sancho
	Look at all these señores and señoras!
	Eet, eet makes me eso happy!
	Sí, ees a great knick-knackatory.
Tuppence
	I bet Old Man Nick's as chuffed as cheese!
Bianca
	We have got quite a collection goin' now, eh?
	Just goes to show how many places we've bin to.
Nera
	It's travelling with you that made me realise how wonderful the world we live in is.
%0%a001240
	All of the rooms look different once you put a few knick-knacks in them, don't they?
%0%a001250
	I like pretty little knick-knacks too.
	They're my favourite.
Sancho
	You have the eye for beauties, sí, friend?
	Ees a good idea to make the displays like thees.
Tuppence
	Well everyone likes to gaze on something pretty,
	don't they?
Bianca
	It could be fun havin' different foods on display.
	Hmm, not sure they'd age very well, mind!
Nera
	Papa always says that good food needs more than a good flavour to become a haute cuisine speciality.
Nera
	It needs that little something more...
%0%a001240
	Those paellas Sancho makes should be on display here. They're amazing!
%0%a001250
	I'll be first in line to try some of whatever it is he cooks if it ever does end up being on display here. 
Sancho
	I no like to clack my own castanets, but my cooking ees esometheeng especial, no? You like my paella, sí?
Tuppence
	Do men who can cook attract the ladies?
	Perhaps I ought to don an apron once in a while.
Bianca
	I seem to remember sayin' it was my dream to run an inn, back when I was her age.
Nera
	Perhaps that little girl will grow up to be an accomplished artisan.
%0%a001240
	Maybe I should try making something too.
%0%a001250
	I wonder what sort of thing she has in mind.
	It'd be great if we could put something of hers on display for her, wouldn't it?
Sancho
	These dreams, they, they are eso important.
	They eshape the man you become een the future.
Sancho
	You must hold your dreams close to
	your heart.
Tuppence
	Sounds like the little girl's got quite a future ahead of her!
Bianca
	Everyone's welcome here, no matter what the purpose of their journey is.
Nera
	The knick-knackatory is a good place for people to have a rest, I suppose.
%0%a001240
	I hope more and more travellers come by here and look at all the things we've put on display.
%0%a001250
	It doesn't matter if people plan to come here or just stumble on the place. The more the merrier.
Sancho
	Ees good eef the travellers, they can have the siesta here too, no?
Tuppence
	Ah, yes. You can't beat finding a good place to catch forty winks.
Bianca
	I wonder if he was here researchin' somethin' or other. I hope the place can be of use to him.
Nera
	I heard that some people like to carry out research on the world's various regional souvenirs.
%0%a001240
	Studying from books is all well and good, but
	it's better if you can actually get to see the real thing too.
%0%a001250
	Do you think he came here to study?
Sancho
	Sí, sí. Thees museum ees just right for estudying the cultures and the foreign places, no?
Tuppence
	I wouldn't be surprised if he bored a hole in the exhibits looking at them so intently like that!
Bianca
	It's nice to see things in a museum, but you can't beat havin' somethin' nice on display at home.
Nera
	Any souvenir is a wonderful gift, because it shows you were thinking of someone on your travels.
Nera
	I'm sure she'll be delighted with whatever he decides to buy in the end.
%0%a001240
	It's good not knowing what souvenir you're going to buy. You can have fun looking at all the different things on sale!
%0%a001250
	I'd be happy with anything that was given to me if it was given with love.
Sancho
	Maybe ees a good idea eef we choose for thees señor the good esouvenir, no?
Tuppence
	It's the thought that counts after all, isn't it?
	Well, the present's got to be half-decent as well,
	if you ask me.
Bianca
	Well, if someone artistic like him reckons they're beautiful, then they must be!
Nera
	What an accomplished performer, just making up
	a poem about the knick-knackatory on the spot
	like that!
%0%a001240
	...And all the wonderful displays,
	that did the visitors amaze,
	were collected by none other than %a001240!
%0%a001240
	Well, what do you think?
	Could I be a poet too?
%0%a001250
	What a superb poem! I think it's even more entertaining than the exhibits!
Sancho
	Sí, I know ees full of the wonderful displays, but ees no good to make eso much noise.
Sancho
	Ees a museum. You no make a noise een the museum. Eet must be esilence all the time.
Tuppence
	Now everyone's looking at him rather than the exhibits! I bet he feels stupid!
Bianca
	I wonder whereabouts he's from.
Nera
	Which is the exhibit from his country, do you think?
%0%a001240
	If it's something that's on display here, it means we must've been to wherever he comes from, doesn't it?
%0%a001250
	I suppose it does kind of advertise places if we put exhibits from them on display here.
Sancho
	For the countries that we are displaying their esouvenirs, ees good eef muchos travellers
	are visiting them, sí?
Tuppence
	Must be a bit of a strain having to worry about an entire country. I don't think I'd be cut out for it.
Bianca
	Prettiness is in the eye of the beholder, though, eh? Different things appeal to different folk.
Nera
	It sounds like that young woman saw something on display she rather liked.
%0%a001240
	If I had to choose one trinket from all the things in here, I'd take one of the really amazing inventions. Something really interesting.
%0%a001250
	Yeah. I'd quite like a pretty little trinket too.
Sancho
	Sí, sí. Everyone likes the pretty displays, but ees the inside that counts. We have the esaying where I come from: faces we esee, hearts we don't know.
Tuppence
	Pretty little trinket? Yes, she certainly is that!
Bianca
	Sounds like he was expectin' the exhibits to be a bit more on the grand side, eh?
Nera
	It's true, I suppose. This grand old building makes some of the exhibits look a bit out of place.
%0%a001240
	I like the funny novelty exhibits best!
%0%a001250
	I like the novelty exhibits too, but if I had to choose, there are lots of pretty, shiny exhibits I'd pick as my favourites first.
Sancho
	Ees good the clientes, they enjoy the funny exhibits too, no?
Tuppence
	The exhibits need to be ⓗfunnyⓘ. I mean, if they weren't a bit out of the ordinary, they wouldn't make good knick-knacks, would they?
Bianca
	I s'pose some of the stuff is a bit weird. But it's the thought that went into makin' it that counts.
Nera
	What's important is how much care and attention went into creating these souvenirs.
Nera
	I wish people wouldn't just focus on whether the displays look pretty or not.
%0%a001240
	Well, I like the weird exhibits.
	They're the most fun to look at, after all.
%0%a001250
	I don't think they're weird. There's something quite charming about them if you ask me.
Sancho
	Different people, they like different theengs,
	you know.
Sancho
	Esome people, they esee the interesting display, but for others, the esame display, eet ees just esometheeng loco.
Tuppence
	That chap's missing the point. Weird is wonderful, you see, just like big is beautiful.
Bianca
	We have got quite a collection goin' now, eh?
	Just goes to show how many places we've bin to.
Nera
	It's travelling with you that made me realise how wonderful the world we live in is.
%0%a001240
	The whole room feels different when you put lots of weird and wonderful exhibits on display, doesn't it?
%0%a001250
	I like the weird exhibits too, but if I had to choose, there are lots of pretty, shiny exhibits I'd pick as my favourites first.
Sancho
	Sí. Ees eso many different esouvenirs from eso many different lands.
Tuppence
	I suppose it's hardly surprising really, but the more peculiar an exhibit is, the more it seems to stand out.
Bianca
	It's nice to hear folk say things like that.
	Makes you feel all the effort we went to to
	get the stuff was worth it.
Nera
	There are lots of people here who are seeing these regional crafts for the first time in their lives.
%0%a001240
	Since I've been travelling with you, Dad, I've seen loads of things for the first time too.
%0%a001250
	It's so exciting seeing some of these things for the first time, isn't it?
Sancho
	When you esee esometheeng for the first time, you never forget, sí? Eet makes the beeg impression, no?
Tuppence
	That's how I feel about lots of the exhibits in here.
	I've never laid eyes on half of them before in my entire life.
Bianca
	I hope folk don't think the place is stuck-up. The best museums are the ones you can just enjoy without puttin' on any airs.
Nera
	It's good to see all sorts of people enjoying the place. A knick-knackatory should be accessible to everyone!
%0%a001240
	It'd be really boring in here if everyone was being serious and formal.
%0%a001250
	I wonder if lots of people think museums are
	stuck-up places.
Sancho
	Thees señor, he ees the true macho bronco.
	Eet must be very hard for heem to estep eenside thees place, no? But estill he comes een.
Tuppence
	No, a museum's no place for stuck-up, monocled old fuddy-duddies!
Bianca
	It's good if folk are chattin' about this place when they're down the pub. Pub rumours always spread far and wide.
Nera
	It's great that people are chatting about the
	knick-knackatory in their free time.
%0%a001240
	I wonder what the man told him about the place.
%0%a001250
	So he's here on business, then? Poor thing!
Sancho
	Heh heh! Even een the pubs now, they are talking about thees knick-knackatory!
Tuppence
	Chatting about souvenirs to help the grog go down? That's a new one on me!
Bianca
	I reckon it's good if the exhibits are a bit funny, otherwise no one would bother comin' to see 'em.
Nera
	Well I think it's a good thing to have a variety of exhibits on display.
%0%a001240
	I like the funny exhibits. They're, er...funny!
%0%a001250
	If the exhibits are a bit funny, it means the craftsmen must've been fun, interesting people. That's good, isn't it?
Sancho
	Different people, they like different theengs,
	you know.
Sancho
	Esome people, they esee the interesting display, but for others, the esame display, eet ees just esometheeng loco.
Tuppence
	That chap's missing the point. Weird is wonderful, you see, just like big is beautiful.
Bianca
	Fancy bein' the subject of a poem, eh, %a000090?
Nera
	What an accomplished performer, just making up
	a poem about the knick-knackatory on the spot
	like that!
%0%a001240
	That poet can make up a poem about anything!
	It's amazing!
%0%a001250
	What a superb poem! I think it's even more entertaining than the exhibits!
Sancho
	Sí, I know ees full of the wonderful displays, but ees no good to make eso much noise.
Sancho
	Ees a museum. You no make a noise een the museum. Eet must be esilence all the time.
Tuppence
	Now everyone's looking at him rather than the exhibits! I bet he feels stupid!
Bianca
	She does look a bit out of place dressed like that
	in a museum!
Nera
	She stands out more than the exhibits do!
%0%a001240
	Wow! She's wearing exactly the same outfit as
	Patty the party planner!
%0%a001250
	Do you think she wore that all the way here?
Sancho
	For the young señorita to come to thees
	knick-knackatory een esuch clothes,
	ees, ees, ees...
Tuppence
	A bunny? Looking funny? Never! Bunnies are welcome any time, any place, if you ask me!
Bianca
	You en't got a bit of a thing for her by any chance, have you, %a000090?
Nera
	Don't you mind her wearing that in here, %a000090?
Nera
	No, of course you don't! You're so tolerant of people, aren't you?
%0%a001240
	Wow! She's wearing exactly the same outfit as
	Patty the party planner!
%0%a001250
	Do you think she wore that all the way here?
Sancho
	For the young señorita to come to thees
	knick-knackatory een esuch clothes,
	ees, ees, ees...
Tuppence
	A bunny? Looking funny? Never! Bunnies are welcome any time, any place, if you ask me!
Bianca
	I reckon he's prob'ly some sort of craftsman too, eh?
Nera
	It sounds like he's a craftsman or something like
	that too.
%0%a001240
	That man's cool!
%0%a001250
	I suppose craftsmen never stop studying, do they?
Sancho
	Thees señor, he eseems to be the master craftsman.
Sancho
	But estill he believes he can improve hees technique, you know? Ees thees I admire
	eso much.
Tuppence
	Hmm... There's more to that man than meets the eye.
Bianca
	I s'pose you could say the place is a bit scary. Sounds like she's pretty impressed with you, mind!
Nera
	I don't think the woman dislikes the way you've set the place out, %a000090.
Nera
	It's just that it's not the kind of museum a young lady would like to walk around on her own at night, that's all.
%0%a001240
	A scary knick-knackatory? That makes it a bit like a haunted house, doesn't it?
%0%a001250
	You could change a few of the exhibits, Dad.
	For something less scary, I mean.
Sancho
	Thees señorita, her face ees white like the uncooked tortilla, no? Maybe here ees no
	the place for ladies now.
Tuppence
	Scary? This place? W-Well I'm not scared.
Bianca
	Oops. Sounds like he's regrettin' bringin' her here. Maybe we could try changin' things about a bit so she's not so scared.
Nera
	The poor man's really upset. At least we could change things around so the place isn't so scary
	any more, couldn't we?
%0%a001240
	It's a great place for a honeymoon! I think he's just saying that because he's scared by the exhibits.
%0%a001250
	Lots of the other visitors seem to be scared by the exhibits at the moment, but he's scared his wife doesn't love him!
Sancho
	There are no eso many clientes now, eh, friend?
	Maybe they are no coming because ees eso
	escary here now.
Tuppence
	I bet Old Man Nick would like these displays, being a ghost and all.
Bianca
	He seems to have a bit of a different way of seein' things to other folk. I s'pose that's what bein' in battle all the time does to you.
Nera
	I suppose he's seen so much in all the battles he's fought. It must affect the way you look at things.
%0%a001240
	I don't know what that man said exactly, but it made him sound really cool!
%0%a001250
	I can't even peek at most of the exhibits that are on display at the moment.
%0%a001250
	But that man's been looking straight at them for ages, hasn't he? Wow! He must be so brave!
Sancho
	Sí! You esee? The right kind of
	person, he can appreciate thees display.
Tuppence
	Do you think I might be able to toughen up enough to stare out one of these terrifying exhibits?
Bianca
	Well, you can't accuse him of mincin' his words, eh?
Nera
	Well it's important that people keep at least one or two places where they can go to relax in these troubled times.
%0%a001240
	Does he mean it's just for play?
	Because we don't play most of the time.
	Most of the time we're busy fighting monsters!
%0%a001250
	Why did he bother coming if that's what he thinks?
Sancho
	Ees always important to have the time for relaxing, you know. And for the paella. Sí, sí, sí.
Tuppence
	Sounds like that chap's a bit sore about something if you ask me. Maybe he had a bad experience recently.
Bianca
	He does look a bit of a state. I wonder where it is he's come from.
Nera
	The poor man! He must've had a terribly harsh time of it getting here.
%0%a001240
	I don't think his clothes would've got that messed up just from travelling.
%0%a001240
	Maybe he fought some amazing monster on the way here or something!
%0%a001250
	Do you think he's hurt? I hope he's okay...
Sancho
	Thees señor, he ees no a seasoned
	traveller, eh?
Tuppence
	He's not being serious, is he?
	I mean, he just got changed into those clothes before he came in or something, didn't he?
Bianca
	We have got quite a collection goin' now, eh?
	Just goes to show how many places we've bin to.
Nera
	It's travelling with you that made me realise how wonderful the world we live in is.
%0%a001240
	If you put enough scary exhibits in a room, it makes the whole place feel darker, doesn't it?
%0%a001250
	I don't like scary exhibits. I'm sure I'd end up in tears if I came here at night.
Sancho
	Sí. Ees eso many different esouvenirs from eso many different lands.
Tuppence
	The scary exhibits certainly turn heads, don't they? Actually, you know what would be really scary? A turning head!
Bianca
	I s'pose havin' scary exhibits on display does attract a certain type of customer.
Nera
	Do you get the impression the scary displays are attracting the wrong sort of people?
%0%a001240
	Don't worry! If there's any trouble, you and me will sort it out, right, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I'm sure it's nothing to worry about, but...sometimes I see visitors with really scary eyes.
Sancho
	But thees place, eet ees a museum.
Sancho
	No one ees gonna make trouble een the museum. Ees too quiet, sí?
Tuppence
	Never fear, Tuppence is here! I'll make short work of any troublemakers, you'll see.
Bianca
	I s'pose havin' scary exhibits on display does attract a certain type of customer.
Nera
	Do you get the impression the scary displays are attracting the wrong sort of people?
%0%a001240
	Don't worry! If there's any trouble, you and me will sort it out, right, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I'm sure it's nothing to worry about, but...sometimes I see visitors with really scary eyes.
Sancho
	But thees place, eet ees a museum.
Sancho
	No one ees gonna make trouble een the museum. Ees too quiet, sí?
Tuppence
	I think I'll take the old man's advice and keep
	my distance.
Bianca
	Hmm. I know a weirdo when I see one,
	and he definitely qualifies!
Nera
	But he looks like such a decent, reliable man!
	I certainly wouldn't trust him now, though.
%0%a001240
	That man's not a... He's not a monster...is he?
%0%a001250
	That man's eyes are really scary.
Sancho
	Ees because of these displays. Ees making esuch señores come to the knick-knackatory.
Tuppence
	You don't hear too many ⓗhwa ha haⓘs, eh?
	I mean, most people try to cover up their
	sinister laughs, don't they?
Bianca
	You don't think he's plannin' on nickin' somethin' from our knick-knackatory, do you?
Nera
	I can't help worrying about the exhibits a bit when I see people like that in here.
%0%a001240
	That man's not a... He's not a thief...is he?
%0%a001250
	Every now and then I see people like that man here. You know, people with a scary look in their eyes.
Sancho
	Ees because of these displays. Ees making esuch señores come to the knick-knackatory.
Tuppence
	Uh-oh! Why isn't there a guard on the top floor!?
Bianca
	I'm feelin' a kind of darkness too. You don't think there's really a dark aura here, do you?
Nera
	So I'm not the only one who's feeling it, then?
%0%a001240
	Maybe we'd better not leave these exhibits out for too long then, do you think?
%0%a001250
	That's exactly what I was feeling too!
Sancho
	Sí. Ees true. Ees like we no look at the exhibit.
	The exhibit, ees looking at us!
Tuppence
	That all sounds a bit scary to me.
	I think I'll just pretend I didn't hear it.
Bianca
	That's odd. I wonder how he knows about it.
Nera
	I wonder what he's so flustered about.
%0%a001240
	How come that old man knows about the Catas Trophy anyway? You, you don't think he's from the underworld, do you?
%0%a001250
	Maybe he knows how powerful Estark is.
	Maybe that's why he seemed so worried.
Sancho
	Thees señor, eet eseems he knows the Catas Trophy. He ees no the ordinary cliente, no?
Tuppence
	Oh dear! Is, is something bad going to happen?
	Is there a problem?
Bianca
	It's a bit tricky to know what to display in the best room of the house, eh?
Nera
	Maybe we should try putting different exhibits on display here until the old man seems happy...
%0%a001240
	Something else? But what? There are so many things to choose from.
%0%a001250
	I agree with whatever you choose to put on
	display, Dad.
Sancho
	You know, when you theenk about only the exhibits that are grand enough for thees room, you can make the choices esmaller.
Tuppence
	Something else? I wonder what on earth the old man's hoping we'll put on display here.
Bianca
	What's his problem? Has he just come here to
	annoy us?
Nera
	This must be the man we were told about.
%0%a001240
	He's a bit weird, isn't he? In all the places we've visited up to now, I don't remember meeting anyone quite like him before.
%0%a001250
	I don't like people like him. Will you talk to him, please, so that I don't have to?
Sancho
	Thees señor, he no espeak eso nice, eh?
	But eef he tells us about the exhibits, maybe ees no eso bad.
Tuppence
	This chap's got a bit of a chip on his shoulder,
	hasn't he?
Tuppence
	Who does he think he's talking to, eh?
	Doesn't he know he's addressing King %a000090?
Bianca
	Don't listen to him, %a000090.
	Just do things how you want.
Nera
	He doesn't look all that busy to me.
	What do you think, darling?
%0%a001240
	We have not got a lot of time on our hands!
	We're always busy fighting monsters and stuff!
	Right, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I don't like people like him. Will you talk to him, please, so that I don't have to?
Sancho
	Ees no the time you need for thees. Ees the determination. You must be hungry like the barracuda for just thees one exhibit.
Tuppence
	If you ask me, he looks like he's got a lot more time on his hands than we do.
Bianca
	Don't listen to him, %a000090.
	Just do things how you want.
Nera
	He can't say that! Cuisine is never worthless.
	Papa would have a fit!
%0%a001240
	I don't care what he says. I like chocolate medalliyums, and that's that!
%0%a001250
	I bet he secretly wants us to give all our medalliyums to him. That's why he's saying that.
Sancho
	At least thees señor, he geeves us esome esmall words of encouragement, no?
Tuppence
	Worthless to him, maybe, but I bet chocolate lovers would have something to say about that.
	They'd be furious!
Bianca
	That dun't sound all bad. In fact, I'd say he quite likes it.
Nera
	He certainly keeps a close eye on what's on display, doesn't he? He knows exactly what's on the other floors too.
Nera
	He really does love his souvenirs.
%0%a001240
	Ships in bottles are amazing!
	I never get bored of looking at them.
%0%a001250
	There are ships in bottles everywhere.
	How many did you put on display, Dad?
Sancho
	The more you look at these esheeps een bottles, the more you esee how much work eet must be to make them.
Tuppence
	We're not making fun of anyone!
	There's a reason why you've done this, I'll bet, isn't there, %a000090? A cunning plan or something.
Bianca
	Nothin' he has could outclass that.
	It's from your hometown, after all.
Nera
	We used to have some gemstones at home too.
	Just normal ones, though.
%0%a001240
	He said it was a fine gem, but do you think he
	was lying?
%0%a001250
	He can't bear to be outdone, can he?
Sancho
	Thees señor, he ees esaying a nice theeng about the Whealbrook esapphire, or he ees esaying esometheeng bad?
Sancho
	Eef ees one theeng, I hug heem.
	Eef ees another, I hammer heem!
Tuppence
	Whealbrook's where you used to live, isn't it, %a000090?
Bianca
	What a blimmin' cheek!
Nera
	It sounds like he doesn't put any value on things unless they cost money, no matter how amazing
	they are.
%0%a001240
	But Zizzwizz Pillows are amazing! They're so comfortable, they could send a monster to sleep.
	That man doesn't know anything!
%0%a001250
	Why did that man even come to the knick-knackatory when he doesn't seem to like knick-knacks at all?
Sancho
	Ees no just about the garbanzos...
Tuppence
	I don't think I like the way this fat cat thinks.
Bianca
	I s'pose it is important to keep things in good nick. Maybe we should have a bit of a polish before long.
Nera
	He's right, isn't he? We should polish it up so there's
	a beautiful, gleaming exhibit for him the next time
	we speak.
%0%a001240
	The exhibits do look better when they're all clean
	and shiny.
%0%a001250
	When you clean things, it makes you feel cleaner inside too.
Sancho
	You know, your Uncle Sancho, he ees good at thees kind of work.
Tuppence
	I don't like listening to anything that chap says now, even if it does make perfect sense!
Bianca
	Oh yeah. The toff's tea set! Reminds me of that time we went off ghost-bustin' when we was kids.
Nera
	He just can't help comparing everything here to something he owns at home, can he?
%0%a001240
	I like this tea set. It's really cool!
%0%a001240
	I don't like tea, though. It's really hot. And bitter too.
%0%a001250
	Oops! I wasn't listening! What did he just say?
Sancho
	Ees esometheeng, no? He no esay ees the best, but ees estill good, sí?
Tuppence
	He says it's a decent exhibit, but then he undermines it in his next breath. You just don't know what to believe, do you?
Bianca
	Hah! He'll never be able to get one of them for himself!
Nera
	It really troubles that man if he feels like he can't have something, doesn't it?
%0%a001240
	That man just wants expensive things, doesn't he?
	He doesn't really care about souvenirs and
	knick-knacks.
%0%a001250
	He really hates losing, doesn't he?
Sancho
	Ees no important eef the knick-knacks, they are expensive or they are cheap.
Tuppence
	I don't think I like the way this fat cat thinks.
Bianca
	Mmm... The blossom smells lovely. You're the one who made it bloom too, %a000090.
Nera
	Isn't it amazing? He doesn't feel anything, even
	when presented with something as beautiful as
	this blossom.
%0%a001240
	Isn't it wrong to make snap judgements like that?
%0%a001250
	Fine! We won't bother showing him any more beautiful branches of blossom then! See if we care!
Sancho
	Sí... Thees ees the branch you once breeng een the house when you were just a leettle boy. Sí. I remember...
Tuppence
	He's pretty sure of himself, isn't he?
	I don't think we'll ever manage to convince him.
	Poor, unenlightened fellow.
Bianca
	What's his problem? Is he just here to get on
	our nerves?
Nera
	I don't feel like I want to show this man anything now. He's always so negative.
%0%a001240
	You could find some jewels to fit in there, couldn't you, Dad? Then it would look great!
%0%a001250
	The money didn't run out. It's just that they couldn't find a craftsman to do the work.
Sancho
	Ees only Coburg, but estill... I no like the way thees señor espeaks about the royalty.
Tuppence
	I'm afraid I'm rather offended by that remark!
Bianca
	That gem goes a treat in Harry's music box, eh?
Nera
	I don't even think Papa has a music box that could compete with this one. Isn't it magnificent?
%0%a001240
	I'd love to show it to Prince Harry and everyone now we've made it look so much better.
%0%a001250
	Oh, poor man. He seems a bit bitter. Ha ha ha!
Sancho
	The organ of Coburg, and the esapphire from Whealbrook...
Sancho
	Now these two treasures are together, maybe eet means the places, one day they join together too.
Tuppence
	I'd be interested to see what kind of craftsman would be employed by that man.
Bianca
	The Goddess won't be happy with him for sayin' that! Not that he'll care, mind.
Nera
	The abbey was my home! It's very upsetting when people say disparaging things about it.
%0%a001240
	Well whenever I hold one of those images, I get a warm feeling all over. That man just doesn't get it, does he?
%0%a001250
	Dear Goddess, are you listening to this?
	There's a sinner here who needs to be punished!
Sancho
	Ees, ees eso esad for the esisters who make thees estatue. Eef they heard these harsh words, they, they would be eso hurt.
Tuppence
	The chap's more than a bit indiscreet, isn't he?
Bianca
	I think that's the first time I've heard him so thrilled. He must be really keen on that slime curio.
Nera
	I'm not surprised he hasn't got one. The Old Curiosity Shop owner in Fortuna is very picky about his customers. He wouldn't accept this man.
%0%a001240
	Yes! We've got something that he can't get!
%0%a001250
	What? He likes that weird slime curio?
	That just shows how weird he is!
	
Sancho
	Thees señor, he esay to us he can tell us about the knick-knacks, but eef you ask me, he just tells us about heemself.
Tuppence
	Yes, that slime curio's pretty valuable, isn't it?
	Weren't we told there's only one of them in the
	whole world or something?
Bianca
	You can get 'em easy as pie over in Lodestar Harbour, but they are pretty impressive.
Nera
	The fact that the person who made this managed to produce so many finely crafted souvenirs just goes to show how skilled he must have been.
%0%a001240
	Yeah, ships in bottles are really cool! I could just sit and look at them for hours and hours.
%0%a001250
	It looks exactly like your ship, Dad. It's amazing.
Sancho
	Ees no easy to make the galleon eenside the bottle, you know.
Sancho
	For me, ees no possible. You look at these fingers...
	They are thick like the trunks of the tree, no?
Tuppence
	Made by a real expert, was it? Yes, I suppose
	it was.
Bianca
	A frightful pest? Charmin'! %0%a001210 wouldn't be best pleased to be described like that!
Nera
	I don't really like that thing.
	Don't make me go near it, will you?
%0%a001240
	It's supposed to scare off monsters.
	If it didn't at least scare that man a bit too,
	it wouldn't be much good, would it?
%0%a001250
	I bet the terrorcrow wouldn't be too happy being described as worthless. And you wouldn't want to upset the terrorcrow.
Sancho
	Thees escarecrow, he ees eso escary, ees no just the monsters who no go een the fields.
	Ees the humans too.
Tuppence
	I'm sure that terrorcrow just gave me a
	sideways glance.
Tuppence
	N-No... I, I must've imagined it...
Bianca
	So all he has to do is send someone over and he gets some? I thought it was s'posed to be exclusive stuff!
Nera
	Papa has different drinks delivered to his casino ship from all over the world.
Nera
	But I don't recall seeing any Zoomshine there before. Nothing from Zoomingale at all, as far as I remember.
%0%a001240
	Sancho says only adults are allowed to drink.
%0%a001250
	Oooh... Whenever I get a whiff of that Zoomshine,
	it makes me feel all dizzy...
Sancho
	Sí, sí. Ees good for the cooking, thees kind of dreenk. Qué? Ees too valuable to put een the cooking? You theenk eso?
Tuppence
	If the stuff's as legendary as we've been led to believe, I can't imagine it'll be all that easy to get
	hold of.
Bianca
	They might just be sticky buns to him, but they're special to us, eh?
Nera
	I can understand why he thinks that.
Nera
	I mean, he doesn't know they were made to celebrate our marriage to each other, does he?
%0%a001240
	But they are worth something. They're not just
	any honey buns. They were made especially for
	your wedding.
%0%a001250
	Just think how the poor chef would feel if he heard him say that!
Sancho
	Ees no a good idea to upset the one who makes the food, you know.
Tuppence
	Let me tell you, you don't see honey buns as finely formed as that pair every day, you know.
Bianca
	I'd heard there was a lot of demand for scintillatin' sinter just lately. How typical that he's the root of it!
Nera
	Papa always says that throwing money about without a thought for the people around you will destroy you in the end.
Nera
	Do you think that man's going to be alright?
%0%a001240
	It's wrong to keep everything for yourself.
	You have to share.
%0%a001250
	How much must he have bought to make the price go up so much?
Sancho
	Sí. When I first esee thees señor's eskin, I theenk to myself, the colour, ees eso good.
	Now I know the esecret.
Tuppence
	People with money are always rabbiting on about their health, aren't they?
Bianca
	Wander around in the desert? Pah! I'll bet he's never bin to the desert all his life!
Nera
	Surely being mystifying is a good enough reason for it to be a famous knick-knack, isn't it? I think it is.
%0%a001240
	You can't just wander about and find them.
	It's quite hard, actually. I bet he's never found one.
%0%a001250
	He's never been into the desert himself, so he doesn't know how difficult it is.
Sancho
	The desert? Uf! Just hearing thees word, eet
	makes me esweat.
Tuppence
	He doesn't seem to be interested in anything unless it's got monetary value, no matter how mysterious or unusual it is.
Bianca
	I s'pose he's right, but he dun't have to be quite so rude about 'em, eh?
Nera
	Anything you can eat is worth more than any amount of gold. That's what Papa always taught me.
%0%a001240
	I don't care what he says. I like chocolate medalliyums, and that's that!
%0%a001250
	I bet he secretly wants us to give all our medalliyums to him. That's why he's saying that.
Sancho
	One man, he likes hees food, but hees brother,
	he no likes eet. You know what I mean?
Tuppence
	Worthless to him, maybe, but I bet chocolate lovers would have something to say about that.
	They'd be furious!
Bianca
	I'd never seen a maxi medal before neither.
	I doubt many folk know about 'em.
Nera
	Papa likes collecting rare treasures too, you know.
	I know he'd want one of these. I'm sure of it.
%0%a001240
	This is what Old Man Nick Knack wanted too, isn't it? They must be really valuable.
%0%a001250
	They're definitely too big to play treasure hunting with. You'd see them sticking out behind anything!
Sancho
	Ees very beeg, eh? Maybe ees beeg enough eso you can use eet like a shield, no?
Tuppence
	I'm starting to understand why Old Man Nick Knack wanted one of these so badly now.
Bianca
	So every member of his staff gets one?
	They have it pretty easy, eh?
Nera
	I wouldn't like to be a member of his staff.
%0%a001240
	You don't have to use it up a mountain though, do you? You can use it in other places too, can't you?
%0%a001250
	Does that mean the people who work for that man have to climb mountains a lot?
%0%a001250
	I suppose that's how he manages to collect rare knick-knacks from all over the world.
Sancho
	Thees señor, he geeves all the people who work for heem the compass? Eet esounds like he leeves esomewhere very remote, eh?
Tuppence
	I thought we were told you can't get hold of these Batten binnacles any more. How many do you think this man has got?
Bianca
	But our monster chess set was made by a
	famous craftsman!
Bianca
	There's no way the one he has at home can be better!
Nera
	It sounds like his collection includes items from every corner of the world.
%0%a001240
	Yeah! Gotha's knick-knack's the best!
	You can't beat monster chess!
%0%a001250
	The monster chess sets are really well-made, aren't they? The monsters all look so real.
Sancho
	You theenk thees señor, he went to Gotha to buy a monster chess eset for heemself?
Sancho
	Ees estrange. I believe thees artisan who made the chess esets, he made just enough for the castle and no more.
Tuppence
	Well at least the game my father was so crazy about is getting some recognition at last!
Bianca
	He's prob'ly only callin' it gaudy because he dun't have one of his own to boast about.
Nera
	Gaudy? If there's anything gaudy here, it's the way that man speaks!
%0%a001240
	That's Grandma's book! Of course it's worth a lot.
	Although...I suppose that doesn't make it worth a
	lot to him.
%0%a001250
	He shouldn't say mean things about Lofty Peak or about Grandma. It's not nice.
Sancho
	Maybe ees best eef we no eshow thees señor our knick-knacks, eh?
Sancho
	He ees just making our precious memories dirty.
Tuppence
	I bet that's got you a bit riled, hasn't it, %a000090?
Tuppence
	I don't blame you, the way he's talking about Queen Mada's treasured book like that.
Bianca
	He'd be eatin' his words if he knew it come from the Yggdrasil tree, eh?
Nera
	If you're the right kind of person, you can feel it. You can feel the strange power radiating from
	the sapling.
%0%a001240
	I'd really like to see that man's face when he finds out exactly what this sapling is.
%0%a001250
	All he sees is a tiny shoot. He doesn't know it holds a powerful life force.
Sancho
	You know, your Uncle Sancho, he ees no eso esure, either.
Sancho
	Ees esupposed to be from the Yggdrasil tree een Zenithia, but I no believe eet.
Tuppence
	I bet if he knew it was a sapling of the Great World Tree, he'd change his tune. He'd pay a small fortune for it then.
Bianca
	It's havin' stuff like that on display that makes this place so amazin', eh?
Nera
	He's right about that. It is very rare.
Nera
	Old Man Nick Knack was right to pick you as curator, you see.
%0%a001240
	He'd know for sure if he tried using one of
	the leaves.
%0%a001250
	It's my sapling! I looked after it and helped it grow.
	I'm not showing it to him again!
Sancho
	You theenk ees okay to put esometheeng thees señor no have heemself on display here? Maybe he ees gonna be jealous, eh?
Tuppence
	He hasn't got an eye for knick-knacks at all, has he? Can't he feel that powerful aura it's giving out?
Tuppence
	Actually, to tell the truth, neither can I!
Bianca
	Sounds like he only believes in things he's seen for himself. That must make life a bit borin' for him.
Nera
	Poor man. Do you think he trusts anyone?
%0%a001240
	I'd love to see his face when he finds out it is real!
%0%a001250
	Is that all he can say? What about how beautiful
	it is?
Sancho
	Esometimes I no esure eef thees señor ees
	really the aficionado of the knick-knacks or
	eef he ees just a cowboy.
Tuppence
	Remind me why we're listening to this chap again, would you? He doesn't seem to have anything useful to say at all.
Bianca
	There's no point explainin' it to him.
	He wouldn't believe us.
Nera
	It certainly is creeⓚⓛ
	Er... I mean, it certainly is unusual.
Nera
	He might not be the only person who finds it hard to believe it's a famous souvenir of anywhere.
%0%a001240
	If it wasn't from Precaria, I'd think it was creepy too. But that's the town Mum saved.
%0%a001250
	It just shows how Grandma helped the monsters turn into humans. There's nothing creepy about it.
Sancho
	But thees knick-knack, eet ees from the town señora Mada esaved.
Sancho
	When I try to theenk eef ees creepy or no, my mind, ees, ees just too full of emotions!
Tuppence
	I agree. It gives me the creeps too.
	I can't look at it, personally.
Bianca
	He's so blimmin' rude! Didn't his mum teach him when to keep his mouth shut?
Nera
	I suppose it is a bit different to the other exhibits.
Nera
	But it's the result of hundreds of travellers' work. That gives it a certain value, doesn't it?
%0%a001240
	That's just nasty, what he said. I didn't think adults were supposed to talk like that.
%0%a001250
	As long as it's fun, what's wrong with it?
	It's still a souvenir, isn't it? And that's what the knick-knackatory's here for. Souvenirs.
Sancho
	Esome people, they go to thees inn just to write een thees book.
Sancho
	Ees a good book, sí? Eso many different theengs, they are written eenside.
Tuppence
	I'd like to meet that chap's parents!
	They've got a lot to answer for.
Bianca
	How mean of him, to take 'em and waste 'em like that!
Nera
	But the wiggly stitching is so cute!
	It gives it such a warm, home-made feel.
%0%a001240
	If he's got a mountain of them, surely that means he really likes them, doesn't it?
%0%a001250
	Well I really like those flags. They give you a warm feeling inside.
Sancho
	You theenk thees señor, he puts all hees flags een the storeroom? Ees esuch a shame when esomeone has worked eso hard to make them.
Tuppence
	I think he secretly really likes them.
	Why else would he know so much about them?
Bianca
	That ink is pretty special. Sometimes it looks black, but sometimes it looks all rainbow-coloured.
Nera
	I heard about that ink and how they make it at Northminster from a travelling priest who came
	to the abbey when I was living there.
Nera
	He said the same thing. It's a special ink that never ever fades.
%0%a001240
	Ink usually smells funny, doesn't it?
%0%a001240
	But this ink doesn't. Why is that?
%0%a001250
	Well I believe it. I think it is special.
%0%a001250
	I don't know why, but it just seems special to
	me somehow.
Sancho
	Sí, sí. Ees the eenk made from the tusk of
	a monster.
Sancho
	Ees no esurprising eef eet has the especial
	powers, eh?
Tuppence
	You don't think it can improve your handwriting,
	do you?
Tuppence
	No, I... I suppose not. Oh, well.
Bianca
	I wonder when anyone'd want to play an instrument like that. I certainly don't want to hear it!
Nera
	The sound of people screaming?
	Brrr... It sends shivers down your spine.
%0%a001240
	It doesn't sound like a very nice instrument, does it?
%0%a001250
	Tell me if you're going to use it, won't you, Dad?
	So I can put my fingers in my ears.
Sancho
	Thees señor, he pretends he no escared, but your Uncle Sancho knows the truth. He can no hide the esweat on hees brow.
Tuppence
	But surely no one wants to listen to the sound of people screaming. I know I don't.
Bianca
	Seein' that locket makes me feel all choked up inside.
Nera
	It's a shame for such a beautiful locket not to have a picture in it. It seems so sad.
%0%a001240
	I wonder what kind of things Grandpa and Grandma could tell us about this locket.
%0%a001250
	I can feel Grandma's loving warmth in that locket.
%0%a001250
	I, I don't know why. I just can.
Sancho
	Eet, eet was esuch a happy time...
	Señor Pankraz and señora Mada, they were eso een love... (sob)
Tuppence
	That man was at King Pankraz's wedding?
	Now that's got to be a lie!
Bianca
	That's your mum, en't it, %a000090?
	She's got such a kind-lookin' face.
Bianca
	It's easy to see how Pankraz fell in love with her at first sight.
Nera
	You can tell from the portrait what a kind and pure woman she was.
%0%a001240
	He's crying! He must've been really moved.
%0%a001250
	So that's what Grandma looked like when she
	was young.
Sancho
	Ees eso good to have thees picture een the
	locket at last. Señor Pankraz, he would be eso...eso happy.
Tuppence
	The chap's crying now. I can't keep up with him.
	Just who is he exactly?
Bianca
	You'd have to be pretty keen on souvenirs to go to that extreme to get 'em, eh?
Nera
	Don't you think we should warn him about how scary it is in Nadiria?
%0%a001240
	You can't just get a trophy like that by living in Nadiria, though. You have to defeat Estark.
%0%a001250
	He's not serious, is he? No, he can't be...
Sancho
	Uf! He would no esay thees eef he goes there!
Tuppence
	Whatever the reasons, just entertaining the idea
	of getting Nadirian citizenship is pretty terrifying really!
Bianca
	It must be quite reassurin' for the customers, seein' we've got the security of the place covered.
Nera
	Well that's reassuring, isn't it?
%0%a001240
	Nothing to report! Heh heh! That sounds cool!
%0%a001250
	He keeps an eye on the knick-knackatory even when we're not here, doesn't he?
Sancho
	I hope to the Goddess there are no problems here. But you know, esometimes the bad theengs, they come for us all.
Tuppence
	Is it okay just to have a guard on the entrance?
	I'd be a bit worried about that, I think.
Bianca
	He dun't need to be frettin' about us. We're havin' fun with things just the way they are.
Nera
	That's nice, isn't it? I think he's starting to like us!
%0%a001240
	Cool! Is that your salary, Dad?
	Because you're the curator, I mean.
%0%a001250
	He gave you that because you're trying so hard, didn't he, Dad? I think you're doing really well too.
Sancho
	Ees no normal to esee the museum at night, eh?
Sancho
	Ees because you are the curator now, friend.
	Sí, ees thanks to you. Gracias, gracias.
Tuppence
	Five hundred gold coins? That's it!?
	He's a slave-driver if you ask me, %a000090!
	
Bianca
	I wasn't plannin' on complainin' though, were you?
Nera
	He's very strict, isn't he?
	But it's probably for our own good, I expect.
%0%a001240
	Just when I thought he was getting a bit nicer,
	he goes back to being Mr Grumpy.
%0%a001250
	Come on, Dad. Let's find loads more knick-knacks and really surprise the old man.
Sancho
	Ees no normal to esee the museum at night, eh?
Sancho
	Ees because you are the curator now, friend.
	Sí, ees thanks to you. Gracias, gracias.
Tuppence
	But only five hundred? That's daylight robbery.
	It's less than my salary, even.
Bianca
	He dun't need to be frettin' about us. We're havin' fun with things just the way they are.
Nera
	I'm sure the place will look amazing no matter how you arrange the exhibits. You're so good at it.
%0%a001240
	Cool! Is that your salary, Dad?
	Because you're the curator, I mean.
%0%a001250
	Maybe we should try changing some of the exhibits around. There's quite a lot to running a knick-knackatory, isn't there?
Sancho
	Now the aficionados, the experts of the
	knick-knacks, they gonna come to esee
	your collection, friend.
Tuppence
	A thousand gold coins? That's it!?
	He's a slave-driver if you ask me, %a000090!
	
Bianca
	I s'pose we should just take it that he really likes
	the place.
Nera
	Do you think he wants to see how the place is run? What's he going to do about dinner? And having a shower in the morning?
%0%a001240
	He spent the whole day looking at the exhibits?
	I knew it. He's definitely a bit weird.
%0%a001250
	We can't throw him out, so what are we going to do?
Sancho
	But eef thees señor, he estays the night here, hees family, they gonna worry about heem, sí?
Tuppence
	Well, I can understand how he feels.
	It's nice and quiet here, and the view's fantastic.
Bianca
	He sounds a bit tired. We should let him get
	some sleep.
Nera
	I suppose Old Man Nick's been cleaning on his own when we're not here.
Nera
	Poor man. He must be exhausted.
%0%a001240
	So ghosts sleep too? That's funny.
%0%a001250
	I hope he isn't lonely, all on his own.
Sancho
	You no wake heem up, okay, friend?
	He ees very tired.
Tuppence
	There, there are no other ghosts about other than Old Man Nick Knack, are there?
Tuppence
	I don't think it's a good idea to spend the night here, you know. No, definitely not a good idea.
Bianca
	I wonder what he's dreamin' about.
Nera
	He's still comparing, even when he's asleep!
%0%a001240
	Wow! He can really snore. The whole room's shaking!
%0%a001250
	Isn't he scared, sleeping in a place like this all on
	his own?
Sancho
	He no estay the night here because he loves the knick-knacks, eh? No, no. Ees no because
	of thees.
Tuppence
	It doesn't look like he's intending to leave any time soon, does it? Pity...
Bianca
	One single buildin' on one tiny island...
	And yet it's a great big knick-knackatory!
