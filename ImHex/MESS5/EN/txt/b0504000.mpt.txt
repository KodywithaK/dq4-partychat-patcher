Bianca
	We stayed here one night when we were
	movin' to Stockenbarrel.
Bianca
	It's a bit simple, but they gave us such a warm welcome. It was just what Dad needed to cheer
	him up after givin' up the inn.
Bianca
	Folk goin' to Mostroferrato for trade and the like usually spend a night here on the way.
Nera
	We stayed here one night on the way home to Mostroferrato from the abbey.
Nera
	I knew that I'd be forced into marrying someone who wasn't of my choosing when I got home.
Nera
	And yet, I didn't feel uneasy at all. It's as if I was being guided by a bright light, and I had no fear
	of what was in store.
Bianca
	Timin' might be important, but it en't everythin'.
	You need lots of energy too.
Nera
	He he he! What a funny little ditty! Just what you need to put a smile on your face.
Bianca
	%0%a001210 was a sabrecat and not just a regular cat, eh?
Bianca
	You dun't think the sabrecat that bloke was just on about could be...?
Nera
	Someone's pet!? Surely you're the only one brave enough to keep a monster as a pet, %a000090!
Bianca
	I wonder what kind of gossip it is.
	We should have a look!
Nera
	Gossip isn't usually a good thing. But... I wouldn't mind having a look to see what it's about.
Bianca
	It's probably all just much of a muchness, but it can't hurt to take it with.
Nera
	I looked all the way through, but I couldn't see anything in there about us. Shame, really.
Bianca
	I remember Dad sayin' somethin' along the same lines. Family's ever so important to him.
Nera
	Darling... Um, never mind. I was just thinking how happy I am, that's all.
Bianca
	En't those sons of hers the priest and the bloke from the inn?
Bianca
	I wonder when she had them! She dun't look old enough to have kids that big!
Nera
	Would you prefer to have a boy or a girl? No doubt you want a boy to follow in your footsteps?
Nera
	Yes, they're so rough and tumble. It's fun to watch them play. I'll pray that we have a boy.
Nera
	But girls can be so delicate. Wouldn't you just be worried about her all the time?
Nera
	He he he! Very well, I'll do my best to give you a girl!
Bianca
	Crikey! That took me by surprise! I remember the cat at our place bein' like that at first.
Nera
	Oh dear! That cat seems to be in rather a bad mood. I suppose we all have days like that.
Debora
	I stayed here once before on the way home from collecting Nera from the abbey.
Debora
	There was a nun travelling with us too. We sang some lovely songs and even danced a bit.
Debora
	But that nun just sat there in the corner, silent as a lamb. Some people just have no sense of fun.
Debora
	Given your good timing with marrying me, that must mean you're not bad when it comes to wielding an axe.
Debora
	Taming a husband is one thing, but taming a monster is quite another.
Debora
	You'd probably be able to do it, though, wouldn't you? I don't know how we're supposed to remind it of its old owner, mind you.
Debora
	Gossip is a stupid waste of time. The silly rumours about me back home just meant no one really knew the truth.
Debora
	Hey! Why is there nothing about me in here?
Debora
	When we have children, I want to just let them do as they please. I only need one servant, and that's you, %a000090.
Debora
	For goodness' sake, %a000090!
	You can tame monsters, but you can't pet a cat without getting into a fight!?
Debora
	That innkeeper could tell we were a happily married couple, even though he doesn't know us.
Debora
	It's great that you seem nice and happy being my slave. It means you'll stay devoted to me for evermore.
