Bianca
	We dun't really have time to be larkin' about...and yet here we are again, eh?
Nera
	Are you sure we should really be here, darling?
	I don't know that we have time for this kind of thing.
%0%a001240
	Thanks for bringing us here, Dad! Do you think they have a slurpodrome?
%0%a001250
	Sancho never brought us here.
Sancho
	Your Uncle Sancho, he has never heard about esuch a place like thees!
Tuppence
	Yippee! There are more bunny girls here than I could shake a stick at!
Bianca
	I hope he gets his wish and manages to save a bit
	of cash.
Nera
	It's a shame to see him so despondent. This place is supposed to be for having fun.
%0%a001250
	His clothes are so shabby. I feel really sorry for him.
Tuppence
	You mustn't talk to people like that! We'll all end
	up being tarred with the same brush if we're
	not careful.
Bianca
	Well, if we're goin' in, then let's get movin'.
Nera
	Mind how you go when you step onto the pontoon, won't you, darling?
%0%a001240
	What a cool way to get aboard!
%0%a001250
	So we have to get on that little boat first, and then we get on the big one?
Sancho
	I no like the esmall boats. You can no trust a boat eef ees esmaller than a galleon.
Tuppence
	I wonder if this rather convoluted way of entering and exiting the place is so that no one can run off before time with their winnings.
Bianca
	I wonder if he's just plannin' on stayin' there lookin' longingly at the place, then.
Nera
	If you don't put up with a little discomfort sometimes, you can miss out on a lot of fun.
%0%a001240
	But how did he get here in the first place?
	This is an island, right!?
Sancho
	Esome people, they no like the motion of the esea. You are lucky, eh, friend? You no feel eet.
Tuppence
	Ha ha ha, what a coward! It looks like we'll have to take his share of the winnings, then!
Bianca
	Oh dear. Sounds like she's pretty disappointed, eh?
Nera
	But it's nice and peaceful by the water's edge. They'd probably enjoy a nice swim together.
%0%a001240
	So they've come all this way just to look at the boat?
%0%a001240
	I suppose it is a pretty cool boat. I'd probably be happy to just sit and look at it all day long.
Tuppence
	Courting a lady can cost quite a lot of money.
Tuppence
	Hopefully I'll be able to find myself one who takes pleasure in the smaller things in life.
Bianca
	What a huge ship! It's much bigger than the boat Briscoletti give us, eh?
Nera
	I'm not very familiar with the layout of the ship, either. So we can explore it together.
%0%a001240
	It really is a huge ship, isn't it!?
%0%a001240
	Mr Briscoletti sounds pretty amazing.
Tuppence
	Yes, I'd hope to own at least one boat of my own in the future.
Bianca
	Urgh! What a disgusting old man!
Nera
	On Papa's ship, of all places!
%0%a001240
	Yuck! He can't throw up here, can he!?
%0%a001250
	Dad! Let's get away from him!
Sancho
	Eef you make a mess like thees, you must
	clean eet yourself. You know thees, sí, friend?
Tuppence
	We have an emergency situation! Man vomiting! Evacuate the area!
Bianca
	Briscoletti must be pretty loaded to be able to employ someone like him all the way out here, eh?
Nera
	Casinos do have a tendency to get rather wild. It's important to make sure the customers are safe.
%0%a001240
	ⓗOut of handⓘ? Why would people get out of hand when they're just here to gamble?
Sancho
	Señor Briscoletti, he theenks muchos about
	hees clientes.
Sancho
	Sí, ees the mark of a fine man, you know.
Bianca
	Well, now that we're here, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to play a game or three.
Nera
	I'm afraid I'm too preoccupied with worry about Grandmaster Nimzo. I'm not sure I'd be able to
	have any fun.
%0%a001240
	No problem! I could spend all the time in the
	world here!
Bianca
	A weddin' on a boat, eh? Still, our weddin' was nicer than anyone's, I reckon!
%0%a001240
	But you didn't get married here, did you? Does that mean we won't be happy?
Nera
	I think we were the first couple to be married here. And I know we're going to be really happy.
%0%a001250
	Ooh! Is this where you and Mum got married?
%0%a001250
	Then I'm going to get married here too!
Sancho
	Qué!? You were married here, friend?
Sancho
	I, I weesh I was here to esee eet, friend. You must have been eso, eso handsome!
Tuppence
	It must be a logistical nightmare trying to ferry all your wedding guests out here.
Tuppence
	What's wrong, %a000090? Have I said something to upset you?
Bianca
	I s'pose sailors have to work shifts so there's always someone on duty at any time of day.
	Looks like pretty hard work.
Nera
	Oops! Looks like we've invaded the sailors' quarters.
%0%a001240
	Um, what's the difference between having a nap and having a sleep? Is it that naps are always during the day?
Sancho
	Ees esuch a beeg, grand room.
	But ees just for the esailors, sí?
Bianca
	Yeah, if only we could get in the kind of wins we expected, eh?
Nera
	Papa did something to the slot machines because he says it's boring if casinos pay out too predictably.
%0%a001240
	I hate maths! None of my answers are ever
	right either!
%0%a001250
	I wonder what kind of calculations he's making.
	It'd be interesting to find out.
Tuppence
	Real men shouldn't be bothering themselves with meaningless calculations like that!
Bianca
	Yeah, you'll have to make sure you dun't get too carried away, eh? Still, I'm here lookin' over your shoulder, so you should be okay.
Nera
	I wonder which one of them is her husband.
Sancho
	I tell you thees already, no, friend?
	You no do anytheeng too much, okay? But no the paella. Ees never too much for the paella.
Bianca
	D'you think he'd really be havin' fun if he lost, then?
Nera
	That's exactly right. It's probably a good idea to
	find something to do that will lift your spirits
	when you lose.
%0%a001240
	ⓗAll good funⓘ?
%0%a001240
	I can't imagine it'd be that much fun if you lost all your money, but still.
%0%a001250
	Um, Dad. Do we have time right now to be
	having fun?
Sancho
	Eef you want to play, you play, friend.
	But eef you want to go, we go now, okay?
Bianca
	I s'pose the place does need a captain, bein' a boat and all.
Nera
	He really doesn't take no for an answer. It can be quite embarrassing at times.
Bianca
	That is pretty impressive, but you've bin through at least ten times that many fights, eh, %a000090?
Nera
	............
Nera
	I think you're much more accomplished than that.
%0%a001240
	We're just as good as him! Right, Dad?
Bianca
	Oh, right. People like to come here so they can feel like they're on a cruise or somethin', do they?
Nera
	Hopefully it won't be too long before people can enjoy proper sea voyages again without having to fear for their safety.
%0%a001240
	But proper sea voyages and being on the casino ship are totally different! Or don't people care?
Sancho
	Sí. The world, ees a very dangerous place now.
Bianca
	Blimey! You wouldn't have thought they'd have rooms this grand on a ship, eh, %a000090?
Nera
	I've come to like the sea since we started our journey together, %a000090. It's wonderful to look at the stars from onboard a ship.
%0%a001250
	Now I feel all hungry!
Tuppence
	Listen to her! A burden!? We're the ones with
	the burden, having the fate of the world on
	our shoulders!
Tuppence
	How irritating!
Nera
	He he he! It was like sleeping in a big rocking cradle last night, wasn't it, darling?
%0%a001250
	The bed was so soft!
Tuppence
	You can't fault the accommodation or the food.
	We should stay here again!
Bianca
	That was the best night's sleep I've had in ages.
	You were out for the count as well, %a000090.
%0%a001250
	The bed was so soft!
Tuppence
	You can't fault the accommodation or the food.
	We should stay here again!
Bianca
	Maybe I should give it a go, eh?
Bianca
	Ha ha! Only jokin'!
Nera
	If only I had the courage to dance in front of people like they do.
%0%a001240
	Woo hoo! One, two, three, and one!
Bianca
	You can see right up everyone's nostrils when they crane their necks up at the stage like that. Yuck!
Nera
	The dance is thrilling, indeed, but I think the outfits might be even more so!
Tuppence
	It is rather thrilling, I admit. It could be even more so if she'd only move her feet a bit faster.
Bianca
	What a dance! If any bloke fancied a closer look at the footwork, she'd knock him for six, no trouble!
Nera
	I wouldn't get too close if I were you, otherwise you might get kicked too.
%0%a001250
	It's really clever how they all move in time together like that.
Tuppence
	I don't mind being kicked! I'm willing to take that risk if I can get a closer view.
Bianca
	Maybe I should get a job here if ever we run out of money then, eh?
Nera
	It's a terrible thing that young girls have to do work like this just for the money.
Nera
	But with Papa running the place, I'm sure it's a lot more highbrow than other establishments.
%0%a001240
	So they get paid a lot of money? Maybe I should try getting a job here!
Tuppence
	Oh! If only I were rich! Then I could pay them to dance for me and me alone.
Bianca
	I wonder if that's what happens to you if you end up doin' that kind of job too long.
Nera
	People say that women become more beautiful if they're looked at with appreciation. It makes me
	feel all embarrassed, though.
%0%a001250
	She doesn't look like she minds really. Can I be a dancing girl when I grow up?
Sancho
	Anda! Thees señorita, eshe ees fiery like the jalapeño, eh?
Tuppence
	You can tell she's enjoying it really. We should stare at her too!
Bianca
	Do you reckon she's new here? She seems a bit unsure of herself.
Nera
	One, two... One and two...
Nera
	I can have a little go at dancing here because no one can really see me.
Sancho
	Ees, ees getting hot een here, no?
	All these young señoritas, they, they...
	Anda!
Tuppence
	It would be nice if we had at least one of these dancing girls at home at our inn. It would certainly liven the place up a bit.
Bianca
	All these dancin' girls make themselves up the same way, so it's hard to tell 'em apart!
Nera
	Oh! I think that girl was at the abbey when I was!
	No, I must be imagining it.
%0%a001240
	Everyone works really hard here. We should make sure we do the same.
Tuppence
	Hm? It seems one of them isn't quite as young as
	the others.
Bianca
	Have you got a bit of a thing for her feet
	or somethin'!?
Bianca
	Huh! If it's trouble you're after, I'll give you plenty if you're not careful!
Bianca
	Hmmm...
	Are you sure about that?
Nera
	Darling...
	Did you tread on that girl's foot?
Nera
	How rude!
Nera
	Good. I'm not sure I'd like to be married to the kind of man who goes around treading on people's toes.
%0%a001250
	It's really hot up on stage.
Bianca
	I get it. But I'm not sure he'll catch any cheats standin' there.
Nera
	Does that mean you can cheat at the casino, then?
Nera
	Hmm, I've no idea how.
%0%a001240
	He was looking the other way just now, though. Do you think he really is on some kind of watch? I'm not so sure.
Sancho
	You no get een thees señor's way, okay?
	He ees working.
Bianca
	If he reckons he knows so much, why dun't he get up an' have a go then, eh?
Nera
	That man was rather opinionated, wasn't he? It sounded as if he knew what he was talking about, though.
%0%a001240
	What a strange man!
%0%a001250
	He doesn't look like much of a dance expert to me.
Tuppence
	Pah! I'd like to see him do a better job of the dance!
Bianca
	Ha ha! I wish I could've seen him get hit, that would've bin funny!
Nera
	Knocked off the stage? Goodness, those dancers must be tougher than they look!
%0%a001250
	Well, he shouldn't have tried to get up on the stage, the silly man.
Tuppence
	What a fool! He should've stayed where he was.
Bianca
	Old Briscoletti is full of surprises, eh?
Nera
	Papa donated some money to the abbey I stayed
	at too.
Nera
	But I asked Abbess Abovall to treat me just like everyone else regardless, which was nice.
%0%a001240
	Have you ever made a donation, Dad?
	I haven't made any yet.
Tuppence
	I don't suppose anyone would fancy donating something to me, would they?
Bianca
	He seems a bit shook up, eh? It can be a bit of a blow when you lose, I s'pose.
Nera
	Papa often used to say it's a good idea to pray to the Goddess before you end up losing too much.
%0%a001240
	That old man was disappointed, wasn't he? People always look down when they're disappointed.
Sancho
	You esee? You can no tell what ees gonna
	happen when you gamble.
Bianca
	Yeah, I'll bet. He certainly en't gettin' his money together by defeatin' monsters.
Nera
	Yes, well, I've never really thought about that before. I wonder how everyone's getting on.
%0%a001240
	You don't think they all got their money by doing things they shouldn't have, do you?
Sancho
	The best way ees to work hard and earn the garbanzos like an honest man.
Tuppence
	Yes, I wouldn't mind being party to that kind of knowledge myself.
Bianca
	Typical! There's all them desperate, greedy people
	out there, and then someone like her comes along
	and wins!
Nera
	She's lucky that she won without even trying. I just hope she doesn't end up addicted as a result. That wouldn't be so lucky.
%0%a001250
	Sounds like she had a win. Good for her!
Tuppence
	But that's a win!
Tuppence
	...Oh dear! She's not listening at all.
Bianca
	Gettin' wound up like that en't goin' to help,
	though, eh?
Nera
	People really must try to just treat casinos as places of fun. It doesn't do to become so upset
	by them.
%0%a001240
	Is the casino here broken, then?
%0%a001250
	She was really noisy. Why can't she just be quiet and let everyone carry on having fun?
Tuppence
	Dear me! What a frightening specimen of a woman! Now there's one lady I wouldn't be marrying in
	a hurry.
Bianca
	Yeah, but ten thousand can turn into a hundred,
	and a hundred can turn into one too. It works
	both ways.
Nera
	We'll have to keep steadily building up our tokens, just like he said.
%0%a001240
	I get it. That's pretty useful advice.
Tuppence
	One token? I'd rather start with at least a hundred.
Bianca
	That's the first time I've seen a priest in a casino!
	I wonder if the Goddess'll answer his prayers.
Nera
	Surely it's not the done thing to waste a prayer
	to the Goddess on such a thing! I certainly wouldn't do it.
%0%a001250
	The Goddess might punish him for using prayer
	like that.
Tuppence
	What a good idea! Maybe I should've become a priest and then paid a visit here.
Bianca
	I know I probably dun't need to say this, but dun't get too carried away here, eh? Let's just let off a bit of steam, that's all.
Nera
	Where do we start? I quite like going for Double or Nothing at the poker table myself.
%0%a001240
	This place is massive! You'd never think they could fit all this on a boat.
%0%a001250
	Casinos are always a bit noisy, aren't they?
Sancho
	I no tell you you can no play.
	But you must no forget our quest, okay?
Tuppence
	Right, then! Time for Tuppence to get busy!
Bianca
	That was a stroke of luck! I wonder why no one else spotted it, though. It's so shiny that it's pretty hard to miss.
Nera
	How fortunate! Maybe we're having a bit of a
	lucky streak.
%0%a001240
	That was lucky!
Tuppence
	Ooh... Do you think there's just the one?
Bianca
	Dun't look like they've got any of the special Zoomshine, though, eh? Life is but a drink...ha ha ha!
Nera
	Oh yes! These are all Papa's favourite drinks!
%0%a001250
	Do you think there are drinks in those barrels and wooden boxes too? Yuck! It stinks!
Sancho
	Jumping jalapeños! They even have your
	papá's favourite!
Tuppence
	Drink is of no interest to me, I'm afraid.
Bianca
	They've even got a T 'n' T board! This ship's just one big fun palace, eh?
Nera
	You're probably surprised to see a T 'n' T board here, right? I know I am!
%0%a001240
	Whoopee! It's T 'n' T! It's T 'n' T!
%0%a001250
	This T 'n' T board looks easy enough...maybe.
Tuppence
	Ooh! A T 'n' T board! I'm rather a whizz at T 'n' T, even if I do say so myself.
Bianca
	Yeah, you can never get as far as you think you can. It's a tricky old game.
Nera
	Yes, you have to keep checking your position and figuring out the best route forward. It's not easy.
%0%a001240
	It's no fun if you take it that seriously. Can't we just play the game and see what happens?
Bianca
	I dun't remember the ship rockin' all that much,
	do you?
Nera
	There were probably times when the boat rocking worked in his favour as well, though.
Sancho
	You can no esay anytheeng, eh?
Tuppence
	I'd use the boat's rocking to my advantage if it
	were me!
Bianca
	Yeah, it's a pity you can't just buy yourself a
	ticket, eh?
Nera
	That reminds me. I heard once about a T 'n' T free pass that lets you play as many times as you like.
%0%a001240
	Wiz pips and conkjurers?
	We should look out for them.
Sancho
	We must no forget thees advice, okay?
	You put eet een your head, and you
	keep eet esafe.
Bianca
	Nope. I could never just laze about havin' fun if there were things to be won.
Nera
	I don't think I think too much.
	So I win some and I lose some.
%0%a001240
	Don't think too much? Sounds good to me!
Tuppence
	Not using my head? I should think I could easily manage that!
Tuppence
	...I say, %a000090! I was rather hoping you'd disagree there.
Bianca
	So this is where the casino prizes are kept? Ooh! Gimme, gimme, gimme!
Bianca
	Yeah!
Bianca
	Oh.
Nera
	It looks like I'd be in a lot of trouble if I messed with anything here, no matter that I'm a Briscoletti myself!
%0%a001240
	Wow! Look at all this stuff. The people here have loads more luggage than we do.
Tuppence
	Pah! It's impossible to tell just from looking which things are the most valuable.
Bianca
	There's certainly a lot of gear in here. Looks like everyone must've come to stay for a while, eh?
Nera
	It's as if people are planning on staying as long as it takes to have a big win, don't you think?
%0%a001240
	Some of the stuff is what people have won here, isn't it? They're so lucky!
Sancho
	You must no look at the luggages eso much, friend. People are gonna theenk you want to esteal esometheeng.
Bianca
	He may not go off playin' in the casino, but surely sleepin' on the job is just as bad!
Nera
	Sailors like him have people's lives in their hands, so you'd really hope for a little more care to be taken.
%0%a001240
	Who do you suppose he thought he was talking to?
%0%a001250
	If he must sleep, it's a shame he can't do it
	more quietly.
Tuppence
	He's got sleeping while pretending to be awake down to a fine art, that one. It's a little trick I use myself sometimes, I must admit.
Bianca
	I s'pose it would be pretty nice gettin' married
	here, but it'd be tricky to get your guests to come
	all this way.
Nera
	I was only ever allowed in my own room and out on deck when I rode on ships with Papa.
Nera
	I had no idea that he felt so strongly
	about it, though.
Bianca
	That's a fair old load of cookin' utensils there, eh? You could make anythin' you liked with them.
Nera
	Mmm, what a lovely smell! I'm starting to feel a bit hungry now.
%0%a001240
	Now I'm hungry!
%0%a001250
	Mmm. Something smells absolutely delicious.
Bianca
	We dun't really have time to be larkin' about...and yet here we are again, eh?
Nera
	Are you sure we should really be here, darling?
	I don't know that we have time for this kind of thing.
%0%a001240
	Thanks for bringing us here, Dad! Do you think they have a slurpodrome?
%0%a001250
	Sancho never brought us here.
Sancho
	Your Uncle Sancho, he has never heard about esuch a place like thees!
Tuppence
	The place feels a little bit lonely at night.
Bianca
	Well, if we're goin' in, then let's get movin'.
Nera
	Mind how you go when you step onto the pontoon, won't you, darling?
%0%a001240
	What a cool way to get aboard!
%0%a001250
	So we have to get on that little boat first, and then we get on the big one?
Tuppence
	I wonder if this rather convoluted way of entering and exiting the place is so that no one can run off before time with their winnings.
Bianca
	Maybe I should make a wish too! I wish that my family will never be separated again.
Nera
	Wishing upon a star isn't going to rid the
	world of Grandmaster Nimzo. No, we have
	to do that ourselves.
%0%a001250
	Oh yes! Look how pretty the stars are!
Tuppence
	I've wished upon stars dozens of times, and not once has my wish come true!
Bianca
	En't it a bit sad drinkin' on your own like that?
Nera
	Well, we're enjoying a nice walk under the stars, aren't we, darling?
%0%a001250
	(yawn) I've come over all sleepy all of a sudden.
Tuppence
	It's alright for some! Here we are, struggling away with our quest, while the likes of her swan about drinking champagne!
Bianca
	So they dun't sail this ship no more, eh?
Nera
	How sweet! It must take a lot of dedication to become a ship's captain.
%0%a001240
	What sort of things do you think he writes?
	I wouldn't mind having a read.
Bianca
	Blimey! It's all go for him whether he's awake or asleep, eh?
Nera
	He must be a keen gambler to be fretting about it in his sleep!
%0%a001250
	It's like he's fighting even in his sleep.
Tuppence
	I should imagine he'll wake up with terrible backache, sleeping like that.
Bianca
	He's in a bit of a state, eh?
Nera
	That poor man! He seems rather disturbed.
%0%a001240
	That must be a funny-looking dance, then!
Sancho
	Sí, sí... The lovely dance...
	Qué!? No, friend. Your Uncle Sancho respects the dancers. You eshould too...
Bianca
	Fair enough. A walk outside in the fresh air would cheer me up just as well, though.
Nera
	Maybe we should have a little dance whenever we lose, then?
Sancho
	Thees señorita, eshe ees happy now! The people on the Ventuno, they are no like the normal gamblers.
Tuppence
	The best thing to do when you lose is to curl up in a blanket and go to bed. And have a little cry while you're at it.
Bianca
	Brrr. His eyes are really scary.
Nera
	People can get far too wound up by the whole
	casino experience. It should just be about having
	a bit of fun.
%0%a001250
	Why was he glaring at us like that?
	It's not our fault he lost.
Bianca
	What a funny old man! I hope he dun't hurt himself with that kind of carry on!
Nera
	He he he! He obviously doesn't like to be beaten,
	does he?
%0%a001240
	Do you think he's okay? I could hear his hip cracking from here!
Bianca
	Yeah. I wonder why the sea air makes everythin'
	so sticky.
Nera
	Yes, she seems a sticky character, that's for sure. Sorry... I was just making a joke.
%0%a001250
	My hair's probably all sticky too. Maybe I'd better have a bath tonight.
Tuppence
	I don't mind one bit if her hair's all sticky. Nope, a bunny girl in any state is good enough for me!
Bianca
	It's hard work tryin' to sleep durin' the day.
	I much prefer sleepin' of a night.
Nera
	He seems a reliable sort.
	I'm sure the ship's safe in his hands.
%0%a001240
	There are so many rooms on this ship! I keep thinking we're going to get lost.
Bianca
	He en't got a bad voice, but I dun't have a clue what them lyrics are all about.
Nera
	What a voice! He certainly knows how to command everyone's attention.
%0%a001240
	What's that song supposed to be about?
	I don't get it.
%0%a001250
	That singer's really, really handsome...
Tuppence
	I'm not the slightest bit interested in hearing a man sing, I'm afraid.
Bianca
	What a weird man! What do you suppose his story
	is, eh?
Nera
	There are all sorts of people in the world,
	aren't there?
%0%a001240
	It rips your heart out? Really!?
Tuppence
	............
Tuppence
	Forgive me, but I have nothing to say on the matter.
Bianca
	He may not look the part, but it's his job to be on the lookout for cheats, eh?
Nera
	The atmosphere certainly is relaxed. It's rather romantic, in fact...
%0%a001240
	Is he hunting out cheats, then? That's cool!
%0%a001250
	Oh dear... I don't think I can stay awake much
	longer. Sorry.
Tuppence
	I would never have thought from his appearance that he was out to catch cheats. I'll have to watch out for that in future.
Bianca
	I think we'd prob'ly better leave him be.
Nera
	There can only be one reason for being miserable in a place like this. He's obviously lost all his money and can't afford to travel home.
%0%a001240
	What's wrong with him, Dad?
	Why's he so upset?
Sancho
	You leave heem alone, okay?
	Like he asks.
Bianca
	I like them both the same. The dancin' is fun to watch, and the music is nice and relaxin' to listen to.
Nera
	I prefer the singing, personally. That man is especially good, don't you think?
%0%a001240
	I feel a bit sleepy. Listening to that man's singing
	is having the same kind of effect as listening to
	a lullaby.
Tuppence
	Dance, dance, dance! It's definitely the dance that's the best bit! Didn't he see all those young girls!?
Bianca
	I didn't know priests gambled. He seems a bit hooked, actually. Do you think that's okay?
Nera
	I suppose priests are people too. It can't hurt for him to have a little bit of fun.
Bianca
	The idea of a floatin' casino is all well and good, but it's a bit of a pain for people to get to.
Nera
	This is a lovely spot. And the island's nice too, with its lovely crescent shape. Just like a new moon!
%0%a001240
	I wonder how long ago that was. Do you think it was even before I was born?
Sancho
	Sí. Ees too dangerous now for esailing.
Bianca
	There's no point hangin' around a T 'n' T board if you en't got no T 'n' T tickets.
Nera
	Oh dear. He won't be able to play any more, then.
%0%a001240
	Conkjurers, eh?
	We'll have to remember that.
%0%a001250
	Oh no! He's not going to go off bullying a poor conkjurer just to get a T 'n' T ticket, is he?
Bianca
	I can think of better ways to go down in history, thank you very much!
Nera
	Don't worry. The sea around here isn't very deep, so there's nothing for us to sink in.
%0%a001250
	We're not going to sink!
	This boat is perfectly safe!
Tuppence
	I do wish people wouldn't say things like that.
	One wouldn't want to be jinxed.
Bianca
	What a poor excuse for a sailor!
	...We won't sink, will we!?
Nera
	I can't swim either. You'll have to rescue me if it ever comes to it, okay?
%0%a001240
	I can swim, you know, Dad. So if we ever do sink or anything, you should save %a001250, not me.
%0%a001250
	I know, %a001240...
Sancho
	Sí. Eso do I! I no like thees conversation!
Bianca
	Fancy sayin' that in his sleep! He really is a shirker!
Nera
	I'm afraid that chap's likely to lose his job before long if he's not careful.
%0%a001240
	It sounds like he's often ⓗshirkingⓘ to me.
Bianca
	Now that's dedication, dreamin' about cookin' even in your sleep!
Nera
	I find cooking really good fun. It's always so exciting to see how things turn out.
%0%a001250
	The cook's asleep. Does that mean there won't be any more food today?
Debora
	Are you sure we have time to be hanging
	around here?
Debora
	He should do something about his appearance at the very least. The likes of him don't fit in on the Ventuno.
Debora
	You usually have to make a reservation to get on the pontoon, but they're letting you on because you're with me.
Debora
	What's the point in coming to a casino ship if you're no good on the water?
Debora
	I wouldn't just stand there staring out to sea if I was her. I'd be heading home like a shot.
Debora
	Papa's not here today, so we can really go to town and have some fun!
Debora
	Remember this is Papa's boat, so if you make a mess, you clean it up.
Debora
	Everyone that comes here is really rich, so it would be bad news if anything untoward happened.
Debora
	I know there are things we need to do, but it couldn't hurt to put them out of our minds just for now.
Debora
	Indeed. Except your promise to me was more one of eternal devotion than love.
Debora
	What have you brought me to this filthy hole for? We're supposed to be here to have fun.
Debora
	I remember Papa saying he'd fixed it so the payouts wouldn't be predictable.
Debora
	I'll never tell you that you can't visit a casino.
Debora
	I will tell you that you have to take me with you, though!
Debora
	Good fun? There's nothing fun about being a loser.
Debora
	Yep, once Papa makes his mind up about something, there's absolutely no changing it.
Debora
	Only five? That's hardly worth boasting about.
Debora
	I suppose you could imagine you're on a cruise here.
Debora
	It'd soon be a bit dull, though, what with the view never changing.
Debora
	There wouldn't be anything elegant about it if she ate too much and then felt seasick!
Debora
	That bed was so comfortable!
	Trust Papa to get it just right.
Debora
	Can I keep up? Ha! I could give her a run for her money if I wanted to.
Debora
	Er, %a000090! What are you staring at?
Debora
	She must be really into her dancing.
Debora
	I wonder just how much Papa is paying these girls.
Debora
	I don't blame her. I always find it really irritating when men make it so obvious they can't take their eyes off me.
Debora
	She's obviously new. She's totally out of synch with the other girls.
Debora
	All of these dancing girls wear such heavy make-up.
Debora
	I suppose it's because they don't have the natural beauty I have.
Debora
	You didn't tread on that girl's foot then, did you?
Debora
	Tsk! You're a disgrace.
	I can't take you anywhere.
Debora
	I wonder... Wimp that you are, you always go red when you tell a lie, so it's a bit of a giveaway.
Debora
	If he's supposed to be on the lookout for cheats, then what's he been doing staring at the stage all
	the time?
Debora
	I hardly think he's in a position to pass judgement on the dancing! I'm sure they can dance a lot better than he can.
Debora
	Serves him right! What kind of idiot tries to jump up on the stage when the girls are busy dancing?
Debora
	I never knew Papa did that.
Debora
	Quick, let's get away from him!
	Bad luck can be catching, you know.
Debora
	Yes, no matter how many times I ask Papa why he's so rich he won't tell me.
Debora
	So she managed to win even though she doesn't know how to play? Some people have all the luck.
Debora
	Stupid woman! Fancy blaming her own bad luck on the slot machines!
Debora
	Don't you go being stingy over each and every coin, will you? You have to spend money to make money!
Debora
	I wouldn't mind worshipping the Goddess if she granted prayers like winning at the casino!
Debora
	What shall we start with? I like going for broke on the poker table myself.
Debora
	It seems a bit desperate, picking up tokens from the floor like that.
Debora
	It's true. I've seen Papa drinking all of these.
Debora
	I can't believe Papa even built a T 'n' T board here!
Debora
	It's better just to go for it and see what happens rather than trying to plan a route. You never know your luck!
Debora
	We'd better watch out for that when we're rolling too.
Debora
	I wonder who makes T 'n' T tickets anyway.
	Do you think it's conkjurers?
Debora
	Precisely! It's better just to go with your gut.
	That's the way to win, if you ask me.
Debora
	As if I would! How dare he insinuate such a thing!
Debora
	It looks like some people have moved here permanently, what with all this luggage.
Debora
	He's got some nerve slacking off from his work so blatantly right in front of me!
Debora
	He's probably the reason Papa didn't want me down here.
Debora
	Well, they're all rich folk, so I suppose they're bound to be quite fussy when it comes to their food.
Debora
	Are you sure we have time to be hanging
	around here?
Debora
	You usually have to make a reservation to get on the pontoon, but they're letting you on because you're with me.
Debora
	I suppose it's nice to wish upon a star every now and then.
Debora
	What? You think it's weird that I wish for things sometimes?
Debora
	I'd rather have a nice meal than a glass of champagne at the moment. I'm famished.
Debora
	Come to think of it, are you filling out our ship's log properly every day?
Debora
	I've never seen you doing it.
	Why the secrecy?
Debora
	What!? Who do you expect to do it if you don't?
Debora
	Huh! You'd just better make sure you do it from now on.
Debora
	Imagine the disappointment if you dreamt you'd had a big win and then woke up to find it was just a dream!
Debora
	What a fool! Surely he could've stopped before he ended up that bad.
Debora
	When I need to unwind, I find a good bit of shopping works much better than any gentle dancing could.
Debora
	Ah, but the problem with that philosophy is that tomorrow never comes.
Debora
	He certainly doesn't look like he's up to it nowadays.
Debora
	The sea air is just terrible for messing up my hair.
	I'll never get on with it.
Debora
	Um, isn't he the only one in charge?
	What happens to the ship when he sleeps?
Debora
	What a weird little ditty he's singing!
Debora
	For men? Really? Well, whatever floats his boat.
Debora
	I know it's his job, but he's the one ruining the atmosphere if you ask me.
Debora
	He's obviously gone and lost all his money and now he can't afford the fare home.
Debora
	Yes, I'd take the dancing any time.
Debora
	Listening to someone singing is dull.
Debora
	Are priests even allowed in casinos?
Debora
	I wonder if they'll put the Ventuno out to sea once it's peaceful again.
Debora
	It'd make it a bit awkward to get to, though.
Debora
	You're good for T 'n' T tickets, right, %a000090?
Debora
	You'll be in a lot of trouble if you tell me now we don't have any and I can't play!
Debora
	Hmph! It's bad luck to even say things like that when you're on a boat.
Debora
	Why would anyone become a sailor if they couldn't swim? I'd find another job if I was him.
Debora
	Maybe I should tell Papa and have him fired.
Debora
	Maybe we should sample some of his food if it's that perfect. You can try it first, though, and make sure it's good enough for me.
Tuppence
	I'm afraid it can't always be helped.
Tuppence
	In fact, some men would tread on her toes just so they could touch her, right, %a000090?
Debora
	Oh! Is that so, %a000090? So you'd like a turn later, would you?
Debora
	Hey! I was joking!
	Don't get too carried away.
Sancho
	You can no be young forever. Ees important to know yourself and your limitations.
Sancho
	Qué, friend? Why are you looking at me like thees?
	Your Uncle Sancho, he ees estill young enough!
Debora
	Papa's just the same. He always refuses to accept his limits. It's so annoying.
