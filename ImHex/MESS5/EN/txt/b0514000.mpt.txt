Nera
	It's such an old building, but whenever we come,
	it always looks so neat and tidy.
%0%a001240
	This is your knick-knackatory now, Dad, isn't it?
	It gets more amazing every time I look at it!
%0%a001250
	I love this building. It's got a really warm and comforting feel about it.
Sancho
	Sí. Ees muchos fresh here. The air, ees clear.
	Eet makes you ready for the siesta, no?
Tuppence
	This really is a cracking place. It's like the outside world's just stopped, and you can forget all
	about everything!
Bianca
	It's nice and tidy considerin' it was off the beaten track all that time. The old man must've taken care
	of the place.
Nera
	It's so still, isn't it? It's the perfect atmosphere for enjoying the exhibits.
%0%a001240
	What a huge room! My voice is echoing off the ceiling.
%0%a001250
	Who do you think put up such an enormous building? Was it Old Man Nick Knack, do you think?
Sancho
	Thees place ees beeg like the rooms een
	Gotha Castle.
Tuppence
	I wouldn't mind a place this big one day.
	It'd make a fine castle for King Tuppence!
Bianca
	It's good to see so many visitors in the place.
Nera
	You always put on your curator face when we come here. It makes you look so handsome!
%0%a001240
	It's still really quiet, even though there are loads of visitors. Is that what these places are always like?
%0%a001250
	Seeing more and more visitors coming makes me want to work even harder at making the place special.
Sancho
	You know, at first I no believe the people are gonna come eso far to esee the knicks and
	the knacks.
Tuppence
	Do you think Old Man Nick Knack handles the upkeep of the place all by himself? It must be a lot of work, what with the place being as big as it is.
Bianca
	This place dun't feel like a museum at the minute. There's somethin' funny in the air.
Nera
	All these scary exhibits... I feel like they're screaming at me. And it makes me want to scream back!
%0%a001240
	The people here at the moment aren't like the normal visitors we get, are they?
%0%a001250
	Dad, don't you think we should put some different things on display?
Sancho
	Ees no feeling like the museum at the moment, you know.
Tuppence
	I get the feeling a lot of these visitors aren't
	here simply to look at the exhibits, if you know
	what I mean.
Bianca
	There's only one spot to put somethin' on display in here. It'll have to be somethin' really special.
Nera
	It's like a special display room up here, isn't it?
	I suppose we'd better find an exhibit that fits the setting, hadn't we?
%0%a001240
	This room must be smaller than the ones below,
	but it feels really big.
%0%a001250
	There's something special about this room.
	It feels different somehow.
Sancho
	Ees a very beautiful room. Eet must take a
	long time and a lot of work to make thees
	place, eh?
Tuppence
	You want to put something on display here that really leaves an impression on people before
	they leave.
Bianca
	It's a bit creepy in the dark in here, eh?
Nera
	So this is where the exhibits that aren't on display are kept.
%0%a001240
	It's nice and cool down here, isn't it?
%0%a001250
	It's a shame for the exhibits down here, don't you think? I mean, it's so dark and cold.
Sancho
	You esmell the water down here?
	Sí. There ees muchos moisture een the air.
Tuppence
	It's a big storeroom, isn't it?
	As big as a castle vault, this.
Bianca
	I'll bet the old man planned on sleepin' here and runnin' the museum himself.
Nera
	This is a very neat room, isn't it? I thought there'd be more things in here to do with the exhibits.
%0%a001240
	Cool! This is like a secret room, hidden away under the stairs.
%0%a001250
	I bet you can hear whenever people go up and down the stairs.
Sancho
	Thees room, ees easy to clean, eh? Sí, your Uncle Sancho, he knows about esuch theengs.
Tuppence
	Everything in this room certainly seems to be shipshape and Bristol fashion, eh?
	Nothing in here that shouldn't be.
Bianca
	It's a bit scary bein' in a museum of a night, but it's got a special sort of feel to it too.
Nera
	It's even quieter at night, isn't it?
%0%a001240
	The exhibits look different in the middle of the night, don't they?
%0%a001250
	I wouldn't like to look at any of the scary
	exhibits now!
Sancho
	Now we are een the place at night, I feel eet even more. That you are really the curator
	now, friend.
Tuppence
	Every step you take echoes through the whole place at night, doesn't it? It's... Well, it's a bit scary!
Debora
	If you must pursue all this knick-knack nonsense,
	I suppose I'll allow it. But all the cleaning and polishing and things will be completely down to you, got it?
Debora
	He says we can do things how we want now, but I get the feeling he's going to be sticking his oar in at every available opportunity. Hmph. Men!
Debora
	How much is the entrance fee, actually?
	I bet this place is seriously overpriced.
Debora
	Finally! How long does it take a ghost to woo a guard these days anyway? Too long, it seems!
Debora
	Well it'll be a step up from having that wishy-washy old blabbermouth on reception, that's for sure.
Debora
	Why do men always want to take on young women when they're recruiting? Papa's the same. I just can't see the attraction.
Debora
	But what in the name of the Goddess does she see in all this...this junk!?
Debora
	Well, she's full of it, isn't she? ...Enthusiasm, I mean. Papa would snap her up in an instant if he saw her in action.
Debora
	ⓗHaaaⓘ to you too, old man. Maybe you haven't got any visitors because you're so haaard to please!
Debora
	Who does he think he is? Come on, let's find something to put on display just to shut him up!
Debora
	It'll be a real pain having to lug things around if you put them in the wrong places. Think it through before you do anything.
Debora
	No one's going to come to a tiny island stuck out in the middle of nowhere like this. But I suppose it'd be alright to stay here a bit longer.
Debora
	Wasn't he the one who said we could display whatever we wanted? He's very opinionated for a ghost, isn't he?
Debora
	Wasn't he the one who said we could display whatever we wanted? He's very opinionated for a ghost, isn't he?
Debora
	Wasn't he the one who said we could display whatever we wanted? He's very opinionated for a ghost, isn't he?
Debora
	My Goddess! How much complaining can one ghost do? I wish someone would chuck him and his precious knick-knacks in a coffin where they belong.
Debora
	Right! That's it! It's time we gathered every knick-knack and souvenir in the world, so he won't have anything more to grumble about.
Debora
	Just who does he think he is, talking to me like that?
Debora
	No one gives me orders! Especially not a ghost!
Debora
	Now we've built up such a collection, I want to see it finished. Go on, %a000090, off you go!
Debora
	Can't he just be satisfied? The pedestals are full, for heaven's sake! He's always making us jump through smaller and smaller hoops.
Debora
	Shouldn't go sticking your nose in!? It's none of your business, and even if it was, I wouldn't want your opinion, old man!
Debora
	Oh, yes. I believe him! He's practically coming back to life, he's so bothered by our display. He just can't help meddling.
Debora
	Why doesn't he just tell us what his grand plan is? Then at least we'd know what not to do!
Debora
	Er... Do you think maybe ⓚⓛ just maybe ⓚⓛ it would've been a good idea to tell us that earlier?
	Or did the senile old spook just forget, hm?
Debora
	Hmm... Switch things around, he says...
	Perhaps we could have a display of pretty jewellery... Or a display all about me!
Debora
	I wish he wouldn't say things like that. Now I want to know what he means.
Debora
	He seems like a doddery old fool, doesn't he?
	But he's got hidden depths, it seems.
Debora
	It is very relaxing. I need to relax, you know. It's very important for me. Let's rest here for a while.
Debora
	I'm thrilled that everyone else is having a whale of a time, but what about me?
Debora
	I'm rather more sophisticated than the average knick-knack anorak. I need more entertainment
	than this.
Debora
	Looking at everything that's on display, it makes you think what a peculiar world we live in, doesn't it?
Debora
	Well obviously! I've been helping out, so of course we've done a grand job.
Debora
	She seems like a very capable woman. Much like
	me, only not as pretty. Her talents are wasted on this place.
Debora
	Seems like the old man's got a bit of a crush, writing notes to the receptionist!
Debora
	New articles? Well how do we go about finding
	them, then?
Debora
	I thought he seemed unusually quiet. He's been grumbling on paper instead, it seems.
Debora
	Good luck. It seems the ghost's got plans for you.
Debora
	I like it as it is. It's unusual.
Debora
	He'll be on the fast track to Nadiria if he carries on telling us he's leaving things to us and then cursing us when we don't do what he wants.
Debora
	I hate slow and steady. It's boring.
Debora
	Don't waste any time, %a000090. Hurry up and make the place into something I can be proud of.
Debora
	Thank the Goddess! Hurry up and find the last few souvenirs we need, %a000090. I've had about as much knick-knackery as I can handle.
Debora
	Know-how about knick-knacks is know-how you don't need no how!
Debora
	He certainly seems to keep Sue abreast of his ideas.
Debora
	But he should keep his ideas about Sue's ⓚⓛ Ahem! ⓚⓛ to himself!
Debora
	ⓗMy knick-knackatoryⓘ!? I don't think so! He gave it to you, %a000090, so it's mine now. What's yours is mine, after all.
Debora
	If he bothered to write down what he was bothered about, we'd at least know what he wanted. Honestly, he's a hopeless diary writer!
Debora
	Are you having a good bash at it?
Debora
	I suppose it doesn't really matter. I mean, as long as I'm with you, you can't fail to impress.
Debora
	Oh dear. You've started to think like the old dodderer himself. I thought you'd started to look a bit wrinkly.
Debora
	Hm? Why don't I bake a cake or something?
	Not likely! Do I look like a servant?
Debora
	What isn't how he'd be liking it?
Debora
	Now I come to think of it, why did that beast give us a trophy? Isn't that a bit...odd?
Debora
	Well you are trying, it's true. Very trying indeed!
	No, sorry. I really mean it. You are.
Debora
	Where does that girl live, anyway? She's not here all the time, is she? That would just be too sad.
Debora
	What a spineless coward! It's just empty, that's all. It's not creepy.
Debora
	It's too...dull. The place needs livening up,
	otherwise no one's ever going to bother coming.
	I know I wouldn't.
Debora
	Oh dear! A bumpkin. I suppose a building like this would look grand to a bumpkin.
Debora
	All that man's interested in is how creepy the place does or doesn't feel. He gives me the creeps.
Debora
	That sounds like a complaint! Doesn't he know the lengths we've gone to in order to put all these things on display?
Debora
	Well, he's got something right at least. That's what souvenirs are after all... Things to remind you of places you've been.
Debora
	A man is nothing without proper guidance, though. Isn't that right, %a000090? You couldn't have done it without me.
Debora
	The rarer the item? Why don't I just climb up on that pedestal then? There could be no rarer beauty.
Debora
	It would be a pain if you had to live here, but it's a good location for a museum, I suppose. If you like that kind of thing.
Debora
	ⓗChicⓘ? Oh dear. That word is so out of fashion!
Debora
	Coming to a museum to do research is a bit...lazy, isn't it? He should be out there discovering things himself, not profiting from our hard work!
Debora
	A stunning exhibit? Look no further. Nothing is more stunning than what you see before you now.
Debora
	Only a bumpkin would feel nervous in a place like this. Poor thing.
Debora
	Absolutely! What a place to bring your bride!
Debora
	No, I don't. I wouldn't be fobbed off with a visit to a ridiculous knick-knackatory for my honeymoon!
Debora
	Which exhibit? If he wants us to believe him, he should be able to make us another one then,
	shouldn't he?
Debora
	What's he talking about? The room's completely empty.
Debora
	The truth!? He's lying through his teeth!
Debora
	Honestly! Fancy being so wrapped up in your own thoughts that you'd take your eyes off your child!
Debora
	That's just not what being a mother is all about.
	...What is it, %a000090? Why are you staring at me like that? Can't believe how beautiful I am?
Debora
	I don't know what kind of a craftsman that man is, but I think he'd be only too happy to make whatever it is he makes for me, don't you?
Debora
	Fancy not being able to stay away from here!
	He must be a bit strange.
Debora
	I hope he's planning on thanking me, seeing as how my museum's helped him get back on track again.
Debora
	What a weirdo! Who in their right mind would want to relax here?
Debora
	Isn't this room just full of the things that aren't worth putting on display upstairs? Do you think he needs his eyes tested?
Debora
	I didn't see that coming! I didn't think there was anyone out there who'd understand your quirky knick-knackery habits.
Debora
	Hang on, Zenithians can't just leave Zenithia whenever they feel like it, can they?
Debora
	A museum is such a boring place for a honeymoon. ...Come to think of it, where's my beach and 
	candlelit dinner?
Debora
	It's a husband's duty to keep his wife happy.
	Don't forget that, will you?
Debora
	What about woman's potential? My potential knows no bounds. That's all you need to know.
Debora
	How can you comment on how successful the place is without even a word of thanks to the woman who made it all possible? Very odd.
Debora
	That's why I don't like to show my face around here too much, you see. All the pretty knick-knacks just look dull next to me.
Debora
	Just so long as it's not something that'll go all mouldy and disgusting after a while.
Debora
	If it's something worthy of display, I suppose I could think about it. We'll see...
Debora
	I don't know what she's so pleased about. Presumably she's on holiday, but this is hardly a great place to relax.
Debora
	It's high time I had a place to relax, %a000090. You must build me a villa. No, a hotel, just for me! No...you couldn't build a hovel, let alone a hotel.
Debora
	Coming to a museum to do research is a bit...lazy, isn't it? He should be out there discovering things himself, not profiting from our hard work!
Debora
	There isn't a souvenir shop here, is there?
Debora
	So if you saw something you liked, you'd have to go all the way to goodness-knows-where to buy yourself one. What a pain!
Debora
	Whatever's the matter with that poet? He's boring, but he doesn't know it! Bursting into rhyme all the time... It's a crime!
Debora
	What part of the world does that man come
	from exactly?
Debora
	Unlikely for a plain thing like you, I'm afraid.
Debora
	Just what you'd expect from a bumpkin. They always come out with funny stuff like that.
Debora
	Don't ask me! I haven't got the first idea how anyone could get engrossed in all this knick-knack nonsense.
Debora
	It's a good point. The world is peculiar.
Debora
	I bet he's surprised that such a thing could become a famous knick-knack.
Debora
	I'm sure it's all fine and wonderful for bumpkins here, but it doesn't suit me.
Debora
	I'm sure having detailed discussions about knick-knacks is the perfect accompaniment to a drink in
	the pub.
Debora
	Don't ask me! I haven't got the first idea how anyone could get engrossed in all this knick-knack nonsense.
Debora
	Whatever's the matter with that poet? He's boring, but he doesn't know it! Bursting into rhyme all the time... It's a crime!
Debora
	What sort of establishment does she think this
	is exactly?
Debora
	%0%a000090! You're not...looking at her, are you!?
	No, you'd know better than that, wouldn't you?
Debora
	This place seems to do that to people...
	It makes them go a bit loopy.
Debora
	What's there to be scared about?
Debora
	Still, I can see you're not entirely comfortable with it either, %a000090, so I'll escort you if we ever have to come here at night.
Debora
	No need to worry. The curator is most definitely off-limits. But for the record, this is the worst honeymoon destination in history!
Debora
	A certain beauty? Could he be talking about me?
	I'm certainly a beauty.
Debora
	How can he just stand there and say that!?
	Doesn't he know the hardships I've been through
	to collect all these, these...things?
Debora
	He must have swum across the ocean to end up looking as terrible as that!
Debora
	They're not all frightening...
Debora
	Although, having been blinded by my beauty, everything else probably looks awful.
Debora
	I hate to break it to you, but you're not the most trustworthy-looking man yourself.
Debora
	With so many shifty-looking types loitering about the place, it's impossible to tell who you need to look out for and who you don't.
Debora
	Who in the name of the Goddess is that?
	Has he been possessed by a monster, do you think?
Debora
	If you're going to let people like that into the place, you're asking for trouble, you know.
Debora
	You think you're imagining these things, but ask the experts and they'll tell you... They're real!
Debora
	Who is that bumpkin, and how does he know about the Catas Trophy?
Debora
	It doesn't quite fit, it's true. But what would be the right exhibit, I wonder...
Debora
	An expert in knick-knacks? Then he must be rich!
	Not as rich as Papa, of course, but still...
Debora
	Huh! He's forever hanging about here doing nothing, and he has the cheek to claim that he's the busy one!
Debora
	An amateur!? That's practically praise for you, isn't it? Better than being called ignorant or something. Still, I don't like his tone...
Debora
	Pah! He's transparent! He hasn't got a clue if it's well-made or not. He's just a ship in a bottle freak. Or he's on the bottle. One or the other.
Debora
	But this is a gem cut by a super-famous jeweller.
Debora
	I bet the ones you have at home weren't, were they?
Debora
	They're famous, and that's all there is to it. Does he have to whinge about everything?
Debora
	%0%a000090! Why are you putting exhibits on display that aren't up to scratch?
Debora
	You'll polish them tonight, got it?
Debora
	And I'd say the set I use at home is a little better than yours, you big show-off!
Debora
	Papa is rich and owns lots of things too, but he doesn't feel the need to own the biggest and best of everything. Perhaps this man's...lacking somehow.
Debora
	How can he just stand there in the presence of such beauty and not acknowledge it? I'm deeply hurt.
Debora
	ⓗWhat a shameⓘ? He's trying to sound sincere, but, well...failing miserably.
Debora
	I don't know what craftsman he has in mind, but there's no way he'll be able to make something that beats ours.
Debora
	I can't say that I really believe in the Goddess and all those religious ramblings really, either.
	But I don't think ⓗshabbyⓘ is the right word...
Debora
	I remember now. Papa talked about that slime
	curio too.
Debora
	I don't know why rich people always seem to want such strange things.
Debora
	ⓗA reasonable amount of goldⓘ!?
	Don't they sell for a thousand gold coins each?
	He hasn't got a clue, has he?
Debora
	ⓗA frightful pestⓘ? Takes one to know one!
	...Sorry, %a001210!
Debora
	I thought you could only lay your hands on Zoomshine if the people of Zoomingale took a
	shine to you. Isn't that why it's called ⓗZoomshineⓘ?
Debora
	He'll never get a case if that's the case.
Debora
	Papa likes to flash his gold about the place too, but he never makes things difficult for other people.
Debora
	Let's take him to the desert and leave him there. What do you say, %a000090?
Debora
	Then he'll find out how much hard work it is...
	How it damages your skin. And how your nails get broken. And how your hair gets matted. And, and...
Debora
	Even so, who's he to tell us that?
Debora
	Papa never gave me one of them, so they must be very hard to come by indeed.
Debora
	I know they can be useful all over the place, not just up in the mountains, but...what's he hoping to achieve by giving one to everybody he employs?
Debora
	That was a rather uneasy laugh. Do I detect a hint of a lie? Checkmate, Fatso.
Debora
	ⓗGaudyⓘ? I don't think so. The man wouldn't know beauty if it slapped him in the face. And if he keeps on annoying me, it's about to!
Debora
	If you have enough of anything, it's worth something. That's what Papa used to say.
Debora
	Urgh! I detest men who don't realise what's right in front of their eyes!
Debora
	I get the impression he'd still say faeries were a figment of the imagination even if there was one
	right in front of him!
Debora
	I'd love to take him to Nadiria and prove it to him.
	I'm sure he'd enjoy it there!
Debora
	I don't like the way he's talking to us, but he's absolutely right. It's very important to recycle.
	Using it as scrap paper is a good idea.
Debora
	He must have stayed there a fair few nights, then. Perhaps he didn't get the hint in the name of
	the place...
Debora
	Sounds like he doesn't have any himself.
	Ha ha! I win!
Debora
	If you think it's ridiculous, give it a try.
	I'll cover my ears...
Debora
	Your mother and father invited this man to
	their wedding!?
Debora
	It hardly sounds likely, but how else would he know about the locket?
Debora
	He's acting as if he's moved to tears now!
	What's this man's story?
Debora
	I think Nadiria would suit him down to the ground.
	Or should I say ⓗdown under the groundⓘ?
	He's a selfish, greedy heathen!
Debora
	I hope he's doing his job properly. I've invested an awful lot of time and energy in this place.
Debora
	How much is the entrance fee if this is our cut?
Debora
	ⓗEarned the rightⓘ? He's got a cheek! We've done more than our fair share of earning already!
Debora
	He wants us to rearrange things now?
	He's going to have to start paying us more...
Debora
	Where's he going to sleep if he stays the night here?
Debora
	He just doesn't seem like a ghost. I mean, do ghosts normally snore? Or is he grumbling in his sleep now?
Debora
	He's going to be in the way when the cleaners turn up if he stays here. Shall I turf him out?
Debora
	It's very quiet here. Yes, this could be the perfect spot for my villa.
Debora
	It's very well furnished, isn't it?
Debora
	Perhaps the old fogey was a man of means before he popped his clogs.
Debora
	For a tiny, isolated island, this place is surprisingly accessible, isn't it?
Debora
	It feels more like a shock-horrortory than a knick-knackatory now.
Debora
	This room is even more lavishly decorated than
	the others.
Debora
	An exhibit for display in here would need to
	be lavish too. I can help with that. I'm very good
	at lavish.
Debora
	It's a bit strange that there are pedestals in the storeroom, isn't it? Still, we can put all the second-rate junk down here, I suppose.
Debora
	So this is where the old dodderer livesⓚⓛ
	I mean, died...
	I mean...rests in peace...
Debora
	He's still using it, by the look of it. It's immaculate. Just like me!
Debora
	You can't put out the lights just because it's night-time, you know.
Debora
	Dazzling as I am, I couldn't light up a whole museum!
Tuppence
	Well, I'm a man and I've got potential!
	I'm...almost sure of it!
Debora
	Don't worry, Tuppence. You do have potential.
Tuppence
	Really!? I knew it! Thank you, Debora!
	Er, what...sort of potential?
Debora
	Potential to be a good servant, of course!
	Why else would I care?
Tuppence
	Of, of course. Yes.
Debora
	Well, I agree that they're hardly the greatest of wedding presents...
Debora
	...but I don't enjoy this old man talking about my honey buns one little bit.
