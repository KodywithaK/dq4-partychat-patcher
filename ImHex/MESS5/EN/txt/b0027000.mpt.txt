*: 
	Meow!
*: 
	Welcome to Whealbrook.
*: 
	Turns out that man Pankraz who was here all them years ago was King of Gotha no less!
*: 
	Well, I'll be! I can't tell you what a surprise it was to find that out.
*: 
	The cave entrance is just up ahead.
*: 
	There are no monsters in there any more, though.
*: 
	Hm? Well, well! If it isn't %a000090!
*: 
	So you're back! We've heard all sorts of tales of what you've been up to, I can tell you!
*: 
	Becomin' king, for one thing! And then there's that business of you defeatin' the Grandmaster of the Underworld.
*: 
	We're all proud as Punch of you back here, %a000090. Proud as Punch!
*: 
	Pub's not open 'til this evening, I'm afⓚⓛ
	Blimey! Is that really you, %a000090?
*: 
	Or should I say King %a000090?
	You've certainly done well for yourself, eh?
*: 
	Dear me! I turn my head for a second, and come back to find the pot practically licked clean!
*: 
	The old man should just speak up if he's that hungry.
*: 
	Mmm...delicious!
*: 
	The old dragon always blames me for wolfin' down her food, so I thought I may as well scoff the lot!
*: 
	Haven't we met somewhere before? I've been over in Lodestar Harbour 'til just recently.
*: 
	I just couldn't seem to ditch my dream of
	becomin' a pharmacist, though. That's why I'm
	back here again.
*: 
	Hopefully I'll be a pro before long, just like good old Rockefeller.
*: 
	Did you want to speak with the master?
	He's upstairs if you need him.
*: 
	Long ago, Pankraz and %a000090, the grandfather and father of the legendary hero, lived here in this house.
*: 
	Oh? You already knew that? I see. Come here to see the place especially, have you?
*: 
	No! You used to live here?
*: 
	B-But! That would make you...
	Good heavens!
~ Leave Whealbrook and continue on your way? ~
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ah ha ha hah!
	Tutti-frutti! Tutti-frutti!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	The Grandmaster of Nadiria's not so grandioso any more, eh, %a000120? So we can all enjoy the dolce vita at last!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Nothing that I wouldn't have expected of %a000090 and his two mighty bambinos!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You would have made a fine husband for my Nera, %a000090. But let's not cloud this fine day with regrets.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Yes, rarely has there been a finer day!
	Tutti-frutti all round!
Romana
	I was completely gobsmacked when I found out.
Romana
	Your son, the legendary hero!
Romana
	I'm sure it was fate that you and Bianca
	were married.
*: 
	Mr Briscoletti's been going around with a beaming smile on his face all day.
*: 
	He keeps going on and on about how it was his boat that the legendary hero used to sail around the world in.
*: 
	He's saying it to every single person he
	comes across!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ah ha ha hah!
	Tutti-frutti! Tutti-frutti!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	The Grandmaster of Nadiria's not so grandioso any more, eh, %a000120? So we can all enjoy the dolce vita at last!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You've turned out to be a fitting match for my Nera, %a000090.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	And here is my bambino! I hardly recognised you, it's been so long.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	And my beautiful pair of scaramouches!
	It's wonderful to see you all.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	So, Rodrigo Briscoletti is the grandfather of the legendary hero!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	If I wasn't the man I am, I might almost feel embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha hah!
Romana
	I hope you'll stick with my little girl even now all this excitement has passed, %a000090?
Romana
	And Nera...
	There's something I need to tell you.
Nera
	It's alright, Mama. I know.
	And so does she.
Nera
	But I love you and Papa more than I could love even my real parents.
Romana
	Oh, Nera. That's so sweet...
*: 
	Mr Briscoletti's been going around with a beaming smile on his face all day.
*: 
	He keeps going on and on about how he's the grandfather of the legendary hero.
*: 
	He's saying it to every single person he
	comes across!
*: 
	Come on, join in the dancing!
	There's celebrating to be done!
*: 
	La la-la-lah... La la-la-lah...
	La la-la lah lah laaaah!
*: 
	I don't know how many years it's been since I enjoyed some dancing. I feel like I'm sixteen again!
*: 
	Oh my! You're %H0860%Xone of the heroes%Ythe heroes%Z who defeated the Grandmaster of Nadiria, aren't you?
	Tee hee hee hee! I'm so embarrassed!
*: 
	Dancing like this, all footloose and fancy-free, really brings it home to you, doesn't it?
	Peace! At last!
*: 
	The Goddess is smiling down on this festival of joy now that the world is once more at peace.
*: 
	It is all as the Goddess intended.
*: 
	May you and your family continue to live under Her divine protection.
*: 
	I'm too happy to do any work today!
	Far too happy!
*: 
	Wahey! Wahoo!
	I'm as old as can be!
*: 
	I never even dreamt I'd see this day in my lifetime! It's great being old! Wahoo!
Bingo
	Bau! Bau, bau, bau!
	Bau, bau, bau-au-au-aaaau!
*: 
	Aaaah! That's the best drink I've had in years!
	Well, I mean, it's hard to beat a freebie, isn't it!
*: 
	Maybe it's time I made a lifestyle change now the world's at peace and everything. I could get married!
*: 
	Drinks are on the house today!
	Courtesy of Mr Briscoletti!
*: 
	All the grown-ups are busy having a party, so I'm in charge of the shop. I'm trustworthy, you see, that's why.
Crispin
	Ah-ha! %0%a000090! You and your party really are a gift from the Goddess.
Crispin
	When I think that I competed against such an accomplished rival for Nera's hand in marriage, I...
Crispin
	Well, it makes me feel a lot more confident
	about myself.
Nera
	Thank you. Thank you all so much.
Nera
	%0%a000090, Bianca, and your two wonderful children, of course.
Nera
	I hope you have many long and happy years together.
Crispin
	Ah-ha! %0%a000090! You and your party really are a gift from the Goddess.
Crispin
	When I think that I competed against such an accomplished rival for Nera's hand in marriage, I...
Crispin
	Well, it makes me feel a lot more confident
	about myself.
Ashlee
	You are just ze 'andsome, strong man my 'usband described to me, %a000090.
~ Leave Mostroferrato and continue on your way? ~
Whitey
	So you managed to give that Grandmaster of the Underworld the what-for, eh?
Whitey
	And now here the four of you are, come to visit me as a family.
Whitey
	Lovely stuff, lovely stuff.
Whitey
	We've got a lot of catchin' up to do, eh?
	Why dun't you stay the night?
Bianca
	Sorry, Dad, but...
Whitey
	Oh, right. The folks over in Gotha are waitin' for %a000090's homecomin', are they?
Whitey
	Well, fair enough. I s'pose he is king o' the place, after all, eh?
Whitey
	You folks had better get a move on back to
	Gotha, then.
Bianca
	We'll come back and see you again soon, Dad.
Whitey
	Just as long as it's the both of you, eh? I dun't want to see you turnin' up on the doorstep on your own because you pair have had a row! Ha ha ha!
Whitey
	Let me be havin' a look at them lovely grandchildren
	o' mine!
Whitey
	%0%a001240 and %a001250... I can see you both growin' up to be fine folk, just like your mum and dad.
Bianca
	%0%a000090!
	You've come to visit!
Bianca
	We've heard all sorts of rumours here about you lot goin' off and savin' the world.
Bianca
	I never imagined you'd turn out to be such a force to be reckoned with.
Bianca
	You were no use to man or beast that time we went off ghost-bustin' together all them years ago!
Bianca
	I'm sure it must be your influence on him, Nera.
Bianca
	You keep takin' good care of him, eh?
Whitey
	I was ever so surprised to find out about you bein' King of Gotha, %a000090.
Whitey
	It's lovely that you still take a bit of time out to come and see us common folk, though.
Whitey
	Stop by whenever you feel like it, eh? I'm sure Bianca'll always be glad to see you.
Bianca
	You dun't feel like a stranger to me any more, Nera. Neither does Debora.
Bianca
	It'd be nice if we could all get to know each other even better, eh?
*: 
	Meow.
*: 
	Now it's all peaceful again, the baths'll probably be crawlin' with tourists.
*: 
	Well they'd better leave space for us locals, or I might have to knock some heads together!
*: 
	That one just refuses to accept he's no spring chicken any more, the silly old fool!
*: 
	Purrr!
*: 
	That son of mine's only sayin' he wants to be a priest now, of all things!
*: 
	He's got the inside of our house decked out like it was a church, y'know.
*: 
	Still, folk are sayin' the world's at peace again. Maybe it's thanks to my boy!
*: 
	Well, you folks are certainly an impressive team if ever there was one!
*: 
	I s'pose I can't blame Bianca for fallin' in love with you. You win some, you lose some, eh?
*: 
	I'm pretty happy, I can tell you.
*: 
	To think that the veil I made was worn by the mother of the boy who saved the world!
*: 
	There's not many veil-makers who can boast that kind o' thing!
*: 
	It is all as the Goddess intended.
*: 
	May the Goddess continue to bestow her blessing on the legendary hero and all members of his clan!
*: 
	I'm too happy to do any work today!
	Far too happy!
*: 
	I never imagined we'd see peace again in my lifetime. I dun't know how to thank you!
*: 
	Oh my! You're %H0860%Xone of the heroes%Ythe heroes%Z who defeated the Grandmaster of Nadiria, aren't you?
	Tee hee hee hee! I'm so embarrassed!
*: 
	Well, well. The world's at peace at last, is it?
*: 
	That calls for a good slap-up meal then, I'd say, wouldn't you?
*: 
	I know a little secret. Turns out Bianca en't Whitey's real daughter.
*: 
	Nope. He found her abandoned when he was walkin' in the mountains one day.
*: 
	Oops! Maybe I wasn't supposed to be tellin'
	folk that...!

Romana
	You see, by birth, you and Debora aren't actually ourⓚⓛ
Nera
	And although she probably would never come out and say so, I'm quite sure that Debora feels the same way.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ah ha ha hah!
	Tutti-frutti! Tutti-frutti!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	The Grandmaster of Nadiria's not so grandioso any more, eh, %a000120? So we can all enjoy the dolce vita at last!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You never cease to amaze me, %a000090. When you chose to take my Debora for a wife, I knew you were hardy...like one of Romana's ciabattas!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	But I never imagined you would turn out to be such a great man.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You've even managed to soften Debora a little, if I'm not mistaken!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	And my beautiful pair of scaramouches!
	It's wonderful to see you all.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	So, Rodrigo Briscoletti is the grandfather of the legendary hero!
Rodrigo Briscoletti

	There's something I need to tell you.
Romana
	You see, by birth, you and Nera aren't actually ourⓚⓛ
Debora
	Yes, about that...
	Nera and I already know.
Debora
	But neither of us are bothered, so it's nothing to get worked up about.
Romana
	Oh, Debora.
	That means a lot to me.
Crispin
	Ah-ha! %0%a000090! You and your party really are a gift from the Goddess.
Crispin

Debora
	Don't get too carried away there, Crispin.
Debora
	It's not as if you played any part in it, after all.
Nera
	Thank you. Thank you all so much.
Nera
	%0%a000090, Debora, and %a001240 and %a001250, of course.
Nera
