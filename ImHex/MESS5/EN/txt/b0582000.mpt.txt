	Hey, I remember this place! This is where you spent all those years as a statue, right, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I thought long and hard about how to first greet you when I found you, Dad.
%0%a001250
	I hope I made a good job of it.
%0%a001250
	It's nice to see you living and breathing again, Dad. Not like the statue you were all those years.
Sancho
	Ees lucky the señor who ees leeving here, he ees no hot een the head, eh?
Sancho
	Eef he had broken your estatue, friend...
	I, I no know what I would do! (sniff)
Sancho
	Ees because of your wonderful children that you are back to normal now. You must eshower them weeth praises later, friend.
Tuppence
	So this is where you spent all those years as a statue, is it, %a000090?
Tuppence
	What a lovely spot! I wouldn't be surprised if this island ends up on the tourist map before long.
%0%a001240
	Oh! You must've seen him being snatched while you were standing here as a statue.
%0%a001240
	I wonder where the monsters can have
	carried him off to.
%0%a001250
	That poor little boy must be just as upset as his parents, being separated like that.
%0%a001250
	I can imagine how he must feel. It's a bit like how it was for us.
Sancho
	Estill no one knows where ees Georgie?
Sancho
	The poor boy! And hees poor madre and papá! We pray! We pray to the Goddess that he ees esafe.
Tuppence
	If only we could find him and bring him back... In fact, I wonder if that's what she's hoping.
%0%a001250
	She's crying out in her sleep just like Sancho does.
%0%a001240
	I wonder if Mum would be like that if
	I ever got kidnapped.
Sancho
	I, I can no watch thees woman esuffer any more! Come, My Majesty! We go now, por favor.
%0%a001240
	I wonder why he doesn't go off looking for his son. That's what you'd do, right, Dad?
%0%a001250
	That poor man!
Sancho
	You know, the people, they are no talking about eet eso often, but eet ees estill happening.
Sancho
	For the young child to be kidnapped...
	Ees, ees too horrible!
Bianca
	So you spent all those years as a statue in the garden here, eh, %a000090?
Bianca
	Now's not the time for dwellin' on the past.
	We should move on.
Nera
	So this is the place where you spent all those years as a statue, darling.
Nera
	This place is certainly a fair distance from the temple I was at all that time.
Nera
	It's horrible to think about how far apart we were.
%0%a001240
	Hey, I remember this place! This is where you spent all those years as a statue, right, Dad?
%0%a001240
	We knew you were here for a while before we actually came and rescued you.
%0%a001240
	But we didn't know how to turn a statue back into a human again. Sorry we kept you waiting a bit.
%0%a001250
	I thought long and hard about how to first greet you when I found you, Dad.
%0%a001250
	I hope I made a good job of it.
%0%a001250
	It's nice to see you living and breathing again, Dad. Not like the statue you were all those years.

	Ees lucky the señor who ees leeving here, he ees no hot een the head, eh?

Sancho
	Ees because of your wonderful children that you are back to normal now. You must eshower them weeth praises later, friend.
Tuppence
	So this is where you spent all those years as a statue, is it, %a000090?
Tuppence
	What a lovely spot! I wouldn't be surprised if this island ends up on the tourist map before long.
Bianca
	It's nice to see someone so happy. And it's all thanks to you, %a000090, for puttin' that nasty Order of Zugzwang lot in their place.
Nera
	How lovely! This just goes to show how all of your efforts to defeat the Order of Zugzwang paid off.
%0%a001240
	She's so happy that she's actually crying!
	How embarrassing!
%0%a001250
	When you're really happy, you sometimes cry. That's what happened to me when we found Mum.
Sancho
	Now we know for esure that thees Order of Zugzwang, they are the desperados.
Tuppence
	It's nice to see people caring about each other so much. We should go home to Gotha every once in a while, you know.
Bianca
	There's nothin' more important than family.
	I feel that more strongly than ever now.
Nera
	I must admit that I feel a little bit envious.
	It would be so nice if we could have a normal
	family life one day.
%0%a001240
	He doesn't seem to realise that you're the statue he's talking about!
%0%a001240
	And after you were supposed to have brought such good luck to them too. How rude!
Sancho
	Ees eso wonderful to esee thees señor laughing like the buffoon. Eet warms your heart, no? (sniff)
Sancho
	Thees ees good news for everyone. The time,
	eet was estopped for them, but now they can estart their lives again.
Nera
	She's just like me, not having had the chance to watch her baby grow up.
%0%a001240
	I don't need toys! Why would I need toys when I have the Zenithian Sword to play with!?
Bianca
	Hey! The Zenithian Sword en't a toy, you know!
	A bit of respect wouldn't go amiss!
%0%a001240
	Sorry, Mum!
Bianca
	Our job en't done yet, but it's nice to get some thanks along the way.
Nera
	He was taken in by the Order of Zugzwang, wasn't he? It's wonderful that you were able to rescue him.
%0%a001240
	If we leave those monsters from the underworld
	to their own devices, the same thing is bound to happen again.
%0%a001240
	We have to get to Nadiria, Dad, and fast!
%0%a001250
	Did we meet him before? I don't really remember...
	He he he!
Tuppence
	When you consider all we did, we deserve a lot more gratitude than we geⓚⓛ Er, don't mind me! I'm just mumbling away!
Debora
	So you were put on display here in this garden?
Debora
	I was in pride of place at the Crocodilopolis and you were stuck here. Our roles as servant and master are obviously predestined!
Debora
	If Sancho and the children hadn't found you, you'd have ended up standing here forever.
Debora
	See how much trouble you've caused us all!
Debora
	That's all down to my servant having defeated the Order of Zugzwang. More thanks are in order if you ask me!
Debora
	I'd like to get all this nonsense over with and relax at last too, so you'd better pull your finger out, %a000090.
Debora
	She's had the same experience as me, not having seen her baby grow up.
Debora
	If he's in your debt, then he's in mine too.
	I'm the boss around here after all.
