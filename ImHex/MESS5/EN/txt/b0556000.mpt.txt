Bianca
	Who in their right mind would plan a town out to
	be this complicated? It must be an impossible place
	to live.
Bianca
	You couldn't afford to get a bit doddery on
	your feet in your old age if you lived here,
	that's for sure.
Nera
	It's so nice to be able to walk around freely, even in a place as tricky to navigate as this.
Nera
	The person who designed the town layout here must have had a whale of a time!
%0%a001240
	This place is cool! Is it a path? Is it a wall?
	Who can tell? It's like a maze!
%0%a001240
	First turn, then go up the stairs, then... Um... Is this where you're supposed to go down?
%0%a001240
	Ha ha! I'm just trying to figure out the shortest way to do a circuit around town.
%0%a001250
	This place has a sort of magical air to it, I think.
%0%a001250
	Can you look back once in a while and make sure I'm still with you, Dad? I'm worried I might get lost.
Sancho
	Thees place, ees loco! First you esee a wall, but then ees a path. Now you esee a path, but ees a dead end!
Sancho
	Ees no the kind of town you can run around rápido. You must take eet eslowly, sí? Mañana, mañana.
Tuppence
	There's no need to worry. If we get really lost,
	we can just knock a hole in the wall and tunnel
	our way out.
Bianca
	En't this the place you learnt a new spell off that old man, %a000090?
Nera
	Mama and Papa say they brought me here when I was little, but I don't remember a thing.
%0%a001240
	I don't think we came here when we were travelling about with Sancho.
Bianca
	There used to be smoke billowin' about the place all day long in the old days. It was quite a sight, eh?
Nera
	It's a worry about Professor Toilen Trubble.
	I do hope he's alright.
%0%a001240
	I wonder what kind of research Professor Toilen Trubble was doing that caused all that smoke.
%0%a001240
	Oh, you know all about it? Huh!
Sancho
	Thees professor, señor Trubble, he ees your
	friend, no?
Sancho
	You must visit heem and esee how he ees doing.
Bianca
	Once a rumour like that gets about,
	there's no stoppin' it.
Nera
	We can only pray that not too many people have been taken in by that kind of talk.
%0%a001250
	That's not true, right? The Goddess doesn't show favouritism like that, does She?
Sancho
	I hear many rumours about thees Order of Zugzwang these days. The world, ees no esuch a nice place no more.
Tuppence
	Some people seem to thrive on the idea that the world may be coming to an end. The Order of Zugzwang are a prime example.
Bianca
	That en't no rumour. We know it's the truth, eh?
Nera
	Are you alright, darling? You look a bit troubled.
%0%a001240
	What's wrong, Dad? You've gone a bit green.
%0%a001250
	I hate the idea of slavery! Anyone who turns people into slaves must be really, really wicked!
Bianca
	It looks like people who weren't at the Crocodilopolis that time are still brainwashed.
Nera
	But the Order of Zugzwang is finished. It looks like she still hasn't heard.
%0%a001250
	That woman's eyes are scary. Can we hurry up and get away from her?
Sancho
	Thees book you have purchased, My Majesty, ees eet to help us on our quest?
Tuppence
	No, if anyone's going to bring peace back to the world, it's you, %a000090. Ha ha!
Bianca
	For your own good!? She really has bin taken in by the whole thing, eh?
%0%a001240
	Three thousand gold coins for a book of drivel
	like that? She's got to be joking!
Sancho
	You are right, friend. Eef you buy these theengs from the followers of the Order of Zugzwang, they gonna have more money for their evil plans.
Tuppence
	That woman's about the same age as my mother,
	and yet there she is, extolling the virtues of Korol
	of all people!
%0%a001240
	You can't go spending three thousand gold coins on a book like that, Dad! What a waste!
%0%a001250
	I love books, but I wouldn't want to read that one. You don't need to worry about buying it, okay, Dad?
Sancho
	Anyone can esee what thees señora ees doing.
	She ees a book barracuda, eh, friend? Feeding
	on the hungry bookworms.
Bianca
	Hang on a minute! Are we lost too?
Bianca
	Huh, I thought as much. If only we could just jump down off the walls, it'd be dead easy.
Bianca
	Phew. That's a relief. I'm countin' on you, okay, %a000090?
Nera
	I wouldn't get lost even if I walked around with my eyes closed.
Nera
	I have you to look after me and guide me in the right direction, after all!
%0%a001250
	He he he! It's funny to see that an adult
	can get lost too!
Tuppence
	That man's armour is fairly rusty. And his facial hair is totally out of control.
Tuppence
	Yep, I'd say he must've been wandering about lost for at least five years now!
Bianca
	Yeah, there is a lovely breeze blowin' here all the time, eh?
Nera
	The view here is incredible. I can imagine it's a very relaxing spot.
%0%a001240
	He's right, it is a nice breeze. Maybe it's always windy here, judging by all the windmills they have.
Bianca
	City!? Dun't look much like a city to me!
%0%a001240
	If they think this place is big, I wonder what
	they'd make of somewhere like Fortuna or
	Lodestar Harbour!
Sancho
	These men, they are travellers like us, sí?
Nera
	How odd! I wonder why they're so worried about people finding out they're from the country.
%0%a001250
	I love the country! It's so much more relaxing than being in a town, and there are lots of lovely rivers and fields to play in.
%0%a001240
	You'd have thought you'd be able to see a tower that tall from anywhere. I suppose the world's bigger than you'd think.
Bianca
	I can understand him wantin' a drink, but he must be pretty desperate to be hangin' about waitin' here on his own.
Nera
	He must really love to drink if he's waiting for the pub doors to open!
%0%a001240
	If he needs a drink that badly, then why doesn't he just have some water? I don't get it!
Bianca
	If only he could channel his enthusiasm for the drink into somethin' more useful, eh?
Nera
	I seem to remember the same thing happening before.
%0%a001250
	He wasn't very happy, was he?
Tuppence
	How rude! Fancy accosting the ruler of a kingdom and treating him like a lowly barman!
Bianca
	Smell that booze in the air! I reckon you could get a bit tipsy just from breathin' in this place!
Nera
	Do you think they can really get through that much drink in one night?
Bianca
	Hmm. I can't help feelin' like he's hidin' somethin'.
Nera
	Don't you think he looked a little shifty? Almost as if he was fibbing to us for some reason.
%0%a001240
	Sounds a bit fishy to me.
Sancho
	Ees better eef we no ask too many questions, My Majesty. Eet eseems like a delicate esituation.
Bianca
	When people have a drink that tasty, they usually try to make money out of it.
Bianca
	The folk here must love the old booze an awful lot if they decided to keep it a secret and enjoy it by themselves instead!
%0%a001240
	Don't drink any of the Zoomshine here will you, Dad. If you wait until I grow up, we can drink it together.
Sancho
	Uf, I weesh I could try esome of thees Zoomshine...
	But ees, ees yours, no mine...
	(mutter mutter)
Tuppence
	If it tastes as good as he says, I should imagine it would fetch a fair old price.
Bianca
	It's interestin' to see a town full of so many different types of folk again, eh?
Nera
	It must be fun living with lots of people like they do here. Never a dull moment!
Tuppence
	How sweet she looks when she sleeps!
	Perhaps we should go to sleep too, %a000090!
Sancho
	No, friend! Ees wrong to approach a señorita when eshe ees esleeping.
Bianca
	Parents just can't seem to help worryin', eh?
Nera
	Children are so adorable. I wish I'd been able to see our children more when they were tiny.
%0%a001240
	Why does it mean she won't get grandchildren just because her son's a worry? I don't get it!
Tuppence
	I hope I manage to produce grandchildren for
	my mother before long. Better find a wife first,
	I suppose!
Bianca
	If that's what floats his boat, then who are we
	to argue?
Nera
	The thing that makes me happiest is being with my family. Wouldn't you agree, %a000090?
%0%a001240
	I'm happiest when I'm playing! Especially when it's with you, Dad!
%0%a001250
	That man's a bit scary. I'm sure he'd gobble me up if I got too close!
Sancho
	For me, the happiness, ees, ees, ees, ees...
	Ees difficult to esay...
Tuppence
	I'd say I'm at my happiest when I imagine how much more respected I'll be in the future.
Tuppence
	Roll on the day when people are bowing and scraping at my feet. ⓗYes, Mr Tuppence! No, Mr Tuppence!ⓘ ...That kind of thing.
Bianca
	You already know where the doors to the underworld are, right, %a000090? I suppose we'd better hurry on over there.
Nera
	What a terrible burden %a001240 has on his shoulders. We must do all that we can to support him.
%0%a001240
	I'll do my best, don't worry. Then, once the world's
	all peaceful and everything, I can play as much as I like, right?
%0%a001250
	%0%a001240's doing his best, but it is really hard on him. It's a bit of a worry.
Sancho
	The Goddess, what plan does eshe have for us all?
	Ees no right for one eso young to have esuch weight on hees eshoulders.
Tuppence
	It's certainly a big responsibility, being trusted with something so important. I'm not sure I'd manage it
	if it were me.
Bianca
	I imagine it'd frighten away the customers too, if it's as bad as it sounds.
Bianca
	Seems like the folk here like to have a bit of fun where the old Zoomshine's concerned. Let's just
	keep quiet, eh?
Nera
	Why would it be their famous brew if it tastes
	so terrible?
Nera
	There's no need for him to be quite so vocal.
	It's not like we'd wipe the town out of its supplies
	or anything!
%0%a001240
	That old man's pretty determined, isn't he? He really doesn't want us to get hold of any.
Sancho
	Weeth esuch a dreenk, our journey, ees gonna be easy, no?
%0%a001240
	Ooh! You're not supposed to run about
	in church, are you?
Sancho
	Een thees loco town, ees no possible to run around outside. Ees too dangerous for the young ones.
%0%a001240
	That kid doesn't seem to care about being told off.
%0%a001250
	That boy's stupid! I'm worried he's going to
	bang into me.
Bianca
	I dun't know much about magic research, but it looks like it must be hard work.
Nera
	Oh dear! What an awful cough! We should make
	sure we drop in on him from time to time to check
	he's alright.
%0%a001240
	Hocus Pocus...
%0%a001240
	Just the name of it is enough to send tingles down my spine. It must be a pretty powerful spell!
Sancho
	Ees no right to make thees old señor esit up
	een hees condition! You must be considerate
	of the elderly.
Tuppence
	Hocus Pocus!
Tuppence
	Hocus Pocus! Hocus Pocus!
	Hocuuuus Poooocus!
Tuppence
	...Hmph! Nothing happened!
	Is that old man having us on?
Bianca
	We must do somethin' to repay old Professor
	Toilen Trubble for all his hard work once
	everythin' calms down.
Nera
	I'll be keeping Professor Toilen Trubble in my
	prayers and asking the Goddess to grant him
	a speedy recovery.
%0%a001240
	Is that old man alright?
	He doesn't look very well to me.
%0%a001250
	That old man's really clever. You can almost smell the magic brewing here in his house.
Tuppence
	I wonder how much that old man really knows about all this. I can't help but feel a bit doubtful.
Bianca
	Oh, I get it! So that's what it's all about. We'd better not go guzzlin' it down if it's that valuable, then!
Nera
	I don't think even Papa knew about this Zoomshine. We must make sure we look after it carefully.
Sancho
	Your Uncle Sancho, he has eseen many different espirits een hees time. But thees one, no.
Bianca
	Crikey! Did I imagine it, or did that cat just talk to us!? Maybe they learn how to do it as they get older.
Nera
	Our dog Bingo chatters away to me sometimes when we're alone, you know. He he he!
%0%a001250
	I've seen plenty of slimes now that can speak, but I've never seen a talking cat before! How sweet!
Tuppence
	Yikes! That cat must be possessed or something!
Bianca
	Who in their right mind would plan a town out to
	be this complicated? It must be an impossible place
	to live.
Bianca
	You couldn't afford to get a bit doddery on
	your feet in your old age if you lived here,
	that's for sure.
Nera
	It's so nice to be able to walk around freely, even in a place as tricky to navigate as this.
Nera
	The person who designed the town layout here must have had a whale of a time!
%0%a001240
	This place is cool! Is it a path? Is it a wall?
	Who can tell? It's like a maze!
%0%a001240
	It's pitch black and the town's made like a maze. Being in Zoomingale is like being in a cave!
%0%a001250
	This place has a sort of magical air to it, I think.
%0%a001250
	Can you look back once in a while and make sure I'm still with you, Dad? I'm worried I might get lost.
Sancho
	Thees place, ees loco! First you esee a wall, but then ees a path. Now you esee a path, but ees a dead end!
Sancho
	Ees fortunate that the inn, ees eso close to the town entrance, sí?
Tuppence
	There's no need to worry. If we get really lost,
	we can just knock a hole in the wall and tunnel
	our way out.
Tuppence
	You can see light coming through the window there, and yet what a pain it is to try and actually get there! So near and yet so far.
Bianca
	It's bin another tirin' day, eh? Maybe we should think about gettin' some sleep before long.
Nera
	I think we should call it a day today, and rest now until tomorrow.
Bianca
	It's nice to see people happy, eh?
Nera
	If anything's love, this is! My feelings for you are second to none! ...Um, or words to that effect.
%0%a001240
	Is anything bothering you at the moment, Dad?
	Or is everything okay because I'm with you?
Sancho
	Okay, friend, ees time to go!
	We no want to get een the way, uh?
Tuppence
	It doesn't look like the feeling's mutual, I have to say! Still, that's his problem, I suppose.
Bianca
	Just how long has that soldier bin lost!?
Nera
	I don't mind travelling even the most complicated and frustrating of roads as long as I'm with you.
%0%a001250
	He he he! It's funny to see that an adult
	can get lost too!
Tuppence
	That man's armour is fairly rusty. And his facial hair is totally out of control.
Tuppence
	Yep, I'd say he must've been wandering about lost for at least five years now!
Bianca
	It dun't look all that fancy to me. Still, I suppose anythin's fancy after a hay bale, eh?
Nera
	I don't have that problem. I can get to sleep in
	an instant, no matter what kind of pillow I lay
	my head on!
%0%a001240
	Big, fluffy pillows are the best in my opinion.
	But any pillow's better than a hay bale!
Bianca
	Dun't look like he's enjoyin' his sleep much there.
%0%a001250
	He looks like he's having a nightmare, poor man.
Bianca
	I doubt there's many a place you'd see a priest worse for wear like that, eh?
Nera
	Oh dear. How can a priest possibly give guidance to people when he feels like that?
%0%a001240
	If he feels that way, then why does he spend his days praying? I don't get it!
Sancho
	I, I feel esorry for thees poor padre.
	Eet hurts when you feel all alone...
Bianca
	It must be hard work tryin' to look after a drunk.
%0%a001240
	It's funny how you don't mind us coming in here.
%0%a001240
	Sancho would never let us into pubs when
	we were travelling just with him. He said
	they weren't for children.
Tuppence
	I wouldn't mind a bit of TLC from that dancing girl myself, you know!
Bianca
	That en't no rumour. We know it's the truth, eh?
Nera
	Are you alright, darling? You look a bit troubled.
%0%a001240
	What's wrong, Dad? You've gone a bit green.
%0%a001250
	I hate the idea of slavery! Anyone who turns people into slaves must be really, really wicked!
%0%a001240
	I didn't realise you were allowed to sleep over in pubs too. I'll have to remember that!
%0%a001250
	Urgh! He smells of drink!
%0%a001240
	If it's an ancient legend, then the tower must've been around a long time. I wonder when it was built.
%0%a001240
	That man works here, but his face was all red.
%0%a001240
	Does that mean people who work behind bars have to drink just like their customers?
Sancho
	Mmm... Esuch a sweet esmell...
	I wonder what kind of espirit thees ees...
%0%a001250
	He doesn't seem to be all that good...
	Or should I not say that?
Tuppence
	Hmm, it doesn't seem like the most appropriate song for a pub, does it?
Bianca
	I can see why she can't sleep with that awful
	noise comin' from next door! The pub downstairs
	en't quiet neither.
Nera
	That poor woman. There's nothing more frustrating than not being able to get to sleep.
%0%a001240
	I can sleep through anything, no matter how noisy!
%0%a001250
	I'm a bit sleepy now myself. You'd think an innkeeper would be able to get a decent night's sleep.
Bianca
	I'm surprised he can sleep in here! He dun't seem to have any ear plugs or nothin'.
Bianca
	Maybe he exhausted himself durin' the day from playin' so much. That must be it.
%0%a001240
	Looking at him snoozing like that
	makes me feel sleepy too.
Tuppence
	Fancy being able to sleep in a room like this!
	That boy will go far, you mark my words!
Bianca
	So that's the noise we've bin hearin' since we come in this buildin'! What a racket!
Nera
	He won't have any teeth left if he keeps grinding them at that rate!
%0%a001240
	What an awful noise he's making! I think I'd wake myself up if I was snoring that loudly!
Sancho
	How about me when I am esleeping? Am I making thees noise, like the castanets? When you hear esomeone else, you estart to worry...
Bianca
	I wonder how long the poor woman's had to put up with his snorin'.
Nera
	Even if you snored really loudly, I'm sure I'd be able to think of it as a lullaby sending me off to sleep...
%0%a001240
	Sancho tends to snore every now and then, but I've never heard him make that much of a racket!
Bianca
	The lucky thing! Sounds like he's really enjoyin' that.
Nera
	I always like to drink a nice glass of cold milk after I've had a bath.
%0%a001240
	I'd quite like a bath and a nice, cold juice myself!
Sancho
	Be careful, My Majesty. Thees dreenking after the bath, ees a recipe for the round estomach. And you no wanna have a round estomach, eh, friend?
Sancho
	Do you esmell that delicious escent?
	Maybe ees coming from the pot over there, no?
Tuppence
	I wonder what it is he's drinking that's so good.
	Hmm, I feel like I'm missing out here!
Bianca
	Hey! Maybe this place was built like a maze so they could protect their precious Zoomshine! Surely not!?
%0%a001240
	Adults are cheeky!
%0%a001250
	This room makes my head hurt. Can we go somewhere that doesn't smell of drink?
Tuppence
	You wouldn't have thought it would hurt to give us a little taste, given that we're in on the secret.
%0%a001250
	We're not outsiders, are we?
	That makes me feel all sad.
Tuppence
	I wonder why he's in such a state.
	Hm, it's a mystery.
Debora
	This town's like a maze. I never lose my way, but I'm a bit worried that you might, %a000090.
Debora
	I like this place. I'd like to climb up to the highest point and look down on all the people.
Debora
	I got lost here once when I was little.
Debora
	Mama and Papa were absolutely frantic that they couldn't find their beautiful little princess.
Debora
	I knew studying was bad for you. Better just to relax and keep yourself young and beautiful like me.
Debora
	What an idiot. As long as I'm alive, there's no way the world's going to come to an end.
Debora
	There's a big difference between having someone as your servant and having them as your slave. I find the latter very distasteful.
Debora
	What are you doing, buying a book like that without my permission? Remember who controls the purse strings around here!
Debora
	Quite right. You mustn't buy a book like that.
	Your possessions can speak volumes about what kind of person you are, you know.
Debora
	You only said yes because you knew we couldn't afford it. We don't need a book like that, though.
	It's pure poison, that's what it is.
Debora
	What a useless excuse for a soldier he is!
	He wouldn't be much good as a servant, either, getting lost that easily.
Debora
	Mind you, it's quite funny watching him dithering about like that.
Debora
	Yes, it's nice here because it's the highest spot.
	I can look down on the townspeople and imagine they're all my servants.
Debora
	Just so you know, you had an expression on your face just like that on the day of our wedding. Ha ha!
Debora
	He could do with a change of clothes for a start.
Debora
	He must have plenty of time on his hands to be just standing around here waiting for the place to open.
Debora
	I can't stand rowdy men like him. If you ever want to drink, %a000090, I don't mind being your partner and keeping you in check.
Debora
	They have quite a lot of decent drinks here.
Debora
	I've never drunk much myself, but I know what I'm talking about because I borrowed one of Papa's books. See, I'm studious!
Debora
	That man's lying. He can't pull the wool over my eyes that easily.
Debora
	Oh dear. I'm afraid I'm not very good at keeping things to myself. When I find out a secret, I get this urge to blurt it out to all and sundry.
Debora
	She looks quite sweet when she's asleep.
Debora
	Hmmm... Maybe not. She actually looks like she's been slapped across the face over and over! Let's go.
Debora
	I know our children won't disappoint us like that.
	And our grandchildren will call me Signorina Debora and they'll love me to pieces!
Debora
	That poor misguided man. Maybe I should show him true happiness and allow him to become one of my servants.
Debora
	Ha ha! There's no way our children will lose to the likes of Nimzo!
Debora
	That's a shame. I was looking forward to
	seeing your face if it tasted foul, but it's
	actually quite nice.
Debora
	That sounds like a fun spell! Hocus Pocus...
	You'll have to use it lots. That's an order, got it?
Debora
	Don't go forgetting your place, %a000090.
	You're my servant first and foremost.
Debora
	A precious brew that tastes just wonderful...
	I suppose I'd better save you a mouthful or
	two then.
Debora
	I always knew you were weird, but jumping down wells and chatting away with cats is pushing it even for you!
Debora
	This town's like a maze. I never lose my way, but I'm a bit worried that you might, %a000090.
Debora
	I like this place. I'd like to climb up to the highest point and look down on all the people.
Debora
	Aaaaah. I'm tired all of a sudden.
	Let's stop for a rest soon.
Debora
	You must be the happiest man alive. You married me, after all. So you'd better devote yourself to me one hundred percent, got it?
Debora
	Ugh! He smells a bit, don't you think?
	Surely he could at least find his way to the inn!
Debora
	You do have my special pillow with you, don't you?
	I can't possibly sleep without my own pillow.
Debora
	You have nightmares sometimes, don't you?
	I wonder what they're about.
Debora
	How pathetic! He's had too much to drink and he's making a show of himself.
Debora
	ⓗAgainⓘ!? So this is a regular thing?
	He needs a good talking to, he does.
Debora
	There's a big difference between having someone as your servant and having them as your slave. I find the latter very distasteful.
Debora
	I'd go and shut everyone up if it were me.
	Then I'd be able to get a good night's sleep.
Debora
	What a din! I can't bear men with such
	uncouth habits.
Debora
	You don't snore, do you?
	Not that I'd allow you to.
Debora
	There's no need for him to make quite such a meal of it. I've a good mind to take it off him.
Debora
	It is quite a frustrating place to navigate.
	I wonder if the people here ever get lost
	on their way to the shops.
Debora
	It's certainly a pleasant spot. Maybe I'll have a little snooze. You'll keep watch, won't you, %a000090?
Debora
	Ha! He thought you worked in the pub!
	Just goes to show that you look like the
	serving type, %a000090.
Debora
	Surely he doesn't mean that all of those bottles are for just one night!?
Debora
	Well, that explains it. This town is full of drunks, and that's why the streets are so manic. They designed the layout when they were squiffy.
Debora
	People say that cats start to talk when they get old, and it's true. That's so creepy.
Debora
	Come to think of it, Nera was always chattering away to our dog Bingo. I'm sure he never understood a word, though.
Debora
	I'd hate having to sleep in a place like this.
	No doubt you could've guessed that, though.
Debora
	It's sad that people want to drink something that's supposed to be so evil it frightens monsters away.
Debora
	If we manage to get hold of some, you'll have to taste it first and make sure it's good enough for me.
