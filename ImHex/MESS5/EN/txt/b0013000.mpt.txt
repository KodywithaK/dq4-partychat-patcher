	If you cross the desert west of here, you come to the queendom of Helmunaptra.

	And if you cross the ocean south-east from here, you come to King Dominicus's Dominion.
*: 
	What do you want? Come for a gander at me desert rose collection, have ya?
*: 
	Hey, I wonder how that old geezer's gettin' on. There was this bloke here a while back who said he was headin' north to build a museum or the like.

	Ruff ruff!

	Excellent. I was sent out by Mr Briscoletti on a bit of a mission, you see.

	Huuurgh-up!

	To give you this. There, I've done it now.

*: 
	Thank you. You saved my life! I'm actually a travelling salesman, you know.
*: 
	Have you heard of these desert rose things?
*: 
	That's why I'm here. I came looking for one.
	The only trouble is, I forgot my hat, and it's far
	too hot to go exploring without a hat here.
*: 
	Aaah... Will I never learn?
*: 
	They're actually rocks that are shaped like
	roses, apparently.
*: 
	Most of the time they're buried under piles of sand, but there are sandstorms in this area every night that shift the sand about.
*: 
	If you spend the night at the inn and go out looking early in the morning, you're almost guaranteed to find one lying around.
*: 
	My sister had a fight with my dad and stormed out. I think she's never coming back.
*: 
	I hope she's okay.
*: 
	A wandering minstrel such as myself has seen many places, but this castle was a complete
	surprise to me.
*: 
	The people here have wonderful tales about a legendary hero, passed down to them from their parents, and their parents' parents.
*: 
	Far in the dim and distant past, a Zenithian woman descended from the heavens.
*: 
	Her child was to become a hero.
	The saviour of the world.
*: 
	That is but one of the many folk tales about the legendary hero.
*: 
	A thousand welcomes, %H0860%Xwanderer%Ywanderers%Z of the desert.
	This is the queendom of Helmunaptra.
*: 
	Cleohatra, Queen of the Desert, embraces all visitors of the desert.
*: 
	I'm researching the legendary hero.
*: 
	It is now clear to me that he did indeed come from Zenithian blood.
*: 
	But tracing his family line beyond the hero himself is extremely difficult.
*: 
	There's really no way to find out what happened to him now.
*: 
	Long ago, one of our ancestors accompanied the legendary hero on his quest.
*: 
	When together they restored peace to the world, he settled here, and Helmunaptra was born.
*: 
	Do you know what the ancient wisdom says?
	When a plague revisits the world, the legendary
	hero shall come once more.
*: 
	Welcome, %H0860%Xtraveller%Ytravellers%Z. This is the training room of
	our warriors.
*: 
	It is written in the stars that we must guard the legendary helm.
*: 
	We must keep it safe until the legendary
	hero returns.
*: 
	Kaaah! Stand back, or be hurt!
*: 
	Practising against a mannequin might just seem like sport, but the results are deadly! Hii-yaaah!
*: 
	You may find Queen Cleohatra below, in the Garden of Tranquility.
*: 
	Queen Cleohatra foretells of a great calamity.
	A vast shadow that will once more cover the world.
*: 
	She awaits the arrival of the Great One.
*: 
	Ha ha hah! Your heart leaps in surprise to see such a beautiful garden in the middle of the desert?
*: 
	Queen Cleohatra blesses us with this paradise, more precious than beetle's blood.
*: 
	Her astounding beauty, and her eyes that
	penetrate the mysteries of the future are her
	two greatest powers.
*: 
	The flowers of the Garden of Tranquility require constant tending.
*: 
	Mummy mia! What beauty you possess!
	A jewel of the desert to rival our own!
Bianca
	Crikey! You certainly know how to flatter a girl, eh?
*: 
	The flowers of the Garden of Tranquility require constant tending.
*: 
	Mummy mia! What purity of heart I see in this young lady!
*: 
	The desert can be a harsh place for a delicate jewel. May every star in the night sky bless you
	and keep you safe.
*: 
	Travellers come here in search of desert roses.
*: 
	They are said to be found in places that once were blessed with water. In oases.
*: 
	Helmunaptra must once have been a rich and fertile land.
*: 
	Welcome to my queendom.
	I am Cleohatra, Queen of the Desert.
Queen Cleohatra
	You are here to visit the sacred grave of the legendary hero?
Queen Cleohatra
	Yes. It is meant to be. I sense a rare power
	within you.
Queen Cleohatra
	Follow me.
	I will show you.
Queen Cleohatra
	This way.
Queen Cleohatra
	The desert can be harsh to those who do not know its secrets. Rest well on your journey.
Queen Cleohatra
	You have told me you came to visit the sacred grave of the legendary hero.
Queen Cleohatra
	Though the memory of the legendary hero is lovingly enshrined here, in truth, this is not a grave.
Queen Cleohatra
	Obscurity clouds our knowledge. What happened to the hero after saving the world is a mystery.
Queen Cleohatra
	But the Zenithian Helm has been passed down through generations of Helmunaptrans.
Queen Cleohatra
	When the legendary hero appears once more, he will come in search of this helm.
Queen Cleohatra
	My ancestors built this shrine to protect it
	until that day.
Queen Cleohatra

	Though I cannot see deeply, I am blessed with the power to look into people's hearts.
Queen Cleohatra
	I believe that what I felt from you was the strength of your own desire to find the legendary hero.

	May I ask why you are so determined to find the Great One?

Queen Cleohatra
	You have inherited your father's mission to rescue your mother from Nadiria?
Queen Cleohatra
	Then your father's name was Pankraz?
Queen Cleohatra
	You come from the kingdom of Gotha, far across the ocean toward the eastern sky...
Queen Cleohatra
	The kingdom that King Pankraz left with his infant child to go in search of his kidnapped wife...
Queen Cleohatra
	Yes, I have heard many such rumours from travellers passing through my queendom.
Queen Cleohatra
	If you are the son of Pankraz, you should return to the east. To Gotha, your homeland.
Queen Cleohatra
	The hearts of men are home to many secrets.
	If you reconsider, my ears are always open.

	Though I cannot see deeply, I am blessed with the power to look into people's hearts.
Queen Cleohatra

Queen Cleohatra
	A thousand sorrows fill my heart knowing that you are not the one. The helm is not meant for you.

	Where are you, o Great One? Where?
*: 
	Have you heard of these desert rose things?
*: 
	That's why I'm here. I came looking for one.
	The only trouble is, I'm wearing a short-sleeved shirt, and it's far too cold to go exploring in that.

	What? You saw my daughter Cleo in Lodestar Harbour?
*: 
	What lies are these, you scarab!
	I have no daughter!
*: 
	I have only one child: my son here.
	A thousand curses on you for this wickedness!
*: 
	I never knew the desert was such an

	I can't understand why anyone would choose to live here.

	It's you! The legendary hero!

	Roses can take much effort to tend.

	Don't disturb me! (slurp)
*: 
	I'm training myself up to be a sooper gooper slime like the one on the roof of the castle.
*: 
	Ah-phew, ah-phew.
*: 
	Come to trade in some mini medals, have you?
*: 
	I've still only managed to collect a set of powjamas so far.
*: 
	The chocolate medalliyums here are yummy,

*: 
	Hello there! If you're looking for the bank,
	you've come to the right place!
*: 
	I keep all customer deposits very carefully indeed. Inside my own pocket, in fact!
*: 
	So relax, place your trust in me,
	and deposit away!
*: 
	How would you like to buy a chocolate medalliyum for the folks back home? It's a bargain price of only 480 gold coins!
*: 
	Nice doing business with you! I'll put it in that bag of yours there.
*: 
	Oh. You know they're very special and you can only buy them here, right? ...If you change your mind, just say the word.
*: 
	Oh dear! I'm afraid you can't afford it at the moment. Make sure you come back once you've
	saved up, though, won't you?
*: 
	Ah-phew, ah-phew...
*: 
	Haah haah... It's a tiring task for an old man like me, setting the lanterns going of a night.

	The chocolate medalliyums here are yummy,

*: 
	Eh? A rare treasure hidden in the castle, you say?
*: 
	Nope. I don't remember hearing anything about that. Why don't you try asking King Dominicus?
King Dominicus
	Hm? You wish to ask about a rare treasure hidden in my castle, my little minikin?
King Dominicus
	Hmm... I wonder if it's that puzzling little thing that suddenly appeared just the other day.
King Dominicus
	I racked my brains trying to think of a use for it, but I'm afraid the results were rather miniscule.
King Dominicus
	I had it on my throne until just recently.
	But it rather made my rear dominium sore.
King Dominicus
	The lady at the inn said she could find a use for it, so I gave it to her in the end.
King Dominicus
	Oh, I beg your pardon. My mistake.
	In that case...
*: 
	How would you like to buy a chocolate medalliyum for the folks back home? It's a bargain price of only 480 gold coins!
*: 
	Nice doing business with you! I'll put it in that bag of yours there.
*: 
	Oh. You know they're very special and you can only buy them here, right? ...If you change your mind, just say the word.
*: 
	The special thing I was given by His Majesty?
	...Oh, not that!
*: 
	I thought it would make a good paperweight, but it was so heavy I sprained my wrist when I tried to put it on a letter.
*: 
	Then I tried using it as a chopping board, but you should see the mess it made of my knife!
*: 
	No, I ended up giving that useless thing to the chap in the bank. Good riddance, I say!
*: 
	Hello there! If you're looking for the bank,
	you've come to the right place!
*: 
	I keep all customer deposits very carefully indeed. Inside my own pocket, in fact!
*: 
	So relax, place your trust in me,
	and deposit away!
*: 
	That thing I got from the woman at the inn was so solid that I thought it would make an excellent shield.
*: 
	But it was far too heavy for anyone I know to be carting around all the time!
*: 
	It was in my way in here, so I dumped it outside in the end.
~ It's a maxi medal! ~
*: 
	Ouoooze!
*: 
	S-s-slurp-somebody h-help me!
~ There seems to be a troubled voice coming from underneath. Go to the rescue? ~
*: 
	That was goosome! I thought I was going to ooze it for a minute then. Thanks for helping me out.
*: 
	I thought it would be goo for my training, you see, but I ended up getting squashed!

	We can't just leave it here. It's dangerous!

	Now I can get back to my training.

	I'm b-b-being squelched!
	Hurry up and h-h-help me!
*: 
	So that's the famous maxi medal?
*: 
	It's certainly unusual, that's for sure.
	Could be worth a fair bit, you know.
*: 
	Give me a mini medal over that any day, though. Far more portable. And pretty too. Size isn't everything, eh?
King Dominicus
	Ah! Is that my old maxi medal you have there?
King Dominicus
	I came by that a long while back now. I'm afraid I much prefer the delightful little mini medals, though.
King Dominicus
	Do feel free to keep it, won't you? Just take it far away from my dominion, if you don't mind.
King Dominicus
	Aaah... I feel a minion times better now!
	Er, let's see...
*: 
	That maxi medal just appeared out of nowhere when I was cleaning the fountain. Years and years ago it was.
*: 
	It was one of the King's treasures until he became so infatuated with mini medals. And yet look at the state of it now!
*: 
	Long ago, there was a fellow who scattered maxi medals all over the world as a kind of treasure trail.
*: 
	But he used magic to send them flying, and they ended up injuring people and damaging buildings on their way!
*: 
	They were recalled before you could say ⓗKing Dominicus's Dominionⓘ.
*: 
	It was mini medals all the way after that. You can't find the maxi ones anywhere any more.
*: 
	Haaaaaaaaa...
	Finally! Ye're finally here, are ye?

	I've been waitin' so long, I've only been an' died,
	so I have!

	I'm so old, Death's been bored stiff waitin' fer me... And I'm a knick-knackerer... So I s'pose that makes me...Old Man Nick Knack!
Old Man Nick Knack

Old Man Nick Knack

Old Man Nick Knack
	Right! Well, that settles it! Ye're just the %A0110%Xfeen%Z%B0110%Xwan%Z I've been waitin' fer. Congratulations! Ye're the new curator of the knick-knackatory!

Old Man Nick Knack
	Ye've come rollin' home with all this, have ye?
	And at yer age! 'Tis a grand collection altogether.
	Well done.
Old Man Nick Knack
	I was actually hopin' to hand the place over to someone who brought me the dream souvenir, mind.
Old Man Nick Knack
	I'd love to see it, though, that finest of souvenirs!
	'Tis hidden somewhere about in King Dominicus's Dominion, I believe.
Old Man Nick Knack
	What's that? Ye're askin' me why I don't go lookin' fer the souvenirs meself?
Old Man Nick Knack
	Haaaaaaaaa...
	Youngsters today are a cold-hearted breed, so they are.
Old Man Nick Knack
	I tried to find it, but I couldn't.
	That dream souvenir in King Dominicus's Dominion.
Old Man Nick Knack
	I tell ye, any feen that can find that treasure would be welcome to me knick-knackatory, so they would.
Old Man Nick Knack
	How's she cuttin', then?
	Have ye brought me some new souvenirs, have ye?
Old Man Nick Knack
	Well I've taken a good look through yer things, and there's nuttin' I'm remotely interested in.

	So I'd ask ye to refrain from yer rubbin' 'til after dark, when ev'ryone's out the way.
Old Man Nick Knack

	do it after hours.
Old Man Nick Knack
	Oh, 'tis %H0860%Xyerself%Yyerselves%Z! I thought I'd take on a guard, what with the exhibits bein' worth a bob or two now.

Old Man Nick Knack

Old Man Nick Knack
	Sure and there's more than one way to skin a cat, but we should be concentratin' on expandin' the collection now, not jiggin' about with the displays.
Old Man Nick Knack
	Just 'cause we're exhibitin' a few knick-knacks now doesn't mean the world 'n' his wife'll be queuin' up at the door, y'know.
Old Man Nick Knack
	It'll take a quare while fer the news to spread,
	so ye'll need to be patient.
Old Man Nick Knack
	The exhibition halls are overflowin' with desert roses. Haaa... The whole place is just one big
	desert o' roses.
Old Man Nick Knack
	The whole place is overflowin' with chocolate medalliyums.
Old Man Nick Knack
	It smells like a sweet factory in here, so it does.
	All that sugar's goin' to me head. Haaa...
Old Man Nick Knack
	The museum's stuffed to the gunwales with
	ships in bottles!
Old Man Nick Knack
	And here we are on this fine little island, the perfect place fer a souvenir shop too. Haaa... What a waste! We could've made a few bob sellin' them.
Old Man Nick Knack
	Haaa... 'Tis embarrassin' altogether callin' this place
	a museum.
Old Man Nick Knack
	ⓙTis a meagre display at best. I'd give up me halo to have more knick-knacks, so I would, but I don't s'pose that'll happen any time soon. Haaa...
Old Man Nick Knack
	Well at least we've a few more knick-knacks in the place now. But the empty pedestals still stand out like sore thumbs.
Old Man Nick Knack
	Haaa...
	I s'pose I'll be long gone before they're all in use.
	Oh, no. ⓙCourse I won't, I'm a ghost!
Old Man Nick Knack
	ⓙTis startin' to look like a real knick-knackatory now! Aye, 'tis a fine collection, so it is.
Old Man Nick Knack
	But ye've given the visitors expectations now!
	They'll be wantin' to see new displays, won't they? Be off with ye now and find sometin' fresh!
Old Man Nick Knack
	Well I'll play five on yer hive! Sure as I'm a ghost,
	the pedestals are nearly all full, are they not?
Old Man Nick Knack
	Only, I s'pose I'll have to wait 'til they're diggin' up me bones before the whole lot's taken care of. Haaa...
Old Man Nick Knack
	Well give a dog a bone! 'Tis a grand feelin' altogether to see every pedestal in use!
Old Man Nick Knack
	But this is just the beginnin'! Ye're barely playin' one on me thumb now. We need exhibits that are more valuable if the museum's to be taken seriously.
Old Man Nick Knack
	ⓙTis a shame to put such a fine article in such a dismal place as this.
Old Man Nick Knack
	Ara, be whist, Nick! I said I was leavin' it up to you now, didn't I? I shouldn't be stickin' me nose in.
Old Man Nick Knack
	Well I'll play five on yer hive! Sure as I'm a ghost,
	the pedestals are nearly all full, are they not?
Old Man Nick Knack
	Only, I s'pose I'll have to wait 'til they're diggin' up me bones before the whole lot's taken care of. Haaa...
Old Man Nick Knack
	Ye've put a fine collection together, to be sure. Only... Haaa... I don't know about the way ye've arranged things meself. I'd sooner seeⓚⓛ
Old Man Nick Knack
	No. No, no.
	I said I was leavin' it all up to you, so I did.
	So I'll leave it all up to you, so I will. Aye.
Old Man Nick Knack
	I s'pose ye're followin' some grand plan are ye, arrangin' the articles in such a way?
Old Man Nick Knack
	Haaa...
	I just don't understand what's goin' on in you young %A0110%Xfellas%Z%B0110%Xwans%Z' heads sometimes.
Old Man Nick Knack
	I don't like to say anytin', but...
	Well, the exhibition halls are really startin' to take shape now, ye know.
Old Man Nick Knack
	Only, I'd rather see articles befittin' the room they're displayed in, if ye don't mind me sayin'.
Old Man Nick Knack
	That's grand! We've more 'n' more visitors all the time. But a knick-knackerer never stops fiddlin', y'know. 'Tis what we do.
Old Man Nick Knack
	So let this ole paddywhack give y'a bone and tell ye that ye can attract different folk by puttin' different articles on display.
Old Man Nick Knack
	Go on, give it a try. Switch a few articles around and wait a while. Ye'll soon see different types o' feens turnin' up.
Old Man Nick Knack
	I've a fair few things I'd like ye to sort out, but everyone looks like they're havin' a grand craic here.
Old Man Nick Knack
	So I'll turn a blind eye to the little niggles fer now.
Old Man Nick Knack
	The way ye've arranged the articles in this museum is desperate altogether, ye daft maggot!
Old Man Nick Knack
	What theⓚⓛ
	Did I just burst out with sometin' then, did I?
	I'm sure I probably didn't mean it, whatever it was.
Old Man Nick Knack
	ⓙTis some grand weather we're havin', isn't it?
	Even fer a dead fella like meself, 'tis nice to
	warm yer bones.
Old Man Nick Knack
	Ye really ought to get out in the sun yerself sometimes, ye know.
Old Man Nick Knack
	All the visitors look like they're havin' a whale of a time. They'll all go rollin' home happy.
Old Man Nick Knack
	Everyone seems mighty pleased at havin' the opportunity to see such a rare collection of
	peculiar articles, so they do.
Old Man Nick Knack
	Ye've done a grand job, so ye have.
Old Man Nick Knack
	I'll be honest with ye, I never thought ye'd make such a go of it. Ye've played nine on me spine, so ye have. I'm gobsmacked.
Sue Veneer
	Mr Knack's written me a little note about the sort of exhibits he's hopin' to see in the museum.
Sue Veneer
	Accordin' to what he's written, there's a sort of ratin' that goes with every article.
Sue Veneer
	I think Mr Knack's expectin' the articles on display on the second and third levels to reflect the grandeur of their settin' to some extent.
Sue Veneer
	Anyway, if ye'd like to look at what he's written any time, just give me a nod.
Sue Veneer
	Mr Knack's after addin' a little amendment to his notes about the museum exhibits.
Sue Veneer
	It seems he's discovered sometin' about some new articles we could be displayin'.
Sue Veneer
	Would ye like to see Mr Knack's notes now,
	would ye?
~ (DISPLAY KNICK-KNACK LIST) ~
Sue Veneer
	Would ye like me to fill ye in on some o' the articles ye've yet to find?
Sue Veneer
	And what article in particular are ye interested in?
Sue Veneer
	Is there another article ye'd like to
	know about, perhaps?
Sue Veneer
	Well I'm always here if there's sometin' ye'd like to know. Me interest in knick-knacks isn't just a veneer, y'know. 'Tis ever sue deep!
Sue Veneer
	Aye, well. Ye've collected every article there is to collect, haven't ye?
Sue Veneer
	It'll be me askin' you about things from now on
	I s'pose, won't it?
