Bianca
	Blimey! This certainly takes me back. The folk here might be different to before, but the place en't changed a bit.
Bianca
	My family en't around here any more, but it's still nice to be back for a while.
Nera
	There's a really nice, friendly atmosphere here.
	What a lovely town!
Nera
	Bianca would probably love to make a trip
	back here every once in a while. It's quite
	a way from Stockenbarrel.
%0%a001240
	I remember coming here before with Sancho.
	The inn here's really big.
%0%a001250
	Look, Dad! Aren't the flowers at the church pretty?
Sancho
	I remember eet eso well. We came here weeth señor Pankraz. And that time, señora Bianca's family, they were here also.
Sancho
	Sí. The times, they change, you know.
	Ees notheeng you can do to estop eet.
Bianca
	Thanks, %a000090. It means a lot that you've brought me here before we head into our final battle.
%0%a001250
	I really love Roundbeck!
	I don't know why, but I just do!
Sancho
	You have many memories from thees place, eh, friend? Sí. Your Uncle Sancho, he has many memories from here too.
%0%a001240
	Do you think there'll ever be a world without weapons? It would be nice if there could be.
Sancho
	Thees señor, he no look eso happy, even though he esells everytheeng een hees eshop. Sí, I understand how he feels eso well.
Bianca
	En't he the bloke who did a runner from Coburg all them years back? Sounds like he's plannin' on doin' the same kind of thing again!
Nera
	The people are just like in so many other places.
	They don't seem to realise the true nature of the Order of Zugzwang.
Sancho
	Ees estrange, no, these theengs people are esaying?
Sancho
	Eef thees Order of Zugzwang ees gonna esave people from the Grandmaster of the Underworld,
	eet means they are connected, no?
Tuppence
	Yep. I'm all for protecting myself by myself. Er, after I've protected you, of course, %a000090!
Bianca
	Crikey! He's the kid who was bullyin' %a001210 all them years ago! He looks really middle-aged now!
%0%a001240
	This is where you rescued %a001210 from being bullied, isn't it, Dad?
%0%a001240
	I wonder if we might find another great sabrecat around the place. I wouldn't mind having one of
	my own.
Sancho
	I no want to theenk about thees time.
	Eet was a bad time.
Tuppence
	Um... Why are you looking at me like that, %a000090?
Bianca
	I wonder what he'd do if he actually did meet him. Challenge him to an arm wrestlin' match or the like?
%0%a001240
	Can you not tell that man about me, Dad? I reckon he'd probably make way too much of a fuss.
Bianca
	I really remember this garden and this pond.
	Bein' here makes me think about all the happy
	times with Mum.
%0%a001240
	Mt Azimuth is the highest mountain in the world, you know. I know these things!
Bianca
	Who would've thought that you're part of
	that bloodline, eh? And that I've got the
	blood of a Zenithian!
Nera
	The reason our son is the legendary hero is probably because your special bloodline mixed with my Zenithian heritage. It must be.
%0%a001240
	Do you think this clan of people guarding the seal
	to Nadiria are famous? I feel like I've heard of them somewhere before.
%0%a001250
	I can understand a bit of what monsters say, you know. Most of them are good, not evil.
Bianca
	I en't cooked a meal in as long as I can remember.
	I'll have to make up for it once things are back to normal again.
Nera
	Do you think that she cooks all day long just to forget about what's going on?
Tuppence
	My mother is more than just a whizz in the kitchen. She always kept the inn nice and tidy too. It must be hard work.
Bianca
	This takes me back. The old place has aged a bit, but it's good to see them keepin' it nice.
Nera
	I can't help thinking about Bianca all the time whenever we're here.
%0%a001240
	The rooms in this inn are really big. It's cool!
Sancho
	You know, being here een thees place like thees, I theenk the young señorita Bianca, eshe gonna come running around the corner any minute.
Bianca
	What a great smell! How funny that Mum's grapes ended up bein' Roundbeck's big local speciality!
Nera
	That smell relaxes you in an instant. I think it could send me to sleep right in the middle of the day!
%0%a001240
	Wow! It smells of grapes!
	I wonder if it's all sticky...
Tuppence
	It smells so good that I'm afraid I might forget myself during my sleep and gobble it up!
Bianca
	I can't believe she's a follower of the Order of Zugzwang. And it dun't look like business is
	good, neither. I hope she's okay.
Nera
	Oh dear. I'm surprised to hear the Order of Zugzwang's influence has made it here as well.
%0%a001250
	That woman was really nice to us when we came here with Sancho. She didn't mention anything about Zugzwang then.
Sancho
	I no like to tell you thees, but even een Gotha, there are esome people who believe een thees Order of Zugzwang, you know.
Tuppence
	Dear me. A colleague of mine was giving all of
	his earnings to the Order of Zugzwang as well.
	What a fool!
Bianca
	Comin' here reminds me of all those times you and I used to play hide-and-seek together, %a000090.
%0%a001240
	Why does %a001250 always spend so long in the bath? I'm in and out like a flash.
%0%a001250
	I really like this inn. The beds are soft, they have a bath, and the whole place smells really good.
Tuppence
	It's interesting to see all the different types of inns dotted around the world.
Tuppence
	Maybe I'll set up an inn of my own one day.
	Once I've found myself a lovely wife to set
	it up with, of course.
Bianca
	It's a shame you never got to try any of
	Mum's grapes.
Nera
	You must have a lot of memories of this place, %a000090. I can't help feeling a little bit jealous.
%0%a001240
	Did you stay in this room with Grandpa, Dad?
	I wish I'd been there.
Sancho
	When we used to come to Roundbeck, we always estayed een thees, the beeggest room,
	you know. You remember that?
Bianca
	No way! She used to be a bunny girl! Yikes!
%0%a001240
	Am I really a ⓗyoung manⓘ? That sounds all grown-up!
Tuppence
	It's nice of her to call me a young man and everything, but she's not exactly my type.
Bianca
	I would never have expected him to know anythin' about the legendary hero, what with him always bein' three sheets to the wind.
Bianca
	Mind you, he dun't know as much about him as
	we do, eh?
Nera
	Imagine how surprised he'd be to find out that the legendary hero is actually %a001240!
%0%a001240
	Es-something? But wasn't he defeated long ago?
Tuppence
	This Es-something-or-other has a bit of a convoluted name, doesn't he?
Bianca
	Blimey! This certainly takes me back. The folk here might be different to before, but the place en't changed a bit.
Bianca
	My family en't around here any more, but it's still nice to be back for a while.
Nera
	There's a really nice, friendly atmosphere here.
	What a lovely town!
Nera
	Bianca would probably love to make a trip
	back here every once in a while. It's quite
	a way from Stockenbarrel.
%0%a001240
	I remember coming here before with Sancho.
	The inn here's really big.
%0%a001250
	Aaaah! Um, no, I'm not sleepy.
	I wasn't yawning, honest.
Sancho
	I remember eet eso well. We came here weeth señor Pankraz. And that time, señora Bianca's family, they were here also.
Sancho
	Sí. The times, they change, you know.
	Ees notheeng you can do to estop eet.
%0%a001240
	Do you think there'll ever be a world without weapons? It would be nice if there could be.
Sancho
	Thees señor, he no looks eso happy, even though he esells everytheeng een hees eshop. Sí, I understand how he feels eso well.
%0%a001240
	I'll always be your little boy, won't I? I don't really get what that woman's on about.
Sancho
	Sí. The leettle friends, they grow up eso fast.
	Ees no eso long ago that %a001240 and %a001250, they were esmall like mosquitoes.
%0%a001240
	Do you think everyone in this house is all part of the same family? Big families are fun!
%0%a001250
	Are you okay, Dad? I'm right by your side if that makes you feel any better.
%0%a001240
	Mt Azimuth is the highest mountain in the world, you know. I know these things!
Bianca
	No way! She used to be a bunny girl! Yikes!
%0%a001240

	Es-something? But wasn't he defeated long ago?
Tuppence
	This Es-something-or-other has a bit of a convoluted name, doesn't he?
Bianca
	Ha ha! Well, one out of two ain't bad, eh?
%0%a001240
	Is alcohol really that tasty? Just smelling it is enough to make me feel ill.
Sancho
	I no dreenk anytheeng for esuch a long time now. One piña colada now, and I no gonna be able to hold back the tears.
Bianca
	It's nice to see how happy the Count and Countess are now.
Nera
	Er...d-d-darling... That man's shadow seems
	r-r-rather light. He's not a g-g-ghost, is he?
Nera
	Oh! Oh dear! I feel all woozy! Can you hold onto me in case I faint?
Nera
	V-Very well. If you're sure.
%0%a001250
	That woman's really nice. Can we stay here
	a bit longer?
Sancho
	But look at all these espirits! Why does
	señor Pankraz no appear for me?
Tuppence
	Waaah! Ghosts!
Bianca
	The Order of Zugzwang!? Then they must've bin at the temple that time. I hope they're alright.
Nera
	I'm sorry, darling. I'm just finding it hard to have a conversation with a ghost.
%0%a001240
	I'm not scared of ghosts if they're all like him!
%0%a001250
	The Count wants us to help him. What's this tea set he's on about, though? Do you think it's here in the castle somewhere?
Sancho
	Uf. Thees count, hees esoul can no rest, eh?
Tuppence
	Waaah! Ghosts!
Bianca
	The Order of Zugzwang!? Then they must've bin at the temple that time. I hope they're alright.
Nera
	I'm sorry, darling. I'm just finding it hard to have a conversation with a ghost.
%0%a001240
	It's not our fault. It was already in a bad state when we found it.
%0%a001250
	Is there no way we can make the tea set all nice again for him, Dad?
Sancho
	There was a fine tea set een Gotha a long, long time ago.
Sancho
	I no remember what happened to eet now.
	Maybe esomeone, they broke eet? Sí...
	Maybe eet was your clumsy Uncle Sancho...
Tuppence
	Waaah! Ghosts!
Bianca
	The Order of Zugzwang!? Then they must've bin at the temple that time. I hope they're alright.
Nera
	I'm sorry, darling. I'm just finding it hard to have a conversation with a ghost.
%0%a001240
	I'm not scared of ghosts if they're all like him!
%0%a001250
	The Count wants us to help him. What's this tea set he's on about, though? Do you think it's here in the castle somewhere?
Sancho
	Uf. Thees count, hees esoul can no rest, eh?
Tuppence
	Waaah! Ghosts!
Bianca
	Do you think it's really okay for us to get hold of a crown like this? I dun't feel worthy!
Nera
	A p-p-present from a ghost. How l-lovely...
%0%a001240
	(sniff sniff)
%0%a001240
	It's okay! I was thinking it might be a bit stinky because it's so old, but it's actually not too bad.
%0%a001250
	Don't give that crown to me, will you? I'm worried
	I'll stop growing if I wear something too heavy on
	my head.
Sancho
	Uf! Ees a fine article, eh, friend?
	You must look after eet, okay?
Tuppence
	Waaah! Ghosts!
Bianca
	It's funny seein' the flash of light when he's angry
	at you sayin' no! Takes me back to the last time we met him!
%0%a001240
	Did the Count make that flash of light? It's a bit
	mean of him to do that just because he didn't like
	our answer.
%0%a001250
	That tea set used to belong here in the castle, right? But now it's got into a bad way.
%0%a001250
	I thought you were supposed to keep precious things like that safe, though. Don't all adults know that?
Tuppence
	Waaah! Ghosts!
Bianca
	Well, we can hardly accept responsibility for that now, can we?
Nera
	What a shame they've been disappointed!
%0%a001240
	It must be a bit rubbish being dead. I'll have to be careful it doesn't happen to me.
%0%a001250
	Don't the Count and Countess need to go and be
	with the Goddess? Or are they just going to stay here forever?
Tuppence
	You can't taste anything when you're dead? How tiresome! I'll have to make sure I eat and drink as many delicious things as I can while I'm alive, then.
Bianca
	Fancy comin' back here! Dun't you worry, though.
Bianca
	I still en't forgotten how good it was to come explorin' here with you when we were kids.
Nera
	If there was a castle like this near Mostroferrato, I know I would've had to explore it when I was little.
Nera
	Oops! I'd better not let the children hear me say things like that.
%0%a001240
	Do you know this place, Dad? That's cool! Maybe I should go off adventuring of a night too!
Bianca
	Oi! I dun't think so! Your dad and I only came here adventurin' for good reason, I'll have you know.
%0%a001240
	Huh!
%0%a001250
	I can hear the little birds singing. They're saying that all is well here at the castle now.
Sancho
	I no believe you and Bianca, you went out of the town alone like thees all those years ago, friend.
Sancho
	But ees okay. Ees no esometheeng to be angry about now. Ees too long ago. And you are no the boy you were then.
Sancho
	I never came to thees place weeth señor Pankraz. I believed ees just an old ruin.
Tuppence
	Are there ghosts here?
Tuppence
	I suppose I'd consider a beautiful female ghost if I had to. You can't accuse me of being closed-minded.
Bianca
	I reckon it was the bad ghosts that made it so scary last time. Walkin' around now, even of a night, dun't scare me at all.
Nera
	You and Bianca came adventuring here in the middle of the night once, didn't you? I wish I'd been there.
%0%a001240
	I reckon %a001250 and I are big and brave enough to explore somewhere like this on our own!
%0%a001250
	When you were here as a boy, there were lots of evil ghosts, weren't there? How scary!
Sancho
	You and Bianca, you came here to thees place een the middle of the night, sí? When you were just a leettle boy.
Sancho
	You know, I believed you were a well-behaved young boy, but no. You are truly the eson of señor Pankraz. I, I am eso happy!
Tuppence
	Brrr... There's a bit of a chill in the air here. Oh...
	I'm the only one feeling it, am I?
Bianca
	I can't sense anything sinister here now.
	That's a relief.
%0%a001240
	It'd be really fun to come exploring here just with kids of my own age.
Bianca
	The place looks a bit tidier than the last time
	we came, eh? Maybe those two lovebirds
	fixed it up a bit.
Bianca
	We did a good job of rescuin' %a001210 by comin' here all those years back. I couldn't have done it without you, %a000090.
Nera
	Old buildings always have a certain smell to them. Maybe it's just mould, I don't know. But it's not a
	bad smell.
Nera
	I can't imagine how worried I'd be at the thought of %a001240 and %a001250 here all alone.
Nera
	You'd be worried too, right? That's probably just how Pankraz felt when you came here as a boy.
%0%a001240
	Are all the bad ghosts gone now? If I see any, I'll soon send them packing!
%0%a001240
	Look! There's a huge spider's web up there. Wow!
	It looks amazing.
%0%a001240
	We don't have any ghosts in Gotha.
	It would be fun if we did.
%0%a001240
	I reckon I could stay undiscovered here for ages if we had a game of hide-and-seek.
%0%a001250
	This castle's not scary. Not now all the nasty ghosts have gone away.
%0%a001250
	There are so many stairs and corridors here.
	I'm worried I'm going to get lost.
%0%a001250
	You did well here, Dad. The people seem really grateful to you.
%0%a001250
	My favourite castle of all is Gotha, of course. That's where all my friends are. And it's much warmer than here too.
Sancho
	You no theenk ees a really beeg castle?
	Ees like a giant paella. Ees a waste
	to leave eet.
Sancho
	To restore thees castle to eets former glory, ees gonna take muchos, muchos time, eh?
	Sí. Many, many years.
Tuppence
	Tuppence Castle... No, not grand enough. Great Tuppence Castle? Hmm... I know! I could call it Tupptaten Towers!
Tuppence
	Sorry! I was just trying to figure out what name I'll give my castle in the future.
Tuppence
	Watch where you're walking, won't you, %a000090? The floorboards might be a bit weak in places.
Debora
	It's a bit of a small town, but it has a few shops, so it's not so bad.
Debora
	If there are things you need to do here, that's fair enough, but if this is just a trip down memory lane, you'll have to wait until it's all over.
Debora
	People like him are always the first to do a runner when the going gets tough.
Debora
	He was lucky to be forgiven if he deserted the army! The ruler of Coburg must be a more lenient soul than I am.
Tuppence
	Er, wh-why are you looking at me when you say that? I have n-no intention of deserting.
Debora
	I should think he'd be a bit overwhelmed if we told him about your bloodline and about me being descended from the Zenithians.
Debora
	I don't need to bother myself with cooking.
	That's what people have chefs for.
%0%a001240
	Can't you cook at all, Mum? I'd love to taste a homemade dish of yours, even just the once.
Debora
	Of course I can cook! I suppose I could make you something one day if you really want me to.
~ Debora gives %a000090 a meaningful glance. ~
~ It seems that he's going to be the one doing the cooking... ~
Debora
	This inn is where Bianca lived as a little girl, isn't it? It's a bit common for my tastes, but it could be worse, I suppose.
Debora
	It smells quite nice. Could be the perfect accompaniment to a nice afternoon siesta.
Debora
	So she's a follower of the Order of Zugzwang?
	Hmm... We might've defeated Korol, but there are still believers like her dotted about the place.
Debora
	This inn must be full of memories from your younger years, %a000090.
Debora
	I wonder how he'd react if we told him %a001240 was the legendary hero. Not that I'm planning on finding out.
Debora
	It's getting late now. Maybe we should stay here for the night. Hurry up and find us a room!
Debora
	If there are things you need to do here, that's fair enough, but if this is just a trip down memory lane, you'll have to wait until it's all over.
Debora
	I wonder how he'd react if we told him %a001240 was the legendary hero. Not that I'm planning on finding out.
Debora
	I couldn't quite seem to focus on that woman properly. I must be tired or something.
Debora
	So many people have been taken in by the Order of Zugzwang. I just don't understand it.
Debora
	So many people have been taken in by the Order of Zugzwang. I just don't understand it.
Debora
	So many people have been taken in by the Order of Zugzwang. I just don't understand it.
Debora
	You don't think that wearing that crown makes you transparent or anything, do you? No, surely not...
Debora
	What's going on with all this lightning?
	It keeps giving me a fright.
Debora
	It must be terrible not being able to taste anything. Even money can't buy taste.
Debora
	What are we doing at this stinky old castle?
	Let's hurry up and leave.
Debora
	Is it me, or has it suddenly gone cold?
Debora
	It's nicer in here than I thought. I wouldn't want to live here, though. Far too old-fashioned.
Tuppence
	It's quite a lively little town considering its size.
	If only there were a few more beauties about
	for me to enjoy.
Debora
	I beg your pardon, Tuppence! Is it not enough to be accompanied by a beauty such as I?
Tuppence
	Er, I, er, yes! Yes, of course.
	More than enough!
