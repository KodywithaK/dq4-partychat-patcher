Bianca
	We come here not long after we was married, eh, %a000090? You remember, right?
Nera
	I found the heat here almost intolerable before, but it's not too bad this time.
Nera
	My happiness at being with you all again is obviously taking my mind off it.
%0%a001240
	It's hard work walking on the sand.
	My feet are killing me.
%0%a001240
	What's such a huge castle doing stuck out here in the middle of the desert? Do you know, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I'm worried I might shrivel up and die if I don't find some shade soon.
%0%a001250
	I'd be much happier if I could wait in the wagon.
	Can I, Dad? Please!
Sancho
	You no theenk we eshould find esome eshade?
	Your Uncle Sancho, he, he can no estand thees heat much longer.
Sancho
	I would die for esome cold water now.
	I would dive eento the cold esea now.
	I would definitely esay sí to the siesta now!
Sancho
	When I travel weeth señor Pankraz, he no breeng me to esuch a place like thees. Ees too much!
Tuppence
	It really is unbearably hot here. What I'd give to be standing in the snow on Mt Batten!
Tuppence
	Ouch! I have sand in my eyes!
	I'm afraid we'll have to chat later.
%0%a001240
	I wonder where the water can be coming from,
	all the way out here in the desert. It's a welcome sight, though.
%0%a001250
	I've read about oases, and that definitely looks like one. An oasis is an area of greenery in the middle of a desert, you see.
%0%a001240
	Aaah! What a relief to be out of the sun.
%0%a001250
	I wish we didn't have to go outside again.
Tuppence
	There's a fair amount of sand in here, isn't there?
	I suppose it can't be helped in a place like this.
%0%a001240
	I was happy just like him when you came home
	again, Dad.
%0%a001250
	You won't go missing again, will you, Dad?
Sancho
	Sí, sí. Ees the best when the whole family, they are together. Sí, sí...sí... (sob)
Tuppence
	A spa town? How nice. I should take my old mother to a spa one of these days.
%0%a001240
	Her youth's fading away... Does that make her about the same age as Sancho, then?
Tuppence
	If only I'd been able to meet that lovely lady before the years had taken their toll.
Tuppence
	It's always rather fascinating to meet a woman with a past.
%0%a001250
	I love seeing the colours of the sky change at sunset and sunrise. It's so pretty!
%0%a001240
	I managed to equip the Zenithian Sword, so does
	that make me the hero? I'm a bit confused. I don't really get it.
Bianca
	Makes you wonder why people are sayin' that all of a sudden, eh? Rumours are funny old things.
%0%a001250
	That man had such a nice voice! Yours is nice too, Dad, but his is something really special.
Tuppence
	The time of the legendary hero may be upon us now, but I wonder if the time of Tuppence will ever come to pass.
Tuppence
	I mean, I am the chosen soldier accompanying the hero on his quest, after all. Surely that deserves some recognition.
%0%a001240
	So he'd forgotten his hat the last time you saw
	him too? You'd think he'd know better after all
	these years!
Tuppence
	There are some scatterbrained folk about, aren't there? I'm not at all...um...scatterbrained, of course.
%0%a001250
	I've seen pictures of desert roses in books before. They're really pretty.
%0%a001240
	Um... So does that mean Mum's a Zenithian?
Bianca
	I'm sure my mum and dad were just regular folk, though. Maybe the hero just comes out of nowhere.
Nera
	That means that one of my real parents must have had the blood of a Zenithian.
Nera
	Maybe that's why our family had the Zenithian Shield.
Tuppence
	So, if I marry that Zenithian woman in Gotha, maybe I'll become the father of the legendary hero!
Tuppence
	Hmph. No doubt my bloodline still wouldn't be good enough, though, even if my wife was a Zenithian.
%0%a001240
	Um, Dad... I don't smell, do I?
%0%a001250
	It's so nice and cool in here! Even the walls are cold to the touch.
Tuppence
	Cleohatra, Queen of the Desert...
	I'll have to jot that down so I don't forget!
%0%a001250
	So women can rule over places too? It's probably quite hard work, though.
Bianca
	Well, that's a relief. We could do with a break from the heat, eh?
%0%a001240
	The legendary hero can't be born of the blood of a Zenithian alone. He needs the blood of another...
%0%a001240
	Hey! How did I know that!?
%0%a001250
	Ooh! This place is brilliant. Look at all the books!
Sancho
	Everyone ees talking about the legendary hero.
	Ees a leettle estrange, thees place, eh?
Tuppence
	That sounds just like my situation! Maybe I'll settle somewhere and build my own kingdom too!
%0%a001240
	How long ago do you think she means? When you were a boy, Dad? Or ages and ages ago, when Sancho was?
%0%a001250
	I can't understand why he would've wanted to settle here, of all places. It's just so hot!
%0%a001240
	How come Queen Cleohatra can see into the future? She's a bit strange, isn't she?
%0%a001250
	It's just like Queen Cleohatra said. It's amazing how she knows these things.
Tuppence
	A truly beautiful woman needs to have a certain air of mystery to her.
Tuppence
	Queen Cleohatra has got that down to a T!
%0%a001250
	Did you marry Mum because she's pretty, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Hmm. I thought so.
%0%a001250
	You chose her because of her personality?
	How romantic!
Sancho
	Anda! I no believe the esoldiers, they can practise een eso much heat like thees.
	I esweat just to look at them!
Sancho
	Friend! Ees dangerous!
	You no go eso close!
Bianca
	He's enthusiastic, I'll give him that. But fightin' against a mannequin en't goin' to be of any
	use to him in a real battle.
%0%a001250
	That poor doll! It's taking such a beating, even though it hasn't done a thing to deserve it.
Sancho
	No! Hahh... Ees no fair!
	I puff all the way up ⓚⓛ hahh ⓚⓛ thees estairs, but ees no the right way!
Bianca
	Oh yeah. It's bin a while since we was last here, so I'd forgotten that's her favourite haunt.
%0%a001240
	It's funny seeing a throne room all empty like this. Does the Queen never sit in here?
Nera
	That garden is really beautiful. I can understand why she'd want to spend all her time in it.
Tuppence
	They're rather delightful, these assistants to the Queen. Quite lovely, in fact!
%0%a001250
	Queen Cleohatra knows everything! If only I could see into the future too. Then I'd be of much more use to you.
Sancho
	Thees eshadow, you theenk ees the esame evil that ees behind the death of señor Pankraz?
Sancho
	Then we can no wait no more!
	We must meet weeth thees queen, friend.
	Now!
Bianca
	The smell of the grass and the water is so strong! This place is always really relaxin', eh?
%0%a001240
	Wow! Look at all the water and flowers! I never expected something like this inside a castle!
%0%a001250
	I can't believe they have so many lovely flowers inside the castle like this!
Nera
	What a yummy smell. It really is something special, finding a place like this in the middle of the desert.
Tuppence
	Goodness! It's like magic. Who would've thought such a beautiful garden could thrive like this in a desert?
%0%a001240
	Beetle's blood? I never knew that was precious.
%0%a001240
	I'd say this garden must be a million times more precious than that!
Sancho
	But eshe can no be eso beautiful like señora %a001230, eh, friend?
Sancho
	And I no believe any señora, eshe could ever be more beautiful than señora Mada.
Tuppence
	Ooh! Look at that bed over there. Perhaps it belongs to Queen Cleohatra...aaah.
Bianca
	It's pretty hard work keepin' plants goin' indoors like this, you know.
Bianca
	And yet they always seem to manage to have the place lookin' so nice.
Nera
	Oh no! We don't want to forget about our
	monsters! You'd better not look at the
	flowers too much, darling.
%0%a001240
	If they had their flower beds outside, they'd probably get destroyed by monsters. That
	must be why they have them in here.
Sancho
	Sí. Ees a very well-kept garden. The flowers, they are eso beautiful. I, I...
	No! I no gonna cry!
%0%a001250
	It's hard to imagine a time when the castle would've been surrounded by greenery instead of sand.
Sancho
	You theenk thees means that the places where ees green now, they can one day become like the desert?
Bianca
	It's amazin' how she knew about %a001240 even though he's not with us!
%0%a001250
	So she wants to meet %a001240? We should go and bring him to her, then.
Tuppence
	Such a beautiful woman, and yet she only has eyes for the boy. What a waste.
Nera
	We should go and fetch %a001240. The fact that he was able to equip the Zenithian Sword should speak volumes.
Bianca
	That helmet...
Nera
	That's the...
%0%a001240
	We've finally found it!
	It's mine, isn't it, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Hahh, hahh... Sorry, I'm a bit tired.
	You all walk so fast.
Tuppence
	If only Her Majesty and I could have some moments here alone...
Tuppence
	I wouldn't mind trying it on myself before %a001240 has a go, but I suppose that wouldn't be the done thing.
%0%a001240
	Yay! It's exactly my size!
Nera
	Well! Goodness! I don't know what to say. Does this mean %a001240's the one? That I gave birth to the legendary hero?
Bianca
	I still had my doubts even though he managed to equip the Zenithian Sword, but now it looks like %a001240 really is the hero.
%0%a001250
	%0%a001240's still just %a001240 to me. Just because he's the hero, that doesn't mean he's not my brother any more.
Sancho
	I... I, I no know what to esay!
	When I theenk back now, there were many esigns, but, but...ees a miracle!
%0%a001240
	Brrr! It's c-c-cold in the desert of a night, isn't it?
%0%a001250
	It's so dark and quiet in the desert at night.
	Far too eerie for my liking.
Sancho
	Ees dangerous to estay outside een the desert eso late een the night.
Sancho
	We go to the inn and espend the night there, okay?
Tuppence
	Ouch! I have sand in my eyes!
	I'm afraid we'll have to chat later.
Bianca
	It feels like a dream, bein' able to visit places like this with you again.
Nera
	Suffering this cold is nothing compared to the agony I was in during all those years I was away from you and the children.
%0%a001240
	Looks like we can't do anything of a night.
	I'm pretty tired now, anyhow.
%0%a001250
	(yawn) I'm fine. I'm not...sleepy...at all yet. 
Sancho
	You no remember what your Uncle Sancho always tell you, friend? You always visit people een the daylight hours.
Bianca
	It's not just cold, it's blimmin' freezin'! We should rest for the night before we freeze our whatsits off.
Nera
	Dear me. I hope that nun's feeling alright.
%0%a001240
	She's right! Look, Dad! The moon's reflected in the water. It looks amazing.
%0%a001250
	It's a welcome sight during the day, but I bet the water in there is as cold as ice at night.
Tuppence
	What a pity I didn't have the opportunity to meet her during her dancing days.
Nera
	I remember him... But he was only a young boy the last time we saw him. It just goes to show how time's moved on.
Bianca
	He was just a lad the last time we was here! It's funny to think how time only stood still for you and me durin' them years we spent as statues.
Nera
	He may sound angry, but I'm sure it's all just talk. It's good that they're on the road to making up.
Sancho
	Sí, sí. Ees the best when the whole family, they are together. Sí, sí...sí... (sob)
%0%a001240
	Yeah, the desert's a pretty tough place, but I like it. It's a bit different to everywhere else.
%0%a001250
	Each to their own, I s'pose. They must like the place, otherwise they wouldn't stay.
Tuppence
	I must admit that I'm not overly partial to the desert myself. Naturally, though, I'd venture anywhere you wished me to, Your Majesty.
Sancho
	No, friend. Ees no good to wake up people when they are esleeping. The esleep, ees very important, you know.
%0%a001240
	That man's funny! He says funny things in his sleep.
%0%a001240
	So he was like that the last time you met him?
	Sounds like he's been in a tizz for quite a few
	years now, then.
%0%a001250
	I've seen pictures of desert roses in books before. They're really pretty.
Bianca
	Well, we've got the Zenithian Helm now.
	It's time we moved on.
Nera
	I found the heat here almost intolerable before,
	but it's not too bad this time.
Nera
	My happiness at being with you all again is obviously taking my mind off it.
%0%a001240
	So the people of Helmunaptra have all been waiting for me to turn up? I feel all embarrassed now!
%0%a001240
	It's strange, but I felt a sort of connection with the Zenithian Helm when I saw it.
%0%a001240
	It was like I'd seen it somewhere before, and yet I knew it was only the first time.
%0%a001250
	Everyone here goes on about %a001240 all the time. I'm starting to find it a bit boring.
%0%a001250
	It's just so hot here!
	It's starting to make me feel dizzy.
Sancho
	Now we can be esure thees esword that señor Pankraz, he found, ees the real theeng, sí? The Zenithian Sword.
Sancho
	Sí, sí. Ees good to know.
Sancho
	Just estanding up een thees place, ees enough to make room for mucha paella!
Tuppence
	It really is unbearably hot here. What I'd give to be standing in the snow on Mt Batten!
Tuppence
	So %a001240 really is the one. Which makes me the companion of the legendary hero!
%0%a001240
	I wonder where the water can be coming from,
	all the way out here in the desert. It's a welcome sight, though.
%0%a001250
	I've read about oases, and that definitely looks like one. An oasis is an area of greenery in the middle of a desert, you see.
%0%a001240
	Aaah! What a relief to be out of the sun.
%0%a001250
	I wish we didn't have to go outside again.
Tuppence
	There's a fair amount of sand in here, isn't there?
	I suppose it can't be helped in a place like this.
%0%a001240
	I was happy just like him when you came home
	again, Dad.
%0%a001250
	You won't go missing again, will you, Dad?
Sancho
	Sí, sí. Ees the best when the whole family, they are together. Sí, sí...sí... (sob)
Tuppence
	A spa town? How nice. I should take my old mother to a spa one of these days.
%0%a001240
	Her youth's fading away... Does that make her about the same age as Sancho, then?
Tuppence
	If only I'd been able to meet that lovely lady before the years had taken their toll.
Tuppence
	It's always rather fascinating to meet a woman with a past.
%0%a001250
	I love seeing the colours of the sky change at sunset and sunrise. It's so pretty!
%0%a001250
	%0%a001240's really popular around here, isn't he? It doesn't seem fair in a way. I mean, we're twins, so what makes him so much better than me?
Tuppence
	I do hope I become a man of legend one of
	these days.
%0%a001240
	Ⓠ My mighty hero! Ⓡ Le-gend-a-ry hero! Ⓠ
	Ⓠ You know... Um...
%0%a001240
	I can't remember the rest of the words.
%0%a001250
	Hmph. It's all about %a001240.
	I want my own song too!
Sancho
	No. I esorry, friend, but I can no understand
	your tastes.
Bianca
	Oh! Did you not think that was any good, %a000090?
%0%a001240
	I think it's a good song. Didn't you like it, Dad?
	How funny!
Tuppence
	Maybe there's something wrong with my ears.
	It didn't sound like much of a song to me.
Nera
	Ⓠ My mighty hero! Ⓡ Le-gend-a-ry hero! Ⓠ
	Ⓠ You know no fear...that much is clear. Ⓡ
	Ⓠ My mighty hero...we hold you dear! Ⓡ Ⓡ
Nera
	Ha ha! Looks like I've gone and learnt the words without even trying!
%0%a001240
	Ⓠ My mighty hero! Ⓡ Le-gend-a-ry hero! Ⓠ
	Ⓠ Oust our foe... Um...
%0%a001240
	I can't remember the rest of the words.
%0%a001250
	%0%a001240's so lucky. I wish someone would write a song about me.
Sancho
	No. I esorry, friend, but I can no understand
	your tastes.
Bianca
	Oh! Did you not think that was any good, %a000090?
%0%a001240
	I think it's a good song. Didn't you like it, Dad?
	How funny!
Tuppence
	Maybe there's something wrong with my ears.
	It didn't sound like much of a song to me.
Nera
	Ⓠ My mighty hero! Ⓡ Le-gend-a-ry hero! Ⓠ
	Ⓠ Oust our foe...go on, have a go. Ⓡ
	Ⓠ My mighty hero...you'll steal the show! Ⓡ Ⓡ
Nera
	Ha ha! Looks like I've gone and learnt the words without even trying!
%0%a001240
	So he'd forgotten his hat the last time you saw
	him too? You'd think he'd know better after all
	these years!
Tuppence
	There are some scatterbrained folk about, aren't there? I'm not at all...um...scatterbrained, of course.
%0%a001250
	I've seen pictures of desert roses in books before. They're really pretty.
Bianca
	Hmm. I en't too sure about that.
Bianca
	Mum and Dad certainly didn't act like they had any Zenithian blood in 'em.
%0%a001240
	My Mum's really special! And I'm sure you probably are too, Dad.
Nera
	That means that one of my real parents must have had the blood of a Zenithian.
Nera
	Maybe that's why our family had the Zenithian Shield.
Tuppence
	So, if I marry that Zenithian woman in Gotha, maybe I'll become the father of the legendary hero!
Tuppence
	Hmph. No doubt my blood isn't good enough, though, even if it was mixed with some so worthy.
%0%a001240
	I feel like everyone's watching me. I don't know where to look!
Sancho
	Everyone een the castle, they look eso happy, no? You theenk ees because of %a001240?
%0%a001240
	I wonder what all this talk of the hero is about.
	How come everyone's been waiting for me?
%0%a001240
	Dad... Being the hero doesn't change anything,
	does it? I'm still your son, right?
%0%a001250
	It's a bit sad, really. I feel like there's a sort of distance between us and %a001240 now.
Tuppence
	Queen Cleohatra...
	What a beautiful name!
%0%a001250
	What do you suppose you have to do to
	become queen? Do you think you just have
	to study really hard?
%0%a001240
	The world is saved? Yes, well, I'll do my best. You're going to come with me and help out, right, Dad?
Bianca
	Yep. We'd better give it our all, eh, %a000090? It'll be nice to put smiles back on folks' faces.
Nera
	The world isn't saved automatically just because the hero exists. It's going to take a lot of effort.
Nera
	We'll have to do our very best to support %a001240 so that he can manage to fulfil his destiny.
Sancho
	Señor Pankraz...you, friend...and %a001240...
Sancho
	Sí. The fate, ees no gonna be like normal for %a001240. Your Uncle Sancho, he ees very worried, you know.
%0%a001240
	I'm not all that young! I get up in the night to go to
	the bathroom all by myself! And I always eat up all my dinner!
%0%a001250
	She's right. %0%a001240 is still pretty small.
	He's no taller than me, even.
Sancho
	Sí, thees ees right. %0%a001240, he ees the legendary hero, but he ees just a leettle boy.
Sancho
	You must protect heem well, friend.
%0%a001250
	Yeah, he even still wets the bed sometimes!
	...Er, but don't tell him I told you that.
Bianca
	So they've still bin snatchin' young kids durin' that time we was statues? Of all the evil things!
Nera
	Children are being kidnapped? That's just terrible! We must hurry up and put a stop to all this evil.
%0%a001250
	%0%a001240's handsome!? Hah! People often say I look sweet, but I've never heard anyone say he looks handsome before!
Sancho
	Sí. He ees handsome. And kind, and wise,
	and macho!
Sancho
	And %a001250, eshe ees the esame.
	Ees true, no, friend?
Tuppence
	I'm afraid it doesn't look like anyone here is going to have eyes for me now.
%0%a001250
	Girls like that are so silly. Why would she swoon over someone like %a001240?
%0%a001240
	She's got quite a voice on her! My ears are ringing from all that squealing she just did.
Bianca
	Ha ha ha! Looks like %a001240 has himself a few fans around here, eh?
Nera
	It feels rather odd seeing someone behave like that around my little boy.
Tuppence
	If only I could have that kind of effect on a girl!
	I wouldn't mind a bit of squealing in my direction
	for once.
%0%a001250
	Did you marry Mum because she's pretty, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Hmm. I thought so.
%0%a001250
	You chose her because of her personality?
	How romantic!
%0%a001250
	Huh! Why would %a001240 want to marry her? He'll always have me around, so he doesn't need anyone else.
Bianca
	The folk of Helmunaptra all seem so patriotic.
	I reckon they'd pull through anythin'.
Bianca
	And it's all because Queen Cleohatra has
	such a good way with 'em. There's a lesson
	to be learnt there.
%0%a001240
	That's like saying the people of Helmunaptra are less important than the helmet. That's weird!
%0%a001240
	I mean, I know the Zenithian Helm is precious and all that, but it doesn't mean as much to me as %a001250 and Sancho and everyone.
Sancho
	Friend! Ees dangerous!
	You no go eso close!
Bianca
	He's enthusiastic, I'll give him that. But fightin' against a mannequin en't goin' to be of any
	use to him in a real battle.
%0%a001250
	That poor doll! It's taking such a beating, even though it hasn't done a thing to deserve it.
%0%a001240
	Maybe I'd better start putting in some practice too. It's a big responsibility being the legendary hero.
Tuppence
	Her Majesty's assistants are certainly something special, aren't they, %a000090?
%0%a001240
	It's a bit embarrassing being called a hero all the time.
Tuppence
	Her Majesty's assistants are certainly something special, aren't they, %a000090?
%0%a001250
	People are expecting an awful lot of %a001240. I hope it won't be too much of a trial for him.
Sancho
	Ees eso hard work for thees one young boy to esave the whole world.
Tuppence
	She's another fine specimen, I must say.
Bianca
	It's reassurin' to know that she had that sort of premonition, eh?
Nera
	We can't let such a big responsibility fall to %a001240 alone. We'll all have to pull together as a family if the world's to be saved.
%0%a001240
	Written in the stars? She must have good eyesight!
%0%a001240
	Oh, I get it. She means it's a sort of destiny. Well, I'll do my best. You'll help out, right, Dad?
%0%a001250
	When Queen Cleohatra prayed for us just then,
	I got a really warm feeling inside.
Sancho
	Eef the world, ees no eso loco like thees, poor %a001240, he could leeve like the normal boy.
Tuppence
	What a travesty! Her Majesty seems to just look right through me.
Bianca
	That's odd. I suddenly feel a lot stronger since the Queen said that little prayer for us.
Nera
	It's such a terrible burden for %a001240.
	He's still so young.
Sancho
	Señor Pankraz, now he ees een the esky weeth the Goddess. They are looking down on you and praying for your esafety and happiness, friend.
Tuppence
	What a travesty! Her Majesty seems to just look right through me.
Bianca
	That's odd. I suddenly feel a lot stronger since the Queen said that little prayer for us.
Nera
	It's such a terrible burden for %a001240.
	He's still so young.
Bianca
	The smell of the grass and the water is so strong! This place is always really relaxin', eh?
%0%a001240
	It's just like a normal garden, apart from the fact that it's inside. It's so lovely and cool!
%0%a001250
	It's like a dream seeing so many lovely flowers inside a castle like this!
Nera
	What a yummy smell. It really is something special, finding a place like this in the middle of the desert.
Sancho
	You know, being een the desert, eet makes you eso happy there are the green plants and water een the world, eh?
Tuppence
	People say that you can tell a lot about someone from how their house looks. I don't think that's ever been more true than here.
%0%a001240
	Beetle's blood? I never knew that was precious.
%0%a001240
	I'd say this garden must be a million times more precious than that!
Sancho
	But eshe can no be eso beautiful like señora %a001230, eh, friend?
Sancho
	And I no believe any señora, eshe could ever be more beautiful than señora Mada.
Tuppence
	Ooh! Look at that bed over there. Perhaps it belongs to Queen Cleohatra...aaah.
Bianca
	It's pretty hard work keepin' plants goin' indoors like this, you know.
Bianca
	And yet they always seem to manage to have the place lookin' so nice.
Nera
	Oh no! We don't want to forget about our
	monsters! You'd better not look at the
	flowers too much, darling.
%0%a001240
	If it came to it, I'd still rather she spent her time making us some tasty dinner rather than looking after the plants!
Sancho
	Sí. Ees a very well-kept garden. The flowers, they are eso beautiful. I, I...
	No! I no gonna cry!
%0%a001250
	It's hard to imagine a time when the castle would've been surrounded by greenery instead of sand.
Sancho
	You theenk thees means that the places where ees green now, they can one day become like the desert?
Sancho
	For eso long, your father, he esearched for the
	legendary hero. And now we find out ees
	hees own grandson!
Sancho
	I am esure señor Pankraz, he ees very surprised, even though he ees up een heaven.
%0%a001240
	I've been feeling like something's calling out to
	me ever since we arrived here. Looks like it was
	the Zenithian Helm.
%0%a001250
	I'm not the legendary hero or anything, but you do still love me, right, Dad?
Tuppence
	Um... Are we going up or down?
Tuppence
	All these stairs have gone and got me quite confused!
Tuppence
	If I'd been born as your son...
	Does that mean I would've been...? Ha ha!
Debora
	Hmph. There's sand all over the place and all over me. I want a bath.
Debora
	We should go indoors as soon as we can. It's not good to be out in strong sunshine for too long.
Debora
	If I'm a descendant of the legendary hero, that means I must have some Zenithian blood in me.
Debora
	Perhaps that explains my other-worldly beauty.
Debora
	I've had just about enough of the heat here.
	It's high time we went somewhere cooler.
Debora
	%0%a000090, when this is all over, we'll make a garden in our castle to rival this one. Got it?
Debora
	Oh, it's going to be wonderful! We'll make the loveliest garden ever and then dedicate it to me!
Debora
	I'll be able to spend time there catching up on lost time with my people. Ah, I'm such an excellent queen!
Debora
	Never mind. Your opinion doesn't count for anything. If I've decided on a garden, I'm having a garden.
Debora
	What a lovely smell! I suppose it's all the more welcome because we've been traipsing about in
	a sandstorm. 
Debora
	Go and get %a001240, %a000090.
	Go on! Hurry!
Debora
	That helmet...
Debora
	It stands to reason that he's special ⓚⓛ he's my son ⓚⓛ but even I didn't expect him to be the legendary hero!
Debora
	The desert gets very cold at night. It'd be stupid of us if we ended up catching a chill, so we'd better hurry up and find a place to stay.
Debora
	Surely this can't be the little boy we met the last time we were here? So much time has passed!
Debora
	Stubborn old man! Poor Cleo sounds like she's had quite a time of it with him. I know the feeling.
Debora
	If it wasn't for the sandstorms and the sun being unbearably strong, this wouldn't be such a bad place to live.
Debora
	I didn't know you had an ear for music, %a000090. Marriage is full of surprises, isn't it?
Debora
	You didn't really like that song, did you?
	It was rubbish! And as for the lyrics...!
Debora
	If I'm a descendant of the legendary hero, that means I must have some Zenithian blood in me.
Debora
	Perhaps that explains my other-worldly beauty.
	I'm sure %a001250's going to be lovely too.
Debora
	I never imagined we'd turn out to be the heroes of a faerie tale.
Debora
	It's a bit of a chore, but I can't stand it when people do a half-baked job of things, so we'd better give it all we've got.
Debora
	How ironic that their kidnapping children because they were afraid they'd turn out to be the legendary hero actually led to the hero being born.
Debora
	I know I'll have to get used to my son being idolised, but it'd be nice if the girls could hold off on that awful screeching.
Debora
	Save the world, she says! As if it's as easy as clicking your fingers! Do these people have no idea what we're up against?
Debora
	It's okay, %a001240. %0%a000090, %a001250 and I will all be here to help you. That's what families are for.
Debora
	We're all going to help %a001240, %a000090.
	That goes without saying.
Debora
	%0%a000090, when this is all over, we'll make a garden in our castle to rival this one. Got it?

%0%a001250
	I don't understand. We both have the same parents, so why am I not some sort of legendary heroine?
	Oh! I wish I could save the world!
Debora
	You're a lot like your father, %a001250. I mean, you can empathise with monsters for one thing, right?
Debora
	So you're not the legendary hero. It doesn't matter. The powers you have are still remarkable, and they can help many people.
%0%a001250
	Thanks, Mum. I'll try my best. There are lots of people I want to help.
Debora
	%0%a000090, when this is all over, we'll make a garden in our castle to rival this one. Got it?
Debora
	Oh, it's going to be wonderful! We'll make the loveliest garden ever and then laze about in it all day long!

	Never mind. Your opinion doesn't count for anything. If I've decided on a garden, I'm having a garden.
