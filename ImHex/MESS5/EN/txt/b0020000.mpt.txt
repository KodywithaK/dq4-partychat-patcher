*: 
	Good day to you, Master. How jolly lovely to see you home!
*: 
	Mistress! Mistress! The master's home!
Mrs Porgie
	Welcome home, my dear.
	Look, little Georgie! Father's home!
Georgie
	Goo goo!
Mrs Porgie
	What is that statue you have there, my dear?
Mr Porgie
	It's quite impressive, don't you think?
Mr Porgie
	I thought it might be a nice good luck charm to put in the garden to commemorate little Georgie's birth.
Mrs Porgie
	All you ever think about is little Georgie!
	Where's my present, hm?
Mr Porgie
	Er, um... Oh dear! Ha ha ha!
	Something of an oversight there, I'm afraid.
*: 
	You must be exhausted, Master. Why don't you come inside and have a nice cup of tea?
*: 
	You too, Mistress.
Mrs Porgie
	Hurry, my dear! Come outside now!
Mr Porgie
	I say! Whatever is all the fuss about?
Mrs Porgie
	Look! Look at little Georgie!
Mr Porgie
	Well, I never! Little Georgie's started walking already. Well done, my boy!
Mr Porgie
	Come on, Georgie! Keep it up!
Mrs Porgie
	What a clever little boy he is!
Mr Porgie
	...............
Mrs Porgie
	What's wrong, darling? You've gone quiet all of
	a sudden.
Mr Porgie
	Oh, I'm only being silly really. It's just, one hears such terrifying rumours of late.
Mr Porgie
	I can only wish that little Georgie will be able to grow up in peace.
Mrs Porgie
	Don't worry, my dear.
Mrs Porgie
	We have that good luck statue you bought a year or so ago, after all. Nothing bad can happen to us.
Mr Porgie
	Ha ha! Of course. I'm sure you're right.
Mrs Porgie
	Do be careful, Georgie! If you frolic about too much, you're bound to fall and hurt yourself.
Georgie
	Whoopee! Woo-hoooo!
Mrs Porgie
	.........!
Mrs Porgie
	Georgie! C-Come to Mummy!
Georgie
	Hello! Who are you people?
Mrs Porgie
	Georgie!
*: 
	He he he! Is this the one?
*: 
	I dunno.
*: 
	Well, we can always use him as a slave if not!
	He he he!
*: 
	True. The small humans listen to orders much more than the fully grown ones do.
Mrs Porgie
	Please! No! Don't take my boy!
Mr Porgie
	I say! Whatever was all that hoo-ha about?
Mrs Porgie
	It's Georgie! Monsters have taken our little
	Georgie Porgie!
Mr Porgie
	Good heavens!
Mr Porgie
	It's hard to believe a month has passed by. I wonder where our little Georgie is now.
*: 
	Good day, Mr Porgie.
Mr Porgie
	Ah, Puddin. You're back.
Mr Porgie
	Any success at all? Any news of Georgie?
Puddin
	I'm afraid not, Mr Porgie. Not a thing.
Mr Porgie
	I see. Well, thank you for your efforts nonetheless.
Mr Porgie
	Pah! So much for you being a good luck charm, you worthless statue!
Mr Porgie
	Good luck indeed! Take that! And that!
Puddin
	Mr Porgie! Do try to calm down!
Mr Porgie
	Haah... Haah...
Puddin
	Dear me. Look at how you've worn yourself out!
Puddin
	Why don't you go inside and rest a little?
Mr Porgie
	Hmm. Very well.
~ %3And so the days and years passed.%4 ~
Mr Porgie

Mr Porgie

%0%a001250
	You're the one who gave me my name, aren't you?
%0%a001250
	Sancho's told us all about you.
%0%a001250
	And about Mum...
%0%a001240
	And about what a terrible state the world's in too.
%0%a001240
	Come on, Dad! Next we have to find Mum, and we're all going to look for her together!
%0%a001240
	Then we'll fight off all the baddies and save the world. Yay!
%0%a001240

*: 
	Good morning, Your Majesty!
	You slept like a log last night, didn't you?
*: 
	Your little ones and Mr Sancho don't know what to do with themselves, they're so happy.
*: 
	Oh, yes! Speaking of Mr Sancho, he asked me to give you this.
*: 
	It's a pendant made by a famous Gothan jeweller for the wedding of your father, King Pankraz, and your mother, Queen Mada.
*: 
	King Pankraz had meant to put a picture of her in the locket, you see.
*: 
	But she was taken before he could have an artist paint a picture of her.
*: 
	So it's remained empty all this time.
	Honestly, it's so sad, it's enough to turn the taps on!
*: 
	I think Mr Sancho's been terribly worried about whether he should give it to you or not.
*: 
	He said he thought it might make you leave to go off in search of her if he showed it to you.
*: 
	And the poor man doesn't want to put you in danger. I think he blames himself for what happened to your father.
*: 
	So you be careful, Your Majesty.
	Don't do anything rash.
*: 
	Anyway, pet, here's the locket.
~ %0%a000090 receives Madalena's locket. ~
~ %0%a000180 takes Madalena's locket. ~
*: 
	Go along, now. His Majesty, Prince Albert is waiting for you, you know.
*: 
	Both Prince %a001240 and Princess %a001250 have grown up to be such fine children.
*: 
	It's more than an old maid like me could ask for!
	They mean the world to me, you know.
%0%a001240
	Dad! You're going to look for Mum, right?
%0%a001240
	And you're going to beat up all the bad monsters that are trying to destroy the world on the way!
%0%a001240
	Take us with you, Dad!
	Please!
%0%a001250
	Sancho told me all about it.
%0%a001250
	When you were our age, you went travelling
	with Grandpa.
%0%a001250
	So you can't say you're not taking us with you now!
%0%a001250
	We'll be able to help you when you get in trouble.
%0%a001250
	See, I knew he wouldn't say no, %a001240.
	Come on!
%0%a001240
	Okay!
*: 
	Your Majesty, King %a000090!
	Gotha hasn't been the same without you.
	Everyone's been eagerly awaiting your return.
*: 
	Long live King %a000090!
	Peace and prosperity to Gotha!
~ What about Prince Albert and the others? ~
~ Better not keep them waiting. ~
*: 
	Ah, there you are, %a000090!
*: 
	I say! You don't mean to say you've forgotten who I am, do you? It's me, Bertie! Your old Uncle Albert!
Prince Albert
	Well, I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.
	You have spent the last eight years as a stone statue. A fossil before your time!
Prince Albert
	Well anyway, %a000090...
Prince Albert
	While we were looking for you, we stumbled across something rather incredible.
Prince Albert
	We found your mother's birthplace!
Prince Albert
	Pankraz wasn't very popular there, apparently, but that's all in the past now.
Prince Albert
	I should think the people there would be only too happy to help the son of one of their own.
Prince Albert
	Here, I'll show you where it is...
	Right there is where Queen Mada was born.
Prince Albert
	Be careful, won't you, %a000090?
	Don't land yourself in a fix.
*: 
	To be honest, Your Majesty, everyone would much rather you stayed here.
*: 
	But we've been waiting eight years already.
	A little longer won't hurt. That's what His Majesty, Prince Albert, says.
*: 
	But do be careful, Your Majesty!
Sancho
	Friend! Eh, I mean, King %a000090!
Sancho
	Prince Albert, he ordered the castle esoldiers to breeng for you the boat you used to esail.
Sancho
	And he ees asking the monster monitor, señor Monty, to come here to the castle. You find heem now een the pub.
Sancho
	And you find Patty, the party planner there too.
	Eshe geeves to you the esoldiers from the castle to join your party.
Sancho
	I hope you weell ask your Uncle Sancho to accompany you esometimes too, friend.
Sancho
	Sí, I am old these days, but the young ones, they no beat me! No, no, no, señor!
*: 
	I was ordered by your father, King Pankraz, to carry out research into a castle called Zenithia.
*: 
	So far, I've discovered this...
*: 
	Zenithia's supposed to be up in the sky, but it isn't any more. And the whereabouts of the Dragon God who used to live there are a mystery.
*: 
	Perhaps if the castle and its Dragon God were restored to their rightful places, the world would
	be restored to peace.
*: 
	It's just a theory of course, but you never know.
*: 
	Your Majesty! Prince Albert has informed us of the situation. Take care, sir!
*: 
	That strange, dark cloud is spreading even further over the sky.
*: 
	People say it's the coming of the Grandmaster of the Underworld... I, I don't know if there's any truth in it, but I know I don't like the sound of it.
*: 
	People are coming to Gotha in droves to celebrate %O0960%Xyour return, Your Majesty%Ythe return of King %a000090%Z.
*: 
	I hope the preparations for your trip go well.
*: 
	Urgh! My head's killing me.
	That was one glass too many last night.
*: 
	Now that the Chancellor's gone and you've become King of Gotha, His Majesty Prince Albert and his family occupy these chambers.
Gertrude
	Father's been so busy looking for %O0960%Xyou%YKing %a000090%Z, he hasn't had any time at all for me, or anything else for that matter.
Gertrude
	At least it meant he wasn't nagging at me all
	the time, though.
*: 
	Gotha's lost a lot of people since %O0960%Xyou went missing, Your Majesty%YKing %a000090 went missing%Z.
*: 
	My father's one of them. He left and never came back. He was a bit of a legend here in Gotha, you know. A famous craftsman.
*: 
	In all honesty, I'd like to go with %O0960%Xyou, Your Majesty%YKing %a000090%Z.
*: 
	But there are so few soldiers here at the castle now, we've got our work cut out just making sure the place is secure.
*: 
	Gotha's lost a lot of people since %O0960%Xyou went missing, Your Majesty%YKing %a000090 went missing%Z.
*: 
	My father's one of them. He left and never came back. He was a bit of a legend here in Gotha, you know. A famous craftsman.
*: 
	Actually, I hear %O0960%Xyou and your father%YKing %a000090 and the late King Pankraz%Z used to live in a place called Whealbrook.
*: 
	My father used to talk about Whealbrook. He said he wanted to visit the place because it was the home of a beautiful gemstone ore or something.
*: 
	What? You say you met a legendary jeweller who cut and polished a rough Whealbrook bluestone
	you had?
*: 
	Then...my father is alive?
*: 
	But there's no point deluding myself.
	I know he's not coming back.
	He's far too stubborn for that.
*: 
	Well two can play at that game! I'm going to stay right here and prove to the old man that I can be better than him!
*: 
	Well, well! That's King Pankraz's locket you've got there, isn't it? Made to celebrate his marriage to Queen Mada.
*: 
	They say it was his intention to commission an artist from Lofty Peak to paint a portrait of her to put inside.
*: 
	Perhaps you should carry out your father's wishes if you can, Your Majesty. I'm sure it would make him very happy.
*: 
	You are the son of King Pankraz.
	I am compelled to tell you.
*: 
	The blood of the legendary one lives on.
*: 
	Should the world be in need, so that blood shall rally forth! The legend shall rise again!
	Such is the word of my people.
*: 
	I'm sorry? You say %a001240 is able to equip himself with the Zenithian Sword? Benedicite!
*: 
	Queen Mada was a Loftinian.
	That means she came from Lofty Peak.
*: 
	I heard Loftinians have the power to slurppress the evil in monsters' hearts and make them goood.
*: 
	%O0960%XYou%YKing %a000090%Z can do that too, can't %O0960%Xyou, King %a000090%Yhe%Z?
*: 
	Welcome back to Gotha!
*: 
	Everyone's been longing for the great day of King %a000090's return!
*: 
	Woof! Woof, woof, woof!
*: 
	King %a000090! Back after eight long years!
*: 
	It's such good news, I couldⓚⓛ Hiccup!
*: 
	We've got our king back, now we just need our wonderful Queen %a001230.
*: 
	I can't quite remember what she looks like, but I was a big fan of hers.
*: 
	Hello. I'm Tuppence. It has been my dream to be a castle guard since I was a little boy, you know.
Tuppence
	Now it's my dream to accompany the King of Gotha on a mission somewhere! You know, to see a bit of swashbuckling action and all that!
Tuppence
	%O0960%XYou were magnificent in battle, Your Majesty!%YKing %a000090 was magnificent in battle!%Z
	It was an honour to see such a fine example of military expertise.

Tuppence
	Oh, yes! I wanted to show you this. I found it
	among my father's things. He was a castle
	guard too, you know.
Tuppence
	It's a chess set. Apparently all the soldiers in the castle were completely hooked on it once.
Tuppence
	A former chancellor introduced it, I think.
	The pieces were made by a castle craftsman.
	He was a bit of a legend, I hear.
Tuppence
	But according to my father's last will and testament, the game's infectious. It makes people bone idle.
	So I've been thinking...
Tuppence
	Perhaps you ought to take it so there's no danger of any slacking off again in the future.
	What do you say?
Tuppence
	Excellent! Then it's yours, Your Majesty.
	With my compliments.

	What an honour! It's just a tiny little place,

	Take care as you go.
*: 
	Oh, I see... Well, I shouldn't be surprised,
	I suppose. My little inn's not really monarch material.
*: 
	I used to say I hope the world's a more peaceful place by the time my little boy grows up.
*: 
	But do you know what my little angel said to me?

	our own peace, he said.

*: 
	It makes you breathe a huge sigh of relief finding this oasis in the middle of the desert, doesn't it?
*: 
	Right, so now the sighs are out of the way, let's get down to business!
*: 
	My sister's finally come back. It seems like she was away for an eternity.
*: 
	She said she heard someone talking about a desert rose in a spa town she visited and it made her feel homesick!
*: 
	Have we met somewhere before?
	I'm Cleo.
Cleo
	Youth is a fading memory for me now. I decided to return to the place I belong before it's time to mummify me.
Cleo
	Though life in the desert is hard, there is much beauty here.
Cleo
	For me, nothing is more evocative than dawn over the desert. It reminds me of my dancing days.
*: 
	People are saying the time is near when the legendary hero will return and come here to Helmunaptra.
*: 
	I'm a travelling minstrel, but I've decided to stay here for a while.
*: 
	It's always been my dream to meet the legendary hero and perform for him.
*: 
	Have you heard of these desert rose things?
*: 
	That's why I'm here. I came looking for one. The only trouble is, I forgot my hat, and it's far too hot during the day to go exploring without a hat.
*: 
	Aaah... Will I never ever learn?
*: 
	They're actually rocks that are shaped like
	roses, apparently.
*: 
	Most of the time they're buried under piles of sand, but there are sandstorms in this area every night that shift the sand about.
*: 
	If you spend the night at the inn and go out looking early in the morning, you're almost guaranteed to find one lying around.
*: 
	Far in the dim and distant past, a Zenithian woman descended from the heavens.
*: 
	Her child was to become a hero.
	The saviour of the world.
*: 
	That is but one of the many folk tales about the legendary hero.
*: 
	A thousand welcomes, %H0860%Xwanderer%Ywanderers%Z of the desert.
	This is the queendom of Helmunaptra.
*: 
	Cleohatra, Queen of the Desert, embraces all visitors of the desert.
*: 
	I'm researching the legendary hero.
*: 
	It is now clear to me that he did indeed come from Zenithian blood.
*: 
	But tracing his family line beyond the hero himself is extremely difficult.
*: 
	There's really no way to find out what happened to him now.
*: 
	Long ago, one of our ancestors accompanied the legendary hero on his quest.
*: 
	When together they restored peace to the world, he settled here, and Helmunaptra was born.
*: 
	Do you know what the ancient wisdom says?
	When a plague revisits the world, the legendary
	hero shall come once more.
*: 
	And Queen Cleohatra has spoken!
	The time is near!
*: 
	How can you become as beautiful as
	Queen Cleohatra?
*: 
	Welcome, %H0860%Xtraveller%Ytravellers%Z. This is the training room of
	our warriors.
*: 
	The day is near when the Great One comes for the legendary helm.
*: 
	We must keep it safe until the legendary
	hero returns.
*: 
	Kaaah! Stand back, or be hurt!
*: 
	Practising against a mannequin might just seem like sport, but the results are deadly! Hii-yaaah!
*: 
	You may find Queen Cleohatra below, in the Garden of Tranquility.
*: 
	The vast shadow foretold by Queen Cleohatra already starts to cover the world.
*: 
	But do not let despair cover your heart.
	She also foretells the coming of the legendary hero!
*: 
	Ha ha hah! Your heart leaps in surprise to see such a beautiful garden in the middle of the desert?
*: 
	Queen Cleohatra blesses us with this paradise, more precious than beetle's blood.
*: 
	Her astounding beauty, and her eyes that
	penetrate the mysteries of the future are her
	two greatest powers.
*: 
	The flowers of the Garden of Tranquility require constant tending.
*: 
	May their scent banish all thoughts of monsters from your mind!
*: 
	Travellers come here in search of desert roses.
*: 
	They are said to be found in places that once were blessed with water. In oases.
*: 
	Helmunaptra must once have been a rich and fertile land.
*: 
	Welcome to my queendom.

Queen Cleohatra
	Do you not have a son, %a000090?
Queen Cleohatra
	Yes. I was sure that you did.

	I sense a power in your son. A mighty power, stronger than the searing heat of the noon desert.

	Bring him to me. I must meet with him.
	And hurry.

*: 
	Welcome to Lofty Peak.
*: 
	This is the home of the forgotten ones.
	Those who the world no longer knows.
*: 
	Much time has passed since %H0860%Xa traveller%Ytravellers%Z last set foot in our village.
*: 
	Do you know about the flying carpet?
	I heard it's here around Lofty Peak somewhere.
*: 
	It'd make travelling a cinch, wouldn't it?
	I mean, you could just glide over plains and
	lakes and almost anything!
*: 
	Have you heard the legend of the
	mysterious tower?
*: 
	The tower that's said to reach all the way up to the heavens. He who climbs to its peak comes face to face with the God of Zenithia himself!
*: 
	Let me guide you, %H0860%Xtraveller%Ytravellers%Z.
*: 
	You have come here perhaps in the hope of discovering truth and reason.
*: 
	Then it is the four Elders of Lofty Peak you seek. They will enlighten you.
*: 
	Madalena belonged to us. She was a Loftinian.
	But the strong power of magic within her was a curse. It's because of this the monsters took her.
*: 
	Oh, Madalena! Where are you now?
*: 
	Above us is the council chamber of the Elders.
*: 
	We of Lofty Peak are the chosen ones.
	Chosen by the Goddess.
*: 
	It's said that once we possessed a great power.
	The power to transcend to and from the underworld, Nadiria.
*: 
	But the Elders are the only ones of us left with any vestige of that power now.
*: 
	There was one other among us, by the name of Madalena, in whom the power was still strong.
	But alas, she is long gone.
*: 
	Many, many moons it has been since we welcomed %H0860%Xa visitor%Yvisitors%Z in here.
*: 
	I was against it from the start. I didn't agree with one of our own being married to an outsider.
*: 
	How many moons ago must it be now, I wonder...
*: 
	There was another traveller who, like you, stumbled across our village. Lost, he was.
*: 
	He ended up falling in love with a young woman here, and the two of them left together.
*: 
	The young woman was called Madalena.
	And if my memory serves me correctly, the
	young man was called Pankraz.
*: 
	You mean our Madalena?
	You're a relative of hers?
*: 
	In that case, you should have the magic carpet and the key.
*: 
	Both are here in Lofty Peak.
	You must find them.
*: 
	And you must save Madalena.
	It is your destiny. We rely on you to fulfil it.
*: 
	Oh. My ears must be playing tricks on me.
*: 
	I once worked as a craftsman in Gotha, you know. My skills were well-known.
*: 
	But I left Gotha to follow King Pankraz.
	Alas, the hand of evil had already...
*: 
	No! I still cannot believe it!
	I refuse to believe King Pankraz is gone!
*: 
	I cannot depart from this hope that if I wait here long enough, he will come back with Queen Madalena by his side.
*: 
	I once worked as a craftsman in Gotha, you know. My skills were well-known.

	I cannot depart from this hope that if I wait here long enough, he will come back, together with Queen Madalena.
*: 
	Oh! Would that be a Whealbrook bluestone you have there?
*: 
	I see. Yes, King Pankraz stayed at Whealbrook for a period, did he not?
*: 
	Would you like me to cut that stone and polish it up for you?
*: 
	Well, I can hardly refuse a request from King Pankraz's own son now, can I?
*: 
	Leave it with me, and I shall transform it into something of true beauty.
*: 
	Yes, I will work on it tonight. Perhaps you could stay at the inn and come and find me tomorrow.
*: 
	No? Alright. Well, talking to you has been a great pleasure nevertheless.
*: 
	Zzz... Zzz...
*: 
	Hm!? Ah! It's been many moons now since I burnt the midnight oil working. My tiredness overcame me.
*: 
	I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. Here, this Whealbrook sapphire is for you.
*: 
	It would be unrivalled as an exhibit in the
	knick-knackatory, I have no doubt.
~ %0%a000120 receives a dazzling jewel! ~
~ %0%a000120 acquires a Whealbrook sapphire! ~
*: 
	King Pankraz was loved not only by his own men of Gotha, but by us craftsmen too.
*: 
	There was an artist among us ⓚⓛ now sadly deceased ⓚⓛ who pledged allegiance to King Pankraz and incurred the wrath of the Elders.
*: 
	Well met, %a000090, son of Madalena%H0860%X%Y, and your esteemed companions%Z!
*: 
	We have long known that you would come.
*: 
	Your father, Pankraz, displeased us by taking one of our own, Madalena, away from us.
*: 
	But you, %a000090, are their son, innocent of these crimes. We bear no grudge against you.
*: 
	It is time you learnt the truth now.
*: 
	According to the ancient scriptures, the Goddess divided the world into three realms.
*: 
	Zenithia, the realm of the holy ones, the earthly world occupied by the humans, and Nadiria, the underworld, where She sealed away demons.
*: 
	And She tasked some to be gatekeepers, to prevent free passage between these realms.
*: 
	We are those people.
	The people of Lofty Peak.
*: 
	The ancient power was strong in your mother. Madalena was very special.
*: 
	We believe the monsters took her in order to open the gates to the underworld, Nadiria.
*: 
	It is said that we of Lofty Peak were once bestowed with the power to open and close
	the gates between here and Nadiria.
*: 
	But over time, our people have lost this power.
*: 
	No longer can we open the gates even of
	the Estuary Sanctuary in the watery corridor
	north of here.
*: 
	I feel it.
*: 
	The gates open more with each passing year.
*: 
	If it continues so, even the colossal evil of the Grandmaster of the Underworld himself will manage to transcend into our world.
