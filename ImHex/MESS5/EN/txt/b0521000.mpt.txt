Bianca
	So we've gotta get over this mountain... Looks like it'll be hard work, but I'm sure we'll manage.
Nera
	I don't think I've ever seen such a tall mountain range. I hope we'll manage to cross it.
Bianca
	Do you think I'm jumpin' the gun a bit, sayin' Gotha must be your homeland?
Bianca
	Fair enough. I just have this feelin', though. I'm sure that's where you're from!
Bianca
	So you have the same feelin' too, then? I'm so sure Gotha must be where you were born!
Nera
	Do you think I'm being a bit presumptuous, assuming that Gotha must be your birthplace?
Nera
	Sorry. It's just that I have this feeling
	deep inside. I'm convinced that that's where you're from.
Nera
	Well, it's been a long time.
	Are you ready to go home?
Bianca
	This really is a tricky path. It's almost impossible to keep goin' in a straight line!
Nera
	I feel like I've been all lop-sided for most
	of this journey! It certainly is hard work climbing mountains.
Bianca
	Haah... Haah...
	I'm fine, really. Dun't worry about me.
Nera
	I-I'm fine, honestly. I can keep up with you.
	You don't need to be concerned.
Nera
	I can't believe Papa sent a messenger all the way out here!
Nera
	What a wonderful thing to send to us.
	How generous of Papa!
Bianca
	This place is givin' me the willies. How d'you suppose that skeleton ended up over there?
Nera
	There's a horrible cold feeling to this place.
	I'm probably just imagining things, but it feels sort of sinister.
Bianca
	I dun't much like the sound of that old woman's laugh. She sounds like a witch or somethin'.
Nera
	I probably shouldn't really say so, but I'm not all that taken with the old woman. She makes me feel a bit uneasy.
Bianca
	She wasn't a bad old stick, after all. I feel bad for doubtin' her now.
Nera
	I feel so guilty for doubting such a kind old lady. It looks like I still have a lot to learn when it comes to judging others.
Bianca
	That strange laugh is enough to give anyone
	a fright!
Nera
	Waaah! I'm frightened! That old woman's laugh really is scary!
Bianca
	First a mountain path and then a cave.
	Up and down, up and down. I'm startin'
	to feel like a yo-yo!
Nera
	I'm not very good with heights, so I feel a bit less anxious now we're here inside this cave.
Bianca
	It must be because we're high up. I seem to be gettin' tired more quickly than normal.
Bianca
	I can see light. That means the exit can't be
	far away.
Nera
	........................
Nera
	I-I'm fine, really. I'm just finding it a bit of a struggle to keep up with you sometimes because you're so fast.
Nera
	I'm probably stronger than when we first set out on our travels together, don't you think?
Nera
	That's a relief. I wouldn't want you to feel
	like you have to leave me behind because I can't keep up.
Nera
	Oh dear. I'm sorry. I'll try harder from now on, I promise. I'll make you proud.
Bianca
	I'm glad I've got you and all your funny friends to travel with, %a000090. Life's never lonely for me.
Nera
	I don't think I would've set off on my travels alone. You've opened up a whole world of possibilities to me.
Debora
	I'm so tired. I've just about had enough.
	You'll have to do all the work now, %a000090.
Debora
	You probably think I'm getting ahead of myself, just assuming that Gotha's your hometown, right?
Debora
	And yet you'd still have me climbing mountains to get there! I wouldn't stand for that! No, Gotha has to be your hometown. I'm sure of it.
Debora
	Good. You know better than to say something like that to me.
Debora
	Ouch, ouch, ouch! What are you looking at?
	I haven't got a blister, if that's what you're thinking.
Debora
	Haah... Haah...
	How are you managing this so easily?
	You could at least offer to carry me!
Debora
	You could learn a lot from a warrior like him.
	Make yourself a better servant still.
Debora
	I'll take that. You don't mind, do you?
	It's a gift from Papa, after all.
Debora
	There's nothing for us in this nasty place.
	Hurry up and get moving!
Debora
	We didn't come all this way to talk to that old woman. Hurry up and get back outside. That's an order!
Debora
	I've had enough, I really have.
	We're leaving. Now.
Debora
	I couldn't laugh in such a creepy way if I tried.
Debora
	So now we have to traipse through a cave?
	I'm starting to think I should've worn some more sensible clothes.
Debora
	The problem is that sensible clothes never seem to be very pretty.
Debora
	I'm getting a bit tired. Given that you're my personal slave, I really think you should give me a piggyback.
Debora
	I wonder if we're near the exit. I wouldn't mind having a rest before long.
Debora
	Travelling alone could probably be quite good fun, but it's so much easier with a servant around to do all the hard work.
