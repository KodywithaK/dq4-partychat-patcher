	I'm a collector of mini medals, which are said to be scattered all over the world.
King Dominicus
	Splendid! I see you have some mini medals with you. Let me be examining them, %H0860%Xmy friend%Ymy friends%Z.
King Dominicus
	By Jimini! I see you've brought yet more mini medals! Sorry to be a moaning minnie, but I'm afraid even I need to draw the line somewhere.
King Dominicus
	You're currently carrying %a000570 mini medal%H0570%X%Ys%Z. Would you like to exchange any of your medals for prizes, %a000120?
King Dominicus
	What may I administer to you?
King Dominicus
	Hmm... I'm afraid you'll need to maximise your efforts and collect more mini medals before I can part with something of such eminence.
King Dominicus
	You'd like %a020100?
	Very well, my little minikin.
King Dominicus
	And to whom should I administer %M0100%Xthem%Yit%Z?
King Dominicus
	It seems that %a000180's hands are full enough as it is! Perhaps you should rearrange your items and minify the space they take up.
King Dominicus
	Or perhaps not... I don't mean to meddle, but all of %a000180's items seem to be rather too prominent. 
King Dominicus
	Maybe someone else could carry %a020100 instead?
King Dominicus
	Marvellous! That's that wasted space beautifully minimised!
King Dominicus
	%0%a000180 can't seem to equip %a020100. Shall I proceed regardless?
King Dominicus
	Shall I equip %M0100%Xthem%Yit%Z for you right away?
King Dominicus
	Splendid! I assume that means you must be rather taken with %M0100%Xthem%Yit%Z.
~ %0%a000180 equips %a020100! ~
King Dominicus
	Your reward is administered!
King Dominicus
	Is there anything else you'd like?
King Dominicus
	Very well. Do let's mingle again sometime!
King Dominicus
	My joy at seeing new mini medals never diminishes! Bring them to me, and your rewards will not be miniscule!
