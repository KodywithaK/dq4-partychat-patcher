Bianca
	I know there's an important reason behind your journey and all that, %a000090.
Bianca
	But it is quite nice travellin' around different towns together. It feels like bein' on honeymoon!
Nera
	I feel like I've been given a whole new lease of life now that I'm with you, %a000090.
Nera
	I hope we'll have lots and lots of
	adventures together!
Bianca
	This place really has the feel of a port town, eh?
Nera
	Smell that sea air! You can definitely tell it's a port town.
Bianca
	Any idea what that bloke was on about?
	It all went right over my head!
Nera
	Did you understand what that man was talking about? I'm afraid I had no idea!
Bianca
	There do seem to be a lot of special souvenirs in a lot of the places we visit. Maybe it'd be fun to try collectin' them.
Nera
	It would be nice to buy the occasional souvenir, but I suppose we can't afford to add to our luggage too much.
Nera
	Oh, you don't mind? I suppose you are very strong. Well, if you don't mind carrying them...
Bianca
	Mt Azimuth is the highest mountain in the world. People certainly do some crazy things, eh?
Nera
	It's incredible to think that people are capable of such feats. I just hope they manage to avoid being attacked by monsters there.
Bianca
	That poor old man. I hope that dun't mean he's all on his own now.
Nera
	People say there's nothing worse for a parent than outliving a child.
Nera
	It's hard to find the right words to console
	that poor old man.
Bianca
	The cheek of it! It dun't matter that we dun't have money, anyhow. We got love and that's what counts! Wish I'd said that to him...
Nera
	He he. No one's ever said anything like that to me before!
Nera
	I feel as if I've started a new life since I married you, %a000090.
Bianca
	When I look at the monsters you've managed to befriend, %a000090, I find it hard to believe that all of them can be bad.
Nera
	I suppose even gods and goddesses need a break from time to time. We just have to hope the break doesn't last forever, that's all.
Bianca
	It looks like they get their fair share of church donations here, eh?
Nera
	I wouldn't be surprised if lots of people don't even realise there's a bank here.
Bianca
	I wonder what he means. We should go and see what we can find!
Nera
	How strange that that sailor knows there's something there and yet doesn't go and get it himself. I wonder what it is.
Bianca
	I know him! He used to study under the man who made us some medicine for my father back when I was little!
Nera
	To think that man once dreamt of being a pharmacist and yet he's ended up a sailor!
	You never can tell where life will take you.
Nera
	Isn't Whealbrook the village you come from?
Nera
	I would've liked to have visited it all those years ago.
Bianca
	It's a bit damp down here, en't it? Maybe the monsters prefer it that way.
Nera
	The monsters here are very well-looked-after. They certainly seem happy and healthy enough.
Bianca
	There's all sorts of treasure around the world, but I'm your prized one, right, %a000090?
Bianca
	Ha ha ha! Thanks!
Bianca
	Hey! I was about to say you were mine!
Nera
	It's really sweet how children have such big dreams like that.
Bianca
	The desert sounds pretty excitin'. Can we go and have a look, %a000090?
Nera
	I don't tend to be very good in the heat I'm afraid, but if you want to visit that desert, then of course I'm happy to go with you.
Bianca
	A shrine to the legendary hero? Maybe that
	means there are ancestors of his there.
	You can only hope!
Nera
	If there's a shrine there to the legendary hero, then maybe some of his belongings will still be there too.
Bianca
	He didn't really sound like he was takin' you seriously, eh?
Nera
	Maybe there's a lot of talk here about the legendary hero. That man behind the bar didn't seem overly interested.
Bianca
	Looks like we're not the only ones tryin' to track down the legendary hero.
Nera
	It would be a difficult journey for a scholarly type who's not used to fighting. That poor wife of his can't be enjoying it much either.
Bianca
	The Grandmaster of the Underworld, eh? I wonder if he really exists. I hope not!
Nera
	When you look at how wild things are out in the countryside nowadays, it's not hard to believe that this Grandmaster might be at work.
Bianca
	Dad and I stayed at this inn on our way to Stockenbarrel all those years ago.
Bianca
	I remember him moanin' and sayin' he couldn't relax properly in a place like this!
Bianca
	So the show's only on of a night? I don't remember it bein' that way when I was here before.
Nera
	Those dancing girls are wearing rather skimpy outfits! I hardly know where to look!
Bianca
	Since when have you bin so good with
	the ladies, eh?
Bianca
	Huh! Oh well. I suppose I have to put up with things like that now I'm married.
Nera
	How could you!? (sob) I'll go crying back to Papa if you say things like that!
Nera
	...He he he! Only joking!
	You should see the look on your face!
Nera
	I'm so pleased that you answered her like that.
	It really makes me feel like you only have eyes for me!
Bianca
	It looks like a tough old job bein' a dancin' girl. I'd hate to have to wear make-up like that.
Nera
	Make-up? Well, I must admit, I, er, do use the tiniest amount every now and then.
Bianca
	Haah, haah...
	Spiral staircases are pretty hard work, eh?
Nera
	This staircase is rather frightening.
	You won't let me fall, will you?
Bianca
	Fancy bein' here on your own for forty years tendin' to a flame! What a job!
Nera
	He certainly seems dependable. People setting out to sea shouldn't have anything to worry about with him in charge.
Bianca
	The chosen ones can climb up there easy as pie? What d'you suppose he meant by that?
Nera
	I wonder what you have to do to be chosen. Maybe you just have to be pure and good. Or maybe it's not that simple.
Bianca
	Wow! The view from here's blimmin' incredible!
Nera
	Don't walk too close to the edge, will you?
	I know the view's nice, but it's a bit too
	scary for me.
Bianca
	Dark already, eh?
	Shall we stay the night here?
Nera
	I can't believe it's night already! Time flies so quickly when I'm with you. Shall we stay here at the inn until morning?
Bianca
	Pretty impressive. He's still keepin' up the chatter even though he's sloshed.
Nera
	Oh dear! Do you think that man's alright?
	He seems to have drunk rather a bit too much.
Bianca
	So it's not just on land. The monsters in the sea are gettin' more vicious too. Things are goin' from bad to worse.
Nera
	I'd better try to make myself a bit stronger so that I don't end up being a hindrance to you.
Bianca
	That poor old man. I feel really sorry for him.
Nera
	I know the poor man must be feeling terribly desperate, but he really shouldn't be sleeping in a place like this. He'll catch his death of cold.
Bianca
	A casino? I'm always worried I'd get hooked if I went somewhere like that, and I'd end up losin' all my money!
Nera
	Papa took me to visit the Ventuno more times than I can remember.
Nera
	It's his favourite casino of all, you see.
	That's why he had us get married there.
Bianca
	Maybe the reason she doesn't complain is because she's lost interest. Oh dear...
Nera
	I'm going to make sure I keep you happy so that you feel glad you chose me, just like he's glad he chose his wife.
Bianca
	What!? What do you expect me to say to that!?
Nera
	Goodness! She certainly seems to be having quite a dream!
Bianca
	It must be difficult being a mother. Non-stop worry, by the sounds of it!
Nera
	I can really sympathise with how that lady feels.
Nera
	I hope the world's more peaceful by the time we have children of our own.
Bianca
	Looks like someone fancies a treasure hunt! I was always dreamin' of adventures and treasure when I was his age.
Bianca
	It looks like that soldier's travellin' around with his son. It reminds me of you and Pankraz, %a000090.
Nera
	I suppose it's to be expected that people will assume we're on our honeymoon.
Bianca
	Someone's havin' sweet dreams! It's amazin'
	he can get to sleep at all with so much goin'
	on around him.
Nera
	The face of a sleeping child is like the face of an angel. Oh! I want a baby!
Bianca
	That bloke's really creepy. I dun't much like seein' men act like that.
Nera
	I could never dance or dress like that.
	I'd be too embarrassed!
Bianca
	Do you reckon the girl in the middle's pretty too, %a000090?
Bianca
	Hmph!
Bianca
	Good!
Nera
	The girl in the middle certainly is the most striking. I can see why she's so popular.
Bianca
	The desert sounds pretty excitin'. Can we go and have a look, %a000090?
Nera
	I don't tend to be very good in the heat I'm afraid, but if you want to visit that desert, then of course I'm happy to go with you.
Bianca
	I didn't expect to hear talk of Pankraz in a place like this.
Nera
	Your father sounds like he was a great man.
	I wish I could have met him.
Bianca
	Looks like that fella behind the bar's bin
	tryin' to help us out by bringin' a bit of
	info our way, eh?
Nera
	Pubs seem to attract customers from all walks of life. I suppose it's logical then that it's a good place to get new information.
Bianca
	Searching for a knight in shinin' armour sounds like fun! If I hadn't married you, I'd probably have a bash at that myself!
Nera
	You're my knight in shining armour, %a000090!
Bianca
	So that fella makes ships in bottles? He dun't seem the type somehow.
Nera
	He wouldn't be able to sell so many of them
	if they weren't of a decent quality. He must
	be very skilled.
Bianca
	Let's go over there. We don't want to hang around here too long otherwise people'll start to think we're with him.
Bianca
	The Grandmaster of the Underworld, eh? I wonder if he really exists. I hope not!
Nera
	When you look at how wild things are out in the countryside nowadays, it's not hard to believe that this Grandmaster might be at work.
Nera
	How bizarre! Men can be ever so funny sometimes.
Bianca
	Urgh. That man looks like a really dirty piece
	of work.
Nera
	I don't think I've ever seen anyone with quite that expression on their face before.
Bianca
	She's makin' a go of things for herself,
	though, eh? Even though she is far from home. Good for her!
Nera
	It sounds like there might be a bit more to
	the story of what brought her here than meets the eye.
Bianca
	She en't wrong! That's a lot of sweat!
	Looks like it's hard work bein' a dancin' girl.
Nera
	It's probably quite good for you to sweat like that. People say it gets rid of all the impurities.
Bianca
	Hey! What d'you think you're doin'? You think it's alright to go bargin' in on people like that, do you?
Bianca
	Pah! Pankraz must be cryin' tears of disappointment if he's lookin' down on you
	now from heaven!
Bianca
	Right answer.
	So let's go.
Nera
	You wouldn't like it if someone burst in on you like that, would you?
Nera
	Well, maybe you should think how others feel sometimes.
Bianca
	It's pretty here at night with the moonlight shinin' in.
Nera
	What a lovely light the moon gives off in here.
Bianca
	En't this bloke supposed to be the one takin'
	care of the lighthouse? I wonder if the flame's still goin'.
Nera
	Surely night-time is when the lighthouse flame is most needed. Maybe we should wake him up.
Bianca
	Hey! Maybe it's the cat who's keepin' watch over the lighthouse! Ha ha ha!
Nera
	Perhaps it's the cat's turn to tend to the flame at night. Cats can be quite clever, you know.
Bianca
	This is amazin'! I feel like I could reach out and touch the stars!
Nera
	Don't walk too close to the edge, will you?
	I know the view's lovely at night, but it's
	a bit too scary for me.
Bianca
	That bloke must really be a big fan of telescopes to be sleepin' here!
Nera
	He he he! He looks just like a little boy!
Bianca
	Blimey! This place is bigger than it looks!
Nera
	I've been here lots of times before with Papa.
Bianca
	This ship in a bottle is really well-made.
Nera
	The ship inside this bottle looks just like
	Papa's ship.
Bianca
	Oh! What a shame we can't afford it!
Nera
	We can't afford it? Oh well. We are only
	just married, after all. Most people aren't
	that well-off at the beginning.
Bianca
	Uh-oh! Looks like that's on its way out to sea!
Nera
	I do feel sorry for the man, but he probably should've been a bit more careful with it if it means that much to him.
Bianca
	Maybe we should go and pay a visit to Briscoletti.
Bianca
	He did put on a great weddin' for us, after all.
Bianca
	What a huge ship! This is so excitin'!
	Let's hurry up and get on board, %a000090!
Nera
	This was Papa's boat originally, but now it's your boat too. Why don't we go aboard?
Bianca
	I en't scared of nothin' as long as I'm with you, %a000090.
Nera
	The sea monsters are scarier than ever lately. We should be careful.
Bianca
	Have you bin on this boat before, %a000090? Oh, right. You were on it once with your dad, eh?
Nera
	I remember being on this ship a long time ago. I'd only just been taken in by the Briscolettis and I was so nervous.
Nera
	We met a father and son who were travelling together. The boy was so young. It sort of gave me courage seeing him.
Nera
	He had an expression in his eyes that I somehow haven't been able to clear from my mind even after all these years.
Nera
	I don't suppose...
	Were you that little boy, %a000090?
Nera
	I knew it! That means the man who helped me aboard must've been your father...my father-in-law!
Nera
	Oh dear! I hope you're not jealous now, then!
Nera
	This boat's been in use for as long as I can remember. Papa certainly takes good care of his possessions.
Debora
	I do enjoy being able to travel like this. Not to mention having three square meals a day and my own personal slave into the bargain.
Debora
	Marriage isn't at all bad.
Debora
	I don't mind port towns per se, but I hate the damage the sea air does to my poor hair. So you'd better find us an inn for the night pronto.
Debora
	You've obviously met him before then, have you?
Debora
	You must've done, because you cut him off before he explained himself, so you've clearly heard it all before.
Debora
	A souvenir... I suppose we could start picking up the odd souvenir here and there. You'll obviously be the one who has to carry them, though.
Debora
	How do they expect anyone to be able to visit if they're building it in such an awkward place?
Debora
	Honestly! I don't know what goes on in people's heads sometimes.
Debora
	I wonder how he'd react if we told him we held our wedding there. That'd wipe the smirk off his face!
Debora
	I can't say I blame the Dragon God for wanting to take a break. It happens to the best of us.
Debora
	I've no interest in saving money.
	If I ever need any, I just ask Papa.
Debora
	How annoying! Couldn't he just go and get it for us rather than sending us off on a wild goose chase?
Debora
	So he planned to be a pharmacist and now he's a sailor... Life certainly takes some unexpected turns.
Debora
	I never imagined I'd be standing here with you now for one thing.
Debora
	Can you get a move on and wrap things up here? Places like this make me feel claustrophobic.
Debora
	You're not interested in hunting for treasure any more, are you, %a000090? After all, you've found the greatest treasure there is...me!
Debora
	If we're going to the desert, we'll need water.
	And suntan lotion and parasols and...
Debora
	You'll have to get it all ready, okay? Not me.
	Just to be totally clear.
Debora
	If there's a shrine to the legendary hero, I suppose there could still be some descendants of his around. Makes sense.
Debora
	He didn't seem that interested in talk of the legendary hero.
Debora
	Mind you, I doubt I would've taken much notice if I wasn't married to you.
Debora
	I thought the legendary hero was just that: a thing of legend. But it seems that you're not the only one looking for him and believing he's real.
Debora
	The Grandmaster... If he really exists, then there's probably a legendary hero out there somewhere too.
Nera
	I stayed here with Papa and Debora when I was little.
Nera
	I think we came here by boat that time too.
Debora
	Nera and I stayed here with Papa when we were kids.
Debora
	I tried to sneak out at night, but Papa was right outside the door. I'll say this for him: he's always been pretty on the ball in that respect.
Debora
	Looks like they put on a show in the evenings.
	If you want to see it, I'll come with you.
Debora
	You must be either brave or stupid, saying that when I'm right by your side.
Debora
	I won't let you forget this in a hurry.
Debora
	As if you'd dare say otherwise when you have me to answer to! It's good to see you know your place, %a000090.
Debora
	I never have problems with my make-up.
Debora
	By the way, I've decided to have an early night tonight. All these new experiences have worn me out.
Debora
	How much longer do these stairs go on?
	My feet are killing me!
Debora
	Working here wouldn't be too bad. Not with three meals a day, a siesta, plenty of breaks and my own servant to take over every once in a while.
Debora
	I don't need to worry about whether I'm a chosen one or not. It stands to reason that I would be.
Debora
	I still don't feel inclined to climb all the way up to the top of that mountain, though.
Debora
	The view's not bad. It would be a lot better if we hadn't had to climb all those stairs to get to it.
Debora
	It's getting late so you'd better hurry up and find us somewhere to stay. Nothing irritates me more than a man who's slow off the mark.
Debora
	Ugh! He reeks of drink! You won't know what's hit you if you ever come home to me in that state, %a000090.
Debora
	You'd better toughen up a bit then, %a000090.
	I wouldn't want you dragging me down.
Debora
	Can't he do his crying in private? Besides anything else, he's old and he could catch his death out here.
Debora
	I went to casinos with Papa more times than I can remember, but he hardly ever let me play on anything.
Debora
	I'll make up for that the next time I go, though.
	You'll have to stump up all the money for the tokens, %a000090.
Debora
	You picked a ⓗgood'unⓘ too, %a000090.
	So you'd better make sure you keep working hard to deserve me.
Debora
	Sounds like quite a dream she's having there!
	I wonder if she often has awful dreams.
Debora
	Mama's just like that, always worrying far too much about her babies.
Debora
	But maybe I'll end up just the same when I'm a mother. Do you think I will, %a000090?
Debora
	Hm. So that's how you see me, is it?
Debora
	You're right. Any child of mine will be special like me, so I won't have anything to worry about.
Debora
	That reminds me of how Nera used to bury her things and draw treasure maps when she was little.
Debora
	Did I do the same? No, but I had a whale of a time digging up her stash! Ha!
Debora
	Oh yes. I suppose we're proper newlyweds.
	I'd completely forgotten already.
Debora
	He's doing well to stay asleep in a busy spot like this. That's a skill that'll stand him in good stead in the future.
Debora
	Stupid buffoon! He was so fixated on that dancing girl that he didn't notice he had a real beauty standing right next to him.
Debora
	I suppose the one in the middle is the prettiest.
	She's still not a patch on me, though.
Debora
	If we're going to the desert, we'll need water.
	And suntan lotion and parasols and...
Debora
	You'll have to get it all ready, okay? Not me.
	Just to be totally clear.
Debora
	The old man was talking about your father, wasn't he? It's a shame I never got to meet him.
Debora
	He doesn't look like he's paying much attention to what people say, but he obviously takes it all in.
	He could be a useful person to know.
Debora
	A knight in shining armour? I'd rather have a personal slave who's at my constant beck and call.
Debora
	Don't let that go to your head, though.
	It wasn't intended as a compliment.
Debora
	If he can make ships in bottles, he's obviously a lot cleverer than he looks.
Debora
	The Grandmaster... If he really exists, then there's probably a legendary hero out there somewhere too.
Debora
	Let's be on our way, %a000090.
	We don't want to be associated with the likes of him.
Debora
	Men like him really are a waste of space.
Debora
	Sounds like there was a reason she couldn't stay at home. It's a long way for a young girl to come travelling on her own.
Debora
	I never do yucky things like sweating.
	I leave all that to you, %a000090.
Debora
	You're an oaf, %a000090. If you ever come barging in on me like that, you'll be sorry!
Debora
	It's lovely in the moonlight. And it means people can enjoy my good looks at night as well as during the day.
Debora
	Er, he's not much of a lighthouse keeper if he sleeps at night. This is when the flame needs to be alight!
Debora
	Surely he's not left it up to the cat to look after the flame. No cat's that clever!
Debora
	The stars are lovely, aren't they? I'm very drawn to pretty things. I suppose like attracts like.
Debora
	He can't part with his beloved telescope even when he's asleep. You men never grow up, do you?
Debora
	Papa brought me here lots of times.
Debora
	Do you know how they make ships in bottles, %a000090?
Debora
	You're surprisingly good when it comes to trivia.
	Not that I'd accept anything less from my personal servant, of course.
Debora
	They feed each piece in one by one and assemble them inside the bottle. You're lucky I'm so knowledgeable.
Debora
	I've never been so poor that I couldn't afford one measly souvenir. You'd better not make me feel this wretched ever again, %a000090.
Debora
	What a klutz! I find people like that so irritating.
Nera
	Oh dear. We should probably have asked for Papa's permission before trying to take the boat.
Debora
	What an oaf! Fancy not recognising me!
Debora
	Looks like we'll have to go home and ask for Papa's permission to use the boat. What a pain!
Debora
	This is Papa's boat, which means it's also mine.
	You can use it if you want.
Debora
	This is Papa's boat, which means it's also mine.
	You can use it if you want.
Debora
	This boat's certainly starting to show its age.
	I suppose it's had a lot of use over the years.
Debora
	You don't need to worry, though. Papa always takes good care of things, so I'm sure it's seaworthy. Probably.
Nera
	I used to draw treasure maps when I was his age. I'd even go so far as to bury the treasure myself. He he!
Nera
	But it was really very strange. I'd always end up finding the treasure mysteriously back inside my cupboard.
Nera
	I was completely baffled by it. Debora said it was probably some faeries up to their tricks.
Debora
	When I was little, I once sailed on this boat from Littlehaven with Papa and Nera.
Debora
	It was my first time on a boat, so I was desperate to get on. I was running and I bumped into a tough-looking warrior.
Debora
	It was his fault, though. He was standing stock-still, dazzled by my beauty. No matter that I was less than half his age!
Debora
	I was reminded of that the first time we ever met.
	I just had a feeling of déjà vu.
Debora
	We should leave him to his thoughts.
	That's about all we can do for him.
Debora
	What's wrong?
	Why are you looking so troubled?
