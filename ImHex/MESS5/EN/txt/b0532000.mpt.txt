	Is this a mountain? Or is it a village?
	Whatever it is, it's pretty amazing!
%0%a001250
	This place feels all familiar for some reason.
	I like it here.
Sancho
	Thees place ees the birthplace of señora Mada. Ees esometheeng like magic een the air, no?
Tuppence
	It's easy to get lost in a place like this if you
	don't pay attention. Now, let's see. Which way
	did we come from?
%0%a001250
	The forgotten ones? It'd be horrible to be forgotten. You won't forget me, will you, Dad?
Sancho
	Qué? The forgotten ones?
	What has happened to señora Mada?
%0%a001240
	I never forget places I've been, even if I've only been once. I wonder who the people here have
	been forgotten by.
Sancho
	Your Uncle Sancho ees no eso young, you know? But estill, een all of my life, I never esee a village een a place like thees unteel now.
%0%a001240
	Sounds like we're the first visitors they've had here in a while.
%0%a001240
	Um, I didn't get a birthday present or anything from you in all those years, right?
%0%a001240
	So I was thinking... It'd be great if you could get me that flying carpet!
%0%a001250
	I thought flying carpets only existed in folk tales
	and books!
Sancho
	Eef we had the flying carpet when I am
	travelling weeth señor Pankraz, everytheeng would be eso much easier.
Tuppence
	It seems the flying carpet is quite a precious item.
	I wonder how much one could sell something like
	that for.
%0%a001240
	I love being in high places. If we find that tower, I'm going to climb right to the top and look down over the whole world!
%0%a001250
	Do you think that tower was built so people could get up to Zenithia? How strange!
Sancho
	No... I no remember esuch a tower from the time when I travel the world weeth señor Pankraz.
%0%a001240
	We're not bothered about truth and reason, right? We just want to find out more about Grandma.
Sancho
	You know, ees very high up here.
	Thees village, ees een a scary place, sí?
%0%a001250
	It's not fair! There are loads of monsters about who aren't evil. They can't help it if some of them get ordered to do bad things.
Sancho
	Sí. Ees true. After thees, señor Pankraz, he decided to leave on the quest to find her.
Sancho
	The quest from which he never
	would return...
Sancho
	Hahh...hahh... Hahh...hahh...
	I never esee the place weeth eso many ups and eso few downs!
%0%a001240
	Wow! Look! Just look at how far you can see from up here!
%0%a001250
	I'm too scared to look down!
Tuppence
	I wonder if anyone's plummeted to their death from up here.
%0%a001250
	Was Grandma really so powerful? It must've been pretty awful when she decided to leave here, then.
%0%a001240
	All this talk about the Goddess and the underworld is a bit complicated, isn't it?
Sancho
	You see how great a man señor Pankraz was? He fell een love weeth thees señorita, but eshe ees no ordinary señorita. No, no, no.
Tuppence
	Do you think it's true that they were chosen by the Goddess? Maybe they just assume that because they have these special powers.
%0%a001240
	Wow! What an amazing key!
	It's glowing a really strange colour.
%0%a001250
	That's the magic key that opens all sorts of doors, right? Hmm, now where was it you can use it again?
%0%a001240
	Is this the flying carpet? Do you think it's the real thing? Is it, Dad? Is it real? Can we have a ride on it? I'm so excited!
%0%a001250
	It looks just like a normal bit of carpet to me.
	Do you think it can really fly?
Tuppence
	It looks like rather an ancient piece of carpet. Do you think it'll stand up to us all trying to ride on it?
Sancho
	Ees okay eef you want to keep eet esafely away een your bag, but you must take eet out esometimes for the airing.
Sancho
	Eh! You no worry about eet, friend! Your Uncle Sancho, he can do these chores for you.
%0%a001250
	If we stay here, maybe we'll dream about Grandma. That'd be nice. I'd really like to see her.
%0%a001240
	I wonder if Grandma ever stayed here.
%0%a001240
	Oh, I suppose not. If she lived in the village, then she wouldn't need a room at the inn. Silly me!
Sancho
	Even here, there are weapon and armour eshops.
	But they no eseem to go well here, you no theenk?
%0%a001240
	There's a proper shopkeeper and everything, but I wonder if there are ever any customers.
%0%a001240
	It sounds like the people here don't often visit the outside world. That must be a bit lonely.
Sancho
	Eh! Who ees thees brazen buckaroo!?
	Señora Mada, eshe was eso happy
	married to señor Pankraz.
%0%a001240
	That's Grandpa Pankraz!
	Good for him!
Tuppence
	Hopefully it won't be too long for me now...
	Er, nothing. Never mind.
%0%a001240
	No way! There's a flying carpet here somewhere? Wow! We'd better find it, Dad!
%0%a001240
	Ha! We've already got it.
	We've already got the flying carpet!
%0%a001250
	We can't prove that we're related to Grandma, though. Do you think it matters?
%0%a001250
	Sancho said we should always beware of people who try to give us things for free. Does that mean we shouldn't trust that man?
Tuppence
	If only I were a relative of hers, then the flying carpet would be mine. Hmph!
%0%a001240
	Dad! You mustn't tell fibs, you know.
	You should tell him the truth.
Sancho
	You are no just a relative of señora Mada, friend.
	You, you are her eson!
Sancho
	The people here, they are good to you because you are her child.
Sancho
	Ees a miracle! We have found the missing craftsman of Gotha! I never expected to find heem here!
%0%a001240
	It's nice to meet people who like Grandpa Pankraz and Grandma Mada so much.
%0%a001250
	But Grandpa Pankraz is definitely dead, right? Killed right before your very eyes... Oh! (sob)
Tuppence
	Aah! So that's the famous craftsman from Gotha!
	Well, well, well!
Sancho
	Ees a miracle! We have found the missing craftsman of Gotha! I never expected to find heem here!
%0%a001240
	Yay! I can't wait until tomorrow!
%0%a001250
	Do you think he can really turn a plain old stone into something beautiful? Really!?
Tuppence
	So we'll soon see the work of a famous
	craftsman. I don't know that I'll be able to
	get a wink of sleep tonight.
Sancho
	Ees a miracle! We have found the missing craftsman of Gotha! I never expected to find heem here!
Tuppence
	Goodness! That's incredible! Who'd have thought that an old bit of rock like that could be transformed into something so exquisite?
Sancho
	Sí, sí! Thees ees a true craftsman.
	When you esee the fine work like thees, you no feel like the artisans, they are dying, eh?
%0%a001250
	It's so pretty! Do you think this was hidden inside the stone all along? Wow!
%0%a001240
	That was worth doing, wasn't it, Dad? It's
	very pretty. You should probably use it to
	decorate something.
Sancho
	Sí, sí... Señor Pankraz, he was loved by everyone.
	He was, was... (sob)
Sancho
	The artist from Lofty Peak...?
	Eef he was taken by the Goddess...
Sancho
	Thees means ees no possible to complete the locket of señora Mada.
%0%a001240
	So someone here pledged allegiance to Grandpa?
	I would've liked to have met him.
%0%a001240
	The world's divided into three realms?
	Did you know that, Dad? I always thought
	there was only one world!
%0%a001250
	If only there was a world where humans and monsters could play together nicely.
Sancho
	Sí, I believe these elders, they would feel eso
	angry to lose señora Mada because eshe had
	esuch estrong powers.
Sancho
	But ees no the fault of you, friend. Or your
	father, señor Pankraz. You no can tell love to go away when he comes.
Tuppence
	I'm prepared to travel to the ends of all three worlds with you, Your Majesty!
%0%a001250
	So if we go to the world of the monsters, does that mean we'll find Grandma?
Sancho
	Sí. Señor Pankraz, he knew esometheeng about thees. But he no want for me to be eenvolved.
Sancho
	You know, he never tell me anytheeng about thees. I, I... (sob)
Tuppence
	They may call themselves ⓗEldersⓘ, but they're actually quite young and splendid-looking.
	How odd!
%0%a001240
	So they're losing their powers? And it's just Grandma who still has them?
%0%a001250
	Does that mean Grandma's being forced by the bad people to open the gates? Poor Grandma!
Tuppence
	I see. Guarding those gates must be quite
	a responsibility. Rather different from your
	run-of-the-mill soldiering.
Tuppence
	Er...um...dearie me! What a complicated situation we seem to have found ourselves in.
%0%a001240
	If the Grandmaster of the Underworld comes here, he'll start destroying the place. We have to go and stop him before he gets here!
Sancho
	Ees no esounding good, eh? Maybe een the end, ees thees Grandmaster of the Underworld we must fight, sí?
%0%a001250
	So this was Grandma's room. It's nice and big, but it's got a bit of a lonely feel to it.
Sancho
	Ees a book of psalms? A book your madre, señora Mada, eshe used to read, sí? You must
	keep thees memento esafe, friend.
%0%a001240
	Did you notice that this room's the highest room in
	the village?
%0%a001240
	It's a bit like in faerie stories where they have the princess locked up in the highest room of a tower!
Tuppence
	A book of psalms? I'm sure it will be of use to us in times of need. If only those up on high would be there for us...
%0%a001250
	So this was Grandma's room. It's nice and big, but it's got a bit of a lonely feel to it.
Sancho
	Sí. Señora Mada, eshe has the beeg heart.
	Beeg, estrong and beautiful.
%0%a001240
	What does she mean by light in your heart?
	Is that the same as just being light-hearted?
%0%a001240
	It's a bit scary in the dark when it's all quiet. Can we please go and stay at the inn now, Dad?
%0%a001240
	It's always so quiet here in Grandma's village.
	It makes me feel a bit sleepy.
%0%a001250
	I'm so sleeeepy...
Sancho
	Ees late, sí? We no go for the siesta yet?
	Early to bed, early to rise. Thees ees the best way, you know.
Tuppence
	Aah, I'm rather tired today.
	Er, no, no! I'm fine! Fit as a fiddle!
%0%a001240
	I wonder what the food's like here.
	I'm absolutely starving!
%0%a001250
	The forgotten ones? It'd be horrible to be forgotten. You won't forget me, will you, Dad?
Sancho
	Sí, sí. The elder peoples, they are always going to bed early. We come back een the morning, okay?
%0%a001250
	Sancho said it's rude to visit people too late in
	the evening.
%0%a001240
	I'm not scared of night-time! I don't wet the bed any more, so what's there to be afraid of?
	...I don't wet it, honest!
%0%a001250
	I know how he feels. Scary creatures come out at night. You can hear their footsteps...
