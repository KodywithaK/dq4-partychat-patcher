Harry
	Buck up, Kendrick! Greet %a000090 properly and don't be so rude!
Kendrick
	Ouch!
	Um... Pleased to meet you.
Harry
	Sorry about him. He's a bit of a cheeky one at times.
Harry
	You've got children now too, haven't you?
Harry
	I'd love to meet them sometime. You must bring them with you and introduce them one day.
Harry
	Hello, %a000090.
	Good to see you again.

Harry
	Hello, %a000090.
	Good to see you again.
Harry
	You've got children now too, haven't you?
Harry
	I do beg your pardon. I'm afraid my son's manners are a bit lacⓚⓛ Oh!
Harry
	Good heavens! It's you, %a000090!
	I've been hoping you'd pay a visit.
Harry
	I can't tell you how thrilled we were to hear you'd turned up in Gotha in one piece.
Harry
	You did have a rotten bit of luck there, eh?
Harry
	In fact, you've always seemed to be a bit jinxed, come to think of it.
Harry
	Still, it's great to see you here again safe and well.
Harry
	Oh yes! I'm a father now, by the way.
Harry
	This is my son, Kendrick.

	Ouch!
	Um... Pleased to meet you.
Harry
	Sorry about him. He's a bit of a cheeky one at times.
Harry
	You've got children now too, haven't you?
Harry
	Ah! I see you are travelling as a family. Hello there. Yes, I can see the resemblance to how you looked at that age.
Harry
	I know! Why don't you children play together for a while? Kendrick can show you around.
Harry
	Kendrick! Why don't you be a good host and give your best guided tour of the castle?
Kendrick
	I suppose I could.
Harry
	That's good. Now we'll have a bit of peace and quiet for a while.
Maria
	Listen to you! You know you adore that boy, really.
Harry
	Ha ha ha! You've got me there, Maria!
Harry
	I don't know who Kendrick takes after sometimes, though.
Harry
	I'm sure I wasn't such a troublemaker when I was his age.
Maria
	It sounds like your travels are just as trying as ever, %a000090.
Maria
	I'm sure you'll be able to guide the world in the right direction towards peace, though.

%0%a001240
	He told us to go and get some kind of lackey's badge, and then he disappeared while we were looking in the treasure chest.
%0%a001240
	Can you come and help us find him?
~ %0%a000090 moves the chair aside and searches underneath it. ~

%0%a001240
	Hey! What a weird place for a flight of stairs!
%0%a001240
	You're amazing, Dad!
	Fancy knowing they were there!
Kendrick
	Huh! You found the stairs already. That was no fun.
Kendrick
	I'll bet you didn't find the lackey's badge, though. That means you can't be my lackey!
Kendrick
	Hm?
*: 
	Prince Kendrick! I do hope you're not causing trouble down here again!
Kendrick
	What's your problem? I'm not doing anything wrong!
*: 
	Your father will be most displeased when he hears about this. Now, come along!
*: 
	Hello there, King %a000090. Your children are still within the castle walls.
*: 
	Please go ahead and collect them before continuing your journey.
%0%a001240
	Let's look for Kendrick, Dad.
*: 
	Ah, good day to you, King %a000090!
*: 
	We here in Coburg have been hearing
	all about you.
Maria
	It sounds like your travels are just as trying as ever, %a000090.
Maria
	I'm sure you'll be able to guide the world in the right direction towards peace, though.
Harry
	Sorry Kendrick caused you a bit of bother there, %a000090.
Harry
	You can find me here all the time, by the way, so do drop in whenever you're passing.
Harry
	And do try not to go missing again, eh?
Kendrick
	Sorry about before. Dad said I had to apologise,
	so I decided to give you this.

Kendrick
	What do you want?
	Can't you see I'm busy?
Harry
	Sorry Kendrick caused you a bit of bother there, %a000090.
Harry
	I don't know who he takes after sometimes, though.
Harry
	I'm sure I wasn't such a troublemaker when I was his age.
Harry
	Oh yes! There's something I've been meaning to give you for ages now.
Harry
	Remember how we didn't manage to have you along to our wedding?
Harry
	Well, we'd very much like you to have a special souvenir from the day to make up for it.
Harry
	You remember where my old room is, right?
	Kendrick sleeps there now.
Harry
	The souvenir is inside the treasure chest in that room, so just go along and help yourself.
Maria
	Coburg's finest music-box maker crafted us some commemorative souvenirs for our wedding.
Maria
	I don't know why Harry's gone and hidden one inside the chest in his old room, though.
	How curious!
~ %0%a000120 examines the treasure chest. ~

~ ⓗI was too embarrassed to say this to your ~

~ ⓗThere's not a day goes by even now when I don't spare a moment to remember your father. ~
~ ⓗDuring our time as slaves, I always had an urge to make it up to you, the fact that I'd lived when he died. ~
~ ⓗIt was that urge that took me through each day and helped me survive that awful time. ~
~ ⓗI don't imagine there's anything in my power I can do to assist you in your quest for the legendary hero. ~
~ ⓗBut it's my sincere hope that ruling this kingdom wisely and protecting my people will be of some help to you in some way or other. ~
~ ⓗYou'll always be my lackey, %a000090... Ha ha ha! No, you'll always be my dear friend.ⓘ ~
Harry
	Hm? You couldn't find the wedding souvenir in the treasure chest?
Harry
	Ha ha ha! You're just as easy to trick as you
	ever were!
Harry
	Very well. I'll give it to you properly this time.

	The stars are so pretty. Aaah!
*: 
	It doesn't make any sense.
	I can't fathom what I've done with it.

	I bought some armour from a peddler the
	other day, you see, but I can't find it for the
	life of me now.

	I made sure not to put it in amongst my things for sale, and I was trying to keep it safe. Hmph!

Frank O'Phobe
	Oh! If I remember rightly, you're that friend of Prince Harry's, aren't you?
Frank O'Phobe
	Well, well, well! It's been many a year since
	I've seen you.
Frank O'Phobe
	...And yet, even after all this time, you look just the same as you did back then. Funny that.
Frank O'Phobe
	The kingdom of Coburg is just on from here.
*: 
	My little brother was over in Whealbrook hunting for those famous Whealbrook bluestones some years back.
*: 
	Seems the way to find them is to dig them out from the inside of large rocks.
*: 
	My elder sister runs a tombola place over in Lodestar Harbour.
*: 
	I may be wrong, but I seem to think the special prize is some kind of loyalty card or other.
*: 
	Hey! H-Haven't we met somewhere before?
*: 
	M-My poor h-husband was g-gobbled up by a m-monster, you know.
*: 
	What a t-terrible state the world's in now.
*: 
	You look nice and strong. Maybe you c-could round up all the n-nasty monsters and k-kill them all!
*: 
	I'm b-begging you! (sob)
*: 
	Zzzz... (sob)
*: 
	Hello there. Do I know you?
*: 
	Welcome to Whealbrook. The Goddess always watches over he who travels Her land.
*: 
	Don't be mean to me! I've boing living in Whealbrook a long time. I used to live in the cave.
*: 
	People say there's a T 'n' T place somewhere where you can get your hands on a goolorious
	T 'n' T free pass. (slurp)
*: 
	We had a terrible time of it all those years back when our shop was set on fire.
*: 
	But seein' my daughter growin' up healthy and happy has done a lot to restore my optimism again.
*: 
	Life's not all bad after all, eh?
*: 
	There's nothin' of any value here any more, but we used to have people comin' in search of the famous Whealbrook bluestones.
*: 
	Maybe they're still here somewhere, hidden in big rocks in the cave or somethin'.
*: 
	Anythin's possible. There are rocks in there big enough to trap people underneath them, y'know.
	㈡
	*: Somethin' that big could easily be hidin' a gem.
*: 
	Yay! A customer! A customer!
*: 
	Hello there. Do I know you?
*: 
	That old man there took me in when I lost both my parents and had no one.
*: 
	It's thanks to him I was able to start up my shop too. I started off with the weapons he collected in Whealbrook Adit in his younger years.
*: 
	I'm just makin' the beds at the moment.
	You have a good rest, won't you?
*: 
	Zzzz...

*: 
	Welcome to Roundbeck!
*: 
	A traveller, are you? I used to do a bit of travellin' myself in the past, goin' over Coburg way an' sellin' weapons.
*: 
	You can do a pretty good business in weapons here nowadays, mind. Just goes to show the sorry state the world's in, eh?
*: 
	People are sayin' that some almighty ⓗmaster of the underworldⓘ is tryin' to destroy us.
*: 
	But that the Order of Zugzwang will come to the rescue of anyone who chooses to follow them.
*: 
	I dunno, though. I think I'd rather look after myself and not go relyin' on others like that.
*: 
	This one here may be full of it now, but he was a right coward once upon a time.
*: 
	He ran away from Coburg when things got a bit hairy, you know!
*: 
	The fella in the pub said somethin' about how there's a grandchild of the legendary hero out there somewhere.
*: 
	If that's really true, it'd be great to meet them.
*: 
	Did you know that the Order of Zugzwang are based at Mt Azimuth? They have a big temple there.
*: 
	What I don't get is how normal folk like us
	are supposed to climb up a huge mountain
	like that, though!
*: 
	I've heard talk that somewhere in our world is a clan of people who guard the seal to the underworld.
*: 
	People say that those folk have some special power to communicate with the monsters.
*: 
	There are lots of scary rumours flyin' about at the moment about how the world's in peril.
*: 
	But there's not a fat lot I can do about it. So I just keep my head down, cook nice meals for
	my son, and hope for the best.
*: 
	My old man and I bought this place years ago off a man called Whitaker, and we started runnin' our own inn.
*: 
	Why dun't you stay the night? We've got a special offer on at the moment where you get a souvenir if you stay two nights or more!
*: 
	Make sure you come and see me after two nights stayin' here, won't you?
*: 
	Hm? You've stayed two nights already?
	What a good customer you are!
*: 
	Then I must give you one of our famous grape-scented Roundbeck Zizzwizz Pillows!
~ %0%a000120 receives a Zizzwizz Pillow! ~

*: 
	Oh dear. With business this bad, I dun't know how we're goin' to afford to pay our remittances to the Order of Zugzwang.
*: 
	Ooh! Hello there, young man!
	Would you like a drink?
*: 
	Here you are. Enjoy!
*: 
	Then what can I do for you?
	The legendary hero, eh? Just a sec!
*: 
	It's my dad who knows all about that.
	Why don't you go on in and pick his brains?
*: 
	My dad knows a thing or two about the legendary hero. Ask him as much as you like.
*: 
	You want to know about the legendary hero, do you? Then you've come to the right place!
*: 
	Long, long ago, the Lord of the Underworld, Es...something or other, was resurrected, and set about destroying the world.
*: 
	But then the legendary hero, with the Zenithian Equipment on his side, defeated him and saved us all.
*: 
	He had four items altogether: the Zenithian Sword, the Zenithian Armour, the Zenithian Shield and the Zenithian Helm.
*: 
	Hm? What happened to him after that?
*: 
	Some say he returned to Zenithia up in the sky, but I don't know if that's what really happened or not.
*: 
	It was all a long time ago, anyway, so I very much doubt he'd still be alive now.
*: 
	I s'pose you might be able to find one of his descendants somewhere if you were lucky.
*: 
	A traveller, are you? I used to do a bit of travellin' myself in the past, over to Coburg
	sellin' weapons.
*: 
	You can do a pretty good business in weapons here nowadays, mind. Just goes to show the sorry state the world's in, eh?
*: 
	I was still thinkin' of him as my little boy, but he's suddenly got so big!
*: 
	Still, he'll always be my baby!
*: 
	Goo! Goo!
*: 
	Ah-phew, ah-phew...
*: 
	Ah-phew...
*: 
	Did you know that the Order of Zugzwang are based at Mt Azimuth? They have a big temple there.
*: 
	What I don't get is how normal folk like us
	are supposed to climb up a huge mountain
	like that, though!
Bianca
	Oh! Sorry, %a000090. Did I wake you?
Bianca
	It's just, I've bin thinkin' a lot
	about things in the past.
Bianca
	It's not that I'm feelin' sad or nothin'. That's all done and dusted now, I know that.
Bianca
	Um, can I come over to you, %a000090?
Bianca
	I want you to know...
	I love you.
Bianca
	Don't be mean! I'm comin' anyway.
*: 
	Ooh! Hello there, young man!
	Would you like a drink?
*: 
	Here you are. Enjoy!
*: 
	Then what can I do for you?
	The legendary hero, eh? Just a sec!

	That's amazing! If I was you, I'd put it on display in a museum or something. I mean, it's like, ultra-rare!
*: 
	I've heard people talk of this amazing weapon called the dragon staff. Do you know anything
	about it?
*: 
	It actually turns you into a gigantic
	dragon, apparently!
*: 
	I wish I could find it. So far all I've learnt is that it's in some tower where the soul of a dragon rests, whatever that's supposed to mean.
*: 
	Gosh, darn it, I'd give my right arm to be in that casino right now.
*: 
	Oh, what the heck! I'm sick o' this store. I'm goin'!
*: 
	Oh, why did I marry such a loser? He keeps leavin' the store open and makin' a beeline for the casino.
*: 
	I don't know! Men!
*: 
	Guess I shouldn't be sayin' all this to %H0860%Xyou%Yyou guys%Z.
	It's not your problem, huh?
*: 
	That poet guy's in here everyday boozin' and drinkin'. Ya think he's okay?
*: 
	Too much drinkin's supposed to make your throat hoarse, or so I heard.
*: 
	Sorry, %H0860%X%A0110%Xyoung man%Z%B0110%Xlittle lady%Z%Ykids%Z. Adults only in here.
*: 
	Darn it, an' I thought I'd gone an' met my dream lady there for a while.
*: 
	Ain't you got enough women up there
	already, Goddess?
*: 
	I gotta get dinner on the table before my old man and son get home.
*: 
	You look like %H0860%Xa traveller%Ytravellers%Z to me.
	Don't you miss having a home to
	go back to in the evening?
*: 
	No, I guess you're too young to feel
	like that yet, huh?
*: 
	Yee-ha... Yee-phew... Yee-ha...
	Store's only open after dark, pardner.
*: 
	Huh? Is there anythin' tougher than the
	Zenithian Equipment?
*: 
	There surely is, my friend.
*: 
	The dragon staff, the shimmerin' shield, the Pallium Regale and that there sun crown.
*: 
	Them four are the toughest pieces of equipment y'ever doggone seen!
*: 
	I was a traveller myself, you know, back in the day.
*: 
	Ah, they were fine times. Fine times!

Mystic Mridula
	Kah ha ha hah!
	Let me tell you what am I seeing...
	Three rings will be guiding you.
Mystic Mridula
	The first is the Circle of Fire. The second is the Circle of Water. And the third is that toe-tapping number, the Cir-cle of Li-i-ife! Ⓠ Ⓡ
Mystic Mridula
	Bringing all of these three circle rings together
	will open up the way for you. A brand-spanking
	new way.
Mystic Mridula
	And I am seeing one more thing...
	This the Circle of Life, it is in a very high up place.
	High, I tell you! High! Kah ha ha hah!

Mystic Mridula
	Many moons ago, I am hearing of these people who are guarding the gate to another world.
	Your answers are lying there.
*: 
	Hi! I'm, like, Monty's assistant, Carla.
Carla
	There are these, like, totally weird monsters and they're, like, near the Neverglade and in the Realm
	of the Faeries and stuff.
*: 
	Hi! I'm, like, Monty's assistant, Carla.
Carla
	There are, like, some special monsters that you can, like, only make friends with at T 'n' T boards and other, like, really special places.
Carla
	But you've gotta be, like, totally awesome before you can make friends with them.
Carla
	You're already, like, this totally awesome
	monster handler.
Carla
	I'm, like, sooo not worthy of teaching you
	anything now.
*: 
	This is the town prison. If you wanna talk to the inmates, better do it through the bars.
*: 
	How could you let a criminal like that go?
*: 
	But I guess, if the world's about to be swallowed up in some cloud of evil darkness, he should get the chance to go where he wants to.
*: 
	How long are they gonna keep me locked up in
	here, huh?
*: 
	What? You're lettin' me out?
*: 
	Gee, thanks, pal!
*: 
	Oh, yeah. Check out that stool over there.
	Think of it as a mini reward for helpin' me out.
*: 
	I've been locked up in 'ere fer ten years now.
*: 
	Yer the first %A0110%Xbloke%Z%B0110%Xperson%Z who's bothered to say anyfin' to me in all that time.
*: 
	I ain't got nuffin' to give ya, but I can tell ya somefin' that'll keep ya out o' trouble.
*: 
	The slot machine that's second from the left in
	the back row o' the casino's the one wot pays out
	the most.
*: 
	Welcome to the Fortuna casino!
	I've gotta tell ya before ya start, we
	only accept tokens in here.
*: 
	You can buy tokens from the cashier over there.
*: 
	Hey! Sorry, but kids can't play in here unless they're accompanied by an adult.
*: 
	Those are the rules. Can't ya get someone to
	bring you?
*: 
	They never give you gold back, no matter how many tokens you win.
*: 
	The best way to enjoy the fun's to buy tokens with any leftover gold you have, but not to break the bank.
*: 
	Listen to this!
*: 
	See that monster? It's such a long shot, they're offering odds of forty to one! Can you believe it!?
*: 
	Go on! That's the way!
*: 
	I just don't ever seem to get a win.
	Do you think someone's inside there,
	fixing the results?
*: 
	Wahoo! Another win for Lucky Larry!
	I'm on such a roll today!
*: 
	These performers aren't bad.
*: 
	Still nothing. Maybe it's bust or something...
*: 
	How's it goin', pal?
	Are ya winnin'?
*: 
	Yeah? Go for it, then! You gotta go for it when you're on a winnin' streak!
*: 
	No? Don't worry, it'll come. Your luck's gotta change sometime, right?
*: 
	Folks are all talkin' about this darkness that's gonna destroy the world.
*: 
	But we've all gotta die sometime, right?
	Gotta enjoy life while you can, I say.
	Let the good times roll!
*: 
	There's people from all walks o' life in this here town. The good, the bad and the ugly.
*: 
	And it looks like you've had your fair share of suffering to me.
*: 
	Have ya heard about the legendary hero?
	Everyone's speculatin' about whether he's
	gonna show or not.
*: 
	I've got a thousand G down that says he does!
Heidious
	Hello everyone! I'm Heidious! I'm so beautiful, everyone turns to look at me.
Heidious
	Just look at my stunning dress.
	It fits me so well, it hurts!
Heidious
	Poor Cindy. Is she beautiful? Oh, no she isn't!
	Is her dress stunning? Say it together with me
	now everyone... Oh, no it's not!
Wicked stepmother
	Have you seen my two daughters?
	They couldn't be more different.
	One is Heidious... (Why are you laughing?)
Wicked stepmother
	The other is Cindy, that shabby little witch my husband brought into the family.
Wicked stepmother
	But tonight is the night of the ball!
	My Heidious will woo the handsome
	young prince!
Cindy
	Hi, friends! I'm Cindy! I'm just a plain little girl. My stepmother's so kind, she lets me stay in the house. She's wicked.
Cindy
	I feel so nervous. My heart is pounding in my chest.
Cindy
	Tonight is the night of the ball!
	And I'm actually going!
Cindy
	Please, faerie godmother!
	Please don't spoil my dream!
*: 
	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!
	Tonight is the palace ball!
*: 
	Where's the stunning young beauty come to
	steal a prince's heart? What? She's behind me?
	Oh, no she isn't!
*: 
	This is our changing room.
	Don't go peekin' in the closets, okay?
*: 
	The boss said he's gonna let that travellin' theatre group take the stage durin' the day.
*: 
	Hey! You ain't allowed in here when we're changin'! Even if you are a casino customer.
*: 
	What? These are the results?
	Unbelievable!
*: 
	You just can't get a handle on these slimes,
	no matter how much you study their form.
	They're slippery ones, that's for sure.
*: 
	Boing, boing! (slurp)
*: 
	I'm a hopping slurpsation when I goo for it.
*: 
	You want me to tell you something good?
	Err... I know! The weather gloopcast!
	Today might be %a001220...
*: 
	Hmm... Yes, I better go this way around.
	No, perhaps that way around would be better
	after all...
*: 
	Hah hah hah! Fell off too, did ya?
	So, you're a ⓗfell-aⓘ then, are ya?
	Hah hah hah!
*: 
	I've been playin' this T 'n' T board for thirty years now, and I've never got to the end.
*: 
	I enjoy seeing other people fall off, though.
	I've got a great joke about it!
*: 
	You're in Fortuna now! Everyone's welcome, and everyone can enjoy the fun!
*: 
	Unbelievable!
	I lost again!
*: 
	If I hadn't bet on that one back there, I'd have been alright.
*: 
	Purrr...purrr...purrr...
*: 
	Ya like takin' a stroll around town at night?
*: 
	It's swell, ain't it? My wife and I used to
	enjoy it too.
*: 
	No? Me neither. It just makes me think of my wife.
Mystic Mridula
	Kah ha ha ha hah!
	I am mystic-mystic Mystic Mridula. And I don't like this person who is leading your party.
Mystic Mridula
	If you are giving to me a man of my liking, I will gladly look into a crystal ball, poke my finger in dirty tea leaves, whatever you are wanting...
Mystic Mridula
	Kah ha ha hah! Welcome to Mystic Mridula's super-duper fortune-telling mumbo-jumbo bonanza!
	You wanna give it a go, no?
Mystic Mridula
	Okey-dokey! You're such a handsome cookie,
	I'll do it for free!

*: 
	My husband's in the bathroom. You'll have to wait if you want to go in there.
*: 
	Hey, get out! Can't a man get a moment's peace around here?
*: 
	My kids have started playin' outside of town just recently. It's kind of a worry.
*: 
	I wish the world was a more peaceful place,
	and we didn't have to think about monsters the
	whole time.
*: 
	Ah-phew...
*: 
	Folks are complainin' a lot these days.
	It ain't good for business.
*: 
	Hey, handsome! Sit down and enjoy a drink, huh?
*: 
	Hmm... The drinks in this bar are getting worse if you ask me.
*: 
	Oh, yeah!
	The casino is my friend!
*: 
	I'm gonna celebrate tonight!
*: 
	Uuurgh, my 'ead! Hic!
*: 
	There's nothing like having your family
	around you!
*: 
	Tag'zzz boring now...
	Zzz... Zzz...
*: 
	Is Grandpa at the bar again?
	Oh boy, he's gonna be in trouble!
*: 
	You want to talk to Grandma?
*: 
	She'll be around town somewhere telling
	people's fortunes.
Carla
	Zzz... Zzz...
	Like, zzz...
*: 
	Ah-phew, ah-phew.
*: 
	How long are they gonna keep me locked up in
	here, huh?
*: 
	What? You're lettin' me out?
*: 
	Gee, thanks, pal!
*: 
	Oh, yeah. Check out that stool over there.
	Think of it as a mini reward for helpin' me out.
*: 
	I've been locked up in 'ere fer ten years now.
*: 
	Yer the first %A0110%Xbloke%Z%B0110%Xperson%Z who's bothered to say anyfin' to me in all that time.
*: 
	I ain't got nuffin' to give ya, but I can tell ya somefin' that'll keep ya out o' trouble.
*: 
	The slot machine that's second from the left in
	the back row o' the casino's the one wot pays out
	the most.
*: 
	Now you look like a seasoned old trav'ller to me, pardner. In that case, you won't wanna be without this here Big Book of Beasts!
*: 
	I wanna say three thousand gold coins for it, but I just can't resist givin' you a discount, pardner! So how about we settle on a thousand?
*: 
	Yee-ha! You got yourself a deal!
	I'll just go on and put it in your bag for you.
	Ride 'em, %A0110%Xcowboy%Z%B0110%Xcowgirl%Z!
*: 
	Okay, pardner. You're the boss!
*: 
	Sorry, pardner, but you look to be a little
	short of cash.
*: 
	Don't be a stranger now, pardner. If I git ahold of any more unusual items, I'll be puttin' them up for sale. So come on by again, y'hear?
*: 
	Howdy, pardner! Now didn't I just sell you one o' my fine monster menageries?
*: 
	I ain't got no other fancy goods to be sellin' you right now.
*: 
	But I can't let my best customer leave empty-handed now, can I?
*: 
	So how about this? The only one of its kind found anywhere in the world, the famous Fortuna slime curio!
*: 
	I wanna say ten thousand gold coins for this fine article, but I just can't resist givin' you a discount, pardner! So how about five thousand?
*: 
	Hot dog! You're really gonna buy this slime curio from me for five thousand bucks?
*: 
	You got yourself a deal, pardner! I'll just put it right into your bag there for you and take that cash off your hands. Thank you kindly!
*: 
	Okay, pardner. You're the boss!
*: 
	Still too much for ya, huh, pardner?
	I'm pretty attached to it myself, you know...
*: 
	Beggin' your pardon, pardner, but I ain't got a single curiosity left in stock.
*: 
	It ain't like the good old days now. Travellin's a dangerous game, an' I don't get out much to find
	new stock.
*: 
	Hiya! Welcome to the casino. Relax, play some games, and have %H0860%Xyourself%Yyourselves%Z a great time!
*: 
	They never give you gold back, no matter how many tokens you win.
*: 
	The best way to enjoy the fun's to buy tokens with any leftover gold you have, but not to break the bank.
*: 
	Listen to this!
*: 
	The monster I backed's about to win!
*: 
	Go on! That's the way!
*: 
	There are three types of slot machine. There are single-token, ten-token and hundred-token machines.
*: 
	Always best to start off with the single-token machines, if you want my advice.
*: 
	This is the casino's one hundred token
	mega-attraction!
*: 
	I finally did it! I won a hundred tokens on the
	slot machines!
*: 
	That makes me even for today. I got back what I lost. Not bad for a day's work.
*: 
	I can't wait to be among the performers who get a changing room to use.
*: 
	Where's the stunning young beauty come to
	steal a prince's heart? What? She's behind me?
	Oh, no she isn't!
*: 
	It's weird. I'm losing my voice here. I won't be able to perform soon. Ahem! Ahem, ahem!
*: 
	There's people from all walks o' life in this here town. The good, the bad and the ugly.
*: 
	And it looks like you've had your fair share of suffering to me.
*: 
	Have ya heard about the legendary hero?
	Everyone's speculatin' about whether he's
	gonna show or not.
*: 
	I've got a thousand G down that says he does!
*: 
	These dancers aren't bad.
*: 
	Don't disturb me now, pal!
	This is a really good bit!
*: 
	La la la Ⓠ,
	Can't express my love,
	But ooh... Ⓡ
*: 
	La la la Ⓠ,
	Please, baby, ooh,
	I need you... Ⓠ
*: 
	Well? Do you think the way I dance is classy too, honey?
*: 
	You wanna join in the dance, sweetie pie?
	Sure! Just swing those hips!
	Da-da-daa, Da-da-da-daaa Ⓠ
*: 
	You look like you've got rhythm.
	Come on, sugar, let's dance!
*: 
	Oh, yeah! You sure can move!
Heidious
	Wow! That's one heavy costume!
	And real princesses wear this kind
	of thing all the time?
Wicked stepmother
	It's my job to support the lead. It's one of the most difficult acting roles there is, you know.
Cindy
	You get to meet all kinds of people travelling
	around. It's great experience. It helps me brush
	up my acting skills.
Carla
	Wow! What a hero, getting, like, sooo many monsters to join you. You're way cool!
Carla
	But with that many monsters already part of your team, you're gonna find it hard to recruit any others.
Carla
	If you wanna, like, get some other monsters to join the party, you better say bye to some of these guys, huh?
