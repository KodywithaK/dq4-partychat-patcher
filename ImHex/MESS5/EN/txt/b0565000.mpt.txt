Bianca
	Is this Nadiria? I think it must be, there's a horrible feelin' in the air.
Nera
	So we're finally here. You can tell this is the beginnings of the underworld from the sinister
	feeling in the air.
%0%a001240
	Dad... This place has got a really scary feel to it.
%0%a001250
	Um... I'm feeling a little bit s-scared here.
%0%a001240
	Don't worry, sis. I'll look after you.
%0%a001250
	I know, %a001240...
Sancho
	Now we have come thees far, your Uncle Sancho, he ees ready! Sí, he ees ready like the
	beeg plate of paella!
Tuppence
	I say! I never imagined I'd f-find myself in a p-place like this.
Tuppence
	Dear me. I'm afraid I'm rather on edge. So much so that I can't even muster a joke.
Bianca
	That voice... Do you think it could've bin your mum's?
Bianca
	I know it's hard to believe, but she sounded
	so gentle...
Nera
	Did you hear that, darling? Your mother isn't far away now. Let's move on.
Nera
	Your mother must have some amazing powers to be able to send us a gift out of nowhere like that.
%0%a001240
	Can you hear me, Grandma? I'm your grandson, %a001240! We're coming to rescue you!
%0%a001240
	That's a relief, isn't it, Dad? She doesn't seem to be angry that we're here.
%0%a001240
	I'll bet she's glad to see us, really. All grannies like to see their grandchildren!
%0%a001250
	Grandma...
%0%a001250
	So this is a sage's stone. I saw a picture of one
	in an old book once, but I've never seen one for
	real before.
Sancho
	Señora Mada! I, I, I... (sob)
	I no hear thees voice for eso long!
Sancho
	Ees no far now, friend!
	Your madre, eshe ees thees way.
Tuppence
	Good heavens! What an exquisite stone! I can sense a very mysterious power within it too.
Bianca
	Come on, %a000090. We dun't want to hang around here any longer than we have to.
Nera
	Now we're here in Nadiria, there's just one thing for us to do. We should hurry.
%0%a001240
	I'm going to try really hard, Dad. We'll defeat the Grandmaster of the Underworld, you'll see!
%0%a001250
	Everything's alright, isn't it, Dad? We're all here, so everything's going to be fine, right?
Debora
	Urgh. This place has a horrible feel to it.
	It's certainly not normal.
Debora
	That voice... Was that your mother, %a000090?
	It won't be long now before you meet her.
Debora
	Your mother certainly has some impressive powers up her sleeve.
Debora
	To be able to speak with us even when she's in the clutches of the monsters... I can understand why Nimzo sees her as a threat.
Debora
	Now we've come this far, there's only one thing left for us to do. Let's go, everyone!
