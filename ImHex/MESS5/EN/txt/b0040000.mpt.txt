Rodrigo Briscoletti
	At last! There you are, %a000090. Stopped off somewhere along the way to enjoy a bit of the dolce vita, did you?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I've decided the wedding will take place on my casino ship, the Ventuno. It's far, farfalle away in the north-east, but it'll be well worth the trip.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I was hoping to sail there, but the seas are dangerous these days.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	However, Prince Harry here has just informed me of another way we could get there.
Harry
	Hello, %a000090! You look well.
	I haven't seen you in ages.
Harry
	We rushed over here as soon as we received the invitation from Mr Briscoletti here.
Harry
	I hope you don't mind that I let on about your magic abilities. We were talking, and it just slipped out that you know how to cast Zoom.
Maria
	Congratulations, %a000090!
	It's wonderful news!
Maria
	And what a generous father-in-law. The wedding will be absolutely amazing by the sound of it.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ha ha hah! That's right! No expense spared!
	So, %a000090, will you do the honours?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Once you get us in the air with your magical extravaganza, I'll be able to direct you.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Are you all set?
~ %0%a000090 casts Zoom. ~
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Love of linguine!
	Now this is alfresco!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	What's the problem, %a000090?
	Is my daughter to marry a scaramouch!?
	Cast the spell!
*: 
	%0%a000090...
	Come on, %a000090...
Debora
	Finally! You're awake at last. I did tell you how I hate layabouts, didn't I?
Debora
	Oh well...
Debora
	Just make sure you've got yourself together by the time I walk down the aisle. I'll need you to look stunned, not stewed.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ah, back with us at last, are you?
	Hmph. Well, scusi me for tiring you out, %a000090.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I don't like to disturb your little siesta like this, but the wedding ceremony is about to start, and the groom is required!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	This good man will explain the plan of action to you.

Priest
	We are gathered here in the presence of the Goddess, to witness the blessed union of %a000090 and Debora.
Priest
	All turn to face the rear of the deck for the entrance of the bride, please!
Priest
	Dear Goddess. Thank you for guiding these two souls to meet here, on this most joyous of days.
Priest
	May you bless them with your eternal
	love and happiness.
Priest
	Now we will move on to your vows.
Priest
	Do you, %a000090, take Debora to be your wife?
Priest
	To love and to cherish, in sickness and in health, for as long as you both shall be resurrected from death in the church?
Priest
	And do you, Debora, take %a000090 to be
	your husband?
Priest
	To love and to cherish, in sickness and in health, for as long as you both shall be resurrected from death in the church?
Debora
	What's it to do with you? I don't see why you're asking me all these questions!
Priest
	I, I, er... Well! I...
	You, you must exchange rings, then...
~ %0%a000090 and Debora place their wedding rings on each other's fingers. ~
Priest
	So, in the presence of the Goddess, you will
	now demonstrate to everyone here that your
	union is complete.
Priest
	You may kiss the bride!
Harry
	Come along, %a000090! Don't be shy!
	Give her a sloppy one!
Debora
	Well? You can kiss me, but make sure you do it properly! Don't embarrass me, %a000090.
~ %0%a000090 kisses Debora! ~
Priest
	Dear Goddess, behold this new union of two of your devoted flock!
Priest
	Bless them with your everlasting love and watch over them with your eternal compassion.
Harry
	Congrats, %a000090!
	You two make a great couple.
Bianca
	Congratulations, %a000090!
	You too, Debora. I hope you'll be really happy together.
Nera
	Congratulations, Debora!
	I'm so happy for you.
Nera
	And %a000090... I do hope you'll find happiness with my sister.
~ %3And so %a000090 and Debora are wed.%4 ~
~ %3Unfortunately, there's no time to enjoy the casino, as %a000090 must transport everyone back to Mostroferrato.%4 ~
~ %3But the celebrations there continue long into ~
~  the night...%4 ~
~ %3And then, day breaks...%4 ~
Debora
	Oh, you're awake at last!
	It's evening already, you know.
Debora
	You're almost impossible to rouse once you're asleep, aren't you?
Debora
	But I suppose you must've been tired, what with having to Zoom everyone back here straight after the ceremony.
Debora
	Well, I hope you enjoyed your lie-in, because from now on, you'll be getting up before me every morning.
Debora
	That's why I married you, you know.
Debora
	You seem like the kind of man who's willing to do anything for me. Anything and everything I want!
Debora
	I expect to be treated like a princess. You'll have to attend to my every need. I won't accept anything less.
Debora
	Well? Is that clear? Can I rely on you for absolutely everything...hubby?
Debora
	That's what I like to hear! And without a moment's hesitation, either. You've always been besotted with me, haven't you? From the very beginning.
Debora
	Right, that's enough chatting. We should be getting on our way soon.
Debora
	You're going to carry on travelling in search of your mother, aren't you?
Debora
	Well if I stayed at home, how would I be able to tell you what to do?
Debora
	So I'm coming with you, darling. I'll be right by your side, watching every move you make. Okay?
Debora
	You catch on quickly, don't you? I like that. It's good that you know where you stand.
Debora
	I'll tell you now so there's no misunderstanding later. I don't take kindly to being told what to do. That's my job.
~ Debora joins %a000090! ~
Debora
	Right, well... I suppose we'd better go and tell Papa the good news!
Debora
	Chop, chop, you!
Debora
	Oh? So you think you're going to be deciding what's best for us, do you?
Debora
	Well, I'll overlook that little outburst of defiance just this once, but if you try to tell me what to do again, I will not be happy. That's my job.
Debora
	Sorry? My ears must still be ringing after all the rapturous applause I received at the wedding ceremony. Let me ask you again...
Debora
	Can I rely on you to put my needs ahead of yours, without compromise, and to do absolutely everything I ask?
Debora
	That's better. Next time I ask you a question, you'd be wise to agree straight away. It just saves time.
~ The bag feels unusually heavy. ~
~ %0%a000090 has a look inside... ~
~ Wow! There's a pair of sticky honey buns in there. ~
~ Mr Briscoletti gave them out to everyone in Mostroferrato to mark the special occasion. ~
Debora
	Hold on, you!
Debora
	I said we have to go and tell Papa we're leaving first, didn't I?
Debora
	What? Are you tired? Well I'm not going all the way home now! We'll spend the night here, alright?
Debora
	I'm shattered. See you in the morning!
Debora
	Come on, rise and shine!
	It's high time we left.
Debora
	Well stop messing around, then! We're leaving!
*: 
	I've got to hand it to you, %a000090. I mean, marrying Debora... Phew!
*: 
	But that still leaves me with a chance of wooing Nera. Ha ha! Look out lady, here I come!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Finally, they make an appearance! I was worried,
	but now that I see you together, I can tell you belong together like spaghetti and Bolognese sauce!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I'm afraid Prince Harry and his wife had to leave early this morning.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	But he had some very interesting things to say about %O0960%Xyou, you know, %a000090%Y%a000090, you know%Z.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I hear you're travelling in search of a
	legendary hero.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Well, I believe I have just the thing for you.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You'll find some gifts from me in the two chests behind me here. They're both unlocked. The contents are yours.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Now then, Debora. While %a000090 is away, Iⓚⓛ
Debora
	Yes, about that, Papa. I've decided I'm going to go with him.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I see... Well, I can't say that I'm surprised. I had a feeling that would be your preference.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	But the sort of adventures %a000090 is embarking on are too dangerous for you. You will stay here with us.
Debora
	What!? Well, if %a000090 gets lonely and runs off with another woman, I shall hold you personally responsible, Papa!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Holy rigatoni! What a thing to say of your faithful husband, Debora! Nevertheless, that wouldn't do at all...
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ah-ha! I have an idea!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I own a small shrine on a little island to the west of Stockenbarrel. I call it the Pothold.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	It contains a jar, you see. I've been thinking for some time now that I'd send %a000090 there to check on its condition.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	If you can manage that little errand without getting under %a000090's feet, Debora, I'll allow you to do as you please.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Well? That's fair, no?
Debora
	What a waste of time! If anyone's going to be slowing anyone down, it'll be %a000090, not me. Not that I intend to wait for him if he does, mind you.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	So it's settled? Good! Here you are then, Debora.
	I'll give you the key to the shrine.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I'm counting on you, %a000090.
	Remember, you're family now!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I just need to know what colour the jar is.
	It's on an island to the west of Stockenbarrel. Capice?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You'll find some gifts from me in the two chests behind me here. They're both unlocked. The contents are yours.
Debora
	What's the point in this stinking old place?
Debora
	Never mind. We'll just do what we came to do and leave as quickly as possible, got it?
~ Debora unlocks the shrine door. ~
~ %0%a000120 has a look at the pot. ~
~ It's glowing with a calm, blue light. ~
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ah! Welcome back!
	So it all went well, then?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I see. The jar was blue.
	Well, that's a weight off my mind.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Anyway. Never mind about that now!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	So, %a000090... Was my daughter able to assist you?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Really? You wouldn't be lying to me now, would you? Telling me prosciutto-pies?
Debora
	Look, Papa. You heard %a000090. He said I helped him, so what's the problem?
Debora
	You know, if you keep on worrying like this all the time, you'll go bald.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I...I...
	You have hurt your Papa, Debora.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Fine! Do as you please. This discussion is finito! Just don't get under %a000090's feet!
Debora
	Why would I get under his feet? I never got under yours.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You neverⓚⓛ!? Ahem!
	We're wasting time now. %0%a000090, you must leave now to find this legendary hero you seek.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Oh, yes. One of my ships is in dock at Lodestar Harbour at the moment. Take it! I've got plenty more!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	It's to sea-faring vessels what tiramisu is to desserts ⓚⓛ the best there is! Ready for any voyage you care to embark on. So make use of it soon!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Take care, now.
	Don't do anything crazy!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	And come home if you get tired. Your family's always here for you.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Once the world's safe again, we'll all settle down and make a good life for ourselves here, hm?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I'm not surprised! Debora can't even wield a sword, can she?
Debora
	Hey! That's enough, Papa!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Now everything's settled, you must get going.
	The Bolognese won't make itself, eh?
	You have a legendary hero to find, %a000090.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Although it's a shame for a newly-wed couple not to take some time for a little amore before setting off on such a difficult journey.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Do you know the island just east of
	Lodestar Harbour?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	That's where the Ventuno is moored.
	My casino ship, where you were married.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	That whole extravaganza was so hectic, you didn't have any time to enjoy yourselves.
	Why don't you take a short break there now?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Just mention my name to the man who runs the
	ferry over to the ship, and he'll see that you're shown around.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	If you carry on sailing south from there, you'll come to a place called Helmunaptra.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You can start your main journey from there.
	But remember, be careful!
Romana
	I'm so happy to have gained such a wonderful son.
Romana
	You can think of me as your own mama.
	I'll always be there for you.
Romana
	Debora, you be nice to %a000090.
	Don't take advantage of his kind personality.
Debora
	No, Mama...
Nera
	I have to confess to being ever so slightly envious at the wedding. You both looked so happy.
Nera
	Well...this is your house now too, %a000090. You will always be welcome here.
Nera
	And Debora... Please be careful.
Debora
	If you're tired already, I suppose it'd be okay for you to have a rest here. Well? Do you want to?
Debora
	Alright. But the bed's far too narrow for two.
	You can sleep on the floor.
Debora
	You're awake now, are you?
	Right then, let's get going.
Debora
	Just so long as you're not too tired. I don't want you collapsing while we're travelling. I could really damage my nails dragging you to an inn.
Nera
	Zzz... Zzz...
Debora
	Mind you, the rougher you look, the more dazzling I'll be!
Debora
	Just mind your own business and get on with it. Hurry up and get all your holy babble out of the way!
Harry
	And, er...can I just have a word in your ear, %a000090? That is one good-looking bride you've found!
Debora
	I suppose you did fly us all here. I'll let you off this time.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	No... But it would slow you down far too much to take Debora with you, %a000090. Hmm...
