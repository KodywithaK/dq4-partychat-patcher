~ %0%a000120 doesn't appear to have a high score yet. It's, it's really very upsetting. %A0110%XHis%Z%B0110%XHer%Z b-bottom lip st-starts to w-w-w-wobble... ~
~ %0%a000120 reads the explanation on the board: ~
~ ⓗIt's time to Bruise the Ooze, and sock it to the slimes that poke their pointy heads out of the eight apertures! ~
~ ⓗThree types of sloppy slimes will be taking cheeky peeks at you from their hidey-hole hoozes. ~
~ ⓗThere are boring old blue slimes, run-of-the-mill red slimes and super-slick, lickgooty-split silver slimes! ~
~ ⓗAt each level of the game you'll have to stretch yourself and whack the three types of wobblies in a different order. ~
~ ⓗWatch the four panels above the holes and bop the blobs in turn as their pictures plop up. ~
~ ⓗFail to jab the jelly jinxes in the right order, and the rockbomb will roll your way, so brace yourself for...ka-BOOM! ~
~ ⓗOnce your time's up, you looze. Game over! ~
~ ⓗIf you muddle through without missing a single slime, you get a goo at a bonus level too. So, try to top the high scores, and...bruise that ooze!ⓘ ~

~ This is no time to be playing games! There's some serious thinking to be getting on with. ~
~ The Bruise the Ooze game seems to be out of action at the moment. ~
