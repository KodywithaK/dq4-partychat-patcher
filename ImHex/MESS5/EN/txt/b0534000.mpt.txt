Bianca
	Blimey! It's bin a long time since we were last here. This is where them nice folk helped me when I fainted.
Nera
	The last time we were here, I was still pregnant with %a001240 and %a001250. It's hard to believe now when you see how they've grown.
%0%a001240
	This is Battenberg! I know because I've been here lots of times before with Sancho and %a001250.
%0%a001240
	I said to Sancho ages ago how I wished I could show you the view from here.
%0%a001240
	It made him cry! I'm not sure what I said that was
	so bad.
%0%a001250
	I don't like being too close to the edge, Dad.
	Can we walk where the path's safer?
Sancho
	I know ees a very nice view from here, but ees
	no esafe to walk too close on the edges of the cliffs.
Tuppence
	Brrr. This place is freezing. Even the scorching desert is starting to seem like a soft option
	compared to this.
Sancho
	The first time, I come here together weeth señor
	Pankraz and hees young bebé.
	The next time, Uncle Sancho, he ees all alone.
Sancho
	Then, the next time I pass through thees Battenberg, ees together weeth %a001240 and %a001250.
Sancho
	And now we are here again. The time, where does eet go? You grow up eso fast! Ees, ees... (sob)
%0%a001240
	I already knew that!
	I knew this was Battenberg!
%0%a001240
	He's lying! There have been monsters here a while now. I saw them the last time I was here.
%0%a001250
	Even if there were no monsters, it's such a difficult climb up here that I doubt many people would visit.
Tuppence
	You could wear iron armour or even stone
	armour as if it were light as a feather, couldn't
	you, %a000090?
%0%a001250
	It's weird that that iron mask of his is so heavy.
Bianca
	Ha ha! We only look young for it because we were turned to stone all them years!
%0%a001240
	Now I've travelled so much, I've realised how things normally are. People's dads are usually older than you are.
%0%a001250
	I don't care whether you're young or old as long as we can be together, Dad.
Sancho
	You no take no notice of thees señor.
	He no esay the nice theengs, eh?
%0%a001240
	Hopefully Mum loves you like she should do, Dad.
%0%a001240
	If not, does that mean she'll age really quickly?
Bianca
	That means it's your fault if I start agein', %a000090! You make sure you keep me good
	and young, eh?
Nera
	I carried on loving you even during all those years I was turned to stone. That must be why I didn't age.
%0%a001250
	I wonder if eating lots really does make you big and strong. %0%a001240 should definitely eat more vegetables.
%0%a001240
	It doesn't make any difference to me knowing that something's good for me. If I don't like it, I don't like it.
Sancho
	When you are just a leettle bebé, friend, you no like eso many foods. You no even like the paella!
	Uf, ees eso hard for the cooking.
Tuppence
	It's always the same for me. I try to overcome a dislike of something and eat it against my better judgement...
Tuppence
	And, lo and behold, the taste of it makes me gag! Sometimes you have to trust your intuition on these matters.
Bianca
	I hope the kids'll eat plenty of good food an' grow up to be big an' strong.
Nera
	It's a real test for a mother's cooking skills, trying to get her children to eat things they don't usually like.
%0%a001240
	Adults always pretend to us kids that they're never fussy about food. That's so cheeky!
Bianca
	We need to set an example to the kids an' not be fussy about what foods we eat. I'm directin' that comment at you, by the way, %a000090!
Nera
	You can be a bit fussy with your food, can't you, darling? Do you think you might eat some of the things you dislike if I cook them for you?
%0%a001240
	Wow! A Batten binnacle! These things were all sold out and impossible to get hold of before.
Sancho
	The people, they are esaying you no find these binnacles no more. The artisan who ees making them, he ees too old. We are lucky, eh?
%0%a001250
	Ooh! We could use a Batten binnacle to find our way when we get lost in caves and places!
%0%a001240
	Yeah, we'd never lose our Batten binnacle!
	It's far too useful.
Sancho
	Thees old man, he looks eso tired.
	We leave heem to esleep, no?
Bianca
	Whether he's quite a man or not, they could
	hardly just get on with things and not even
	bother lookin', eh?
Nera
	The only reason we can be together again today is because of everyone's efforts to find us. We mustn't forget that.
%0%a001240
	You were turned into a statue right after I was born, Dad. So that makes it...yep! About eight years!
%0%a001250
	I wasn't only looking for you, Dad. I was looking for Mum too. It was horrible not having a mum.
Bianca
	I'm sorry, %a001250. I promise not to leave you again, ever.
%0%a001250
	I wasn't only looking for you, Dad. I was looking for Mum too. It was horrible not having a mum.
Nera
	It was horrible for me to be without you too, %a001250. But we'll be together for always from now on.
Tuppence
	I wish I could point out to him that the person
	he's talking about is right in front of him. That
	would be fun!
%0%a001250
	Phew. I can relax a bit in here. It's too scary outside, what with all the big drops and everything.
%0%a001240
	That man gave us some juice the last time we
	were here.
Sancho
	Ees no the time for esitting down for the
	dreenks and the paella, eh? For now, we
	have eso much to do.
%0%a001240
	Two generations means Mum and Grandma, right? But we'll go the rescue, won't we, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I was really sad being without a mum. You must've been sad growing up without your mum too, Dad.
Sancho
	Maybe ees esome kind of destiny.
	You and your father, you travel the esameⓚⓛ
Sancho
	No! I no allow you to esuffer the esame fate
	like your father, friend! Ees for thees we are travelling now.
Bianca
	It dun't look like there are any other towns or villages 'round these parts, so we should probably try and rest here.
Nera
	It's nice to see this place is the same as always.
%0%a001240
	We used to stay here a lot back when we were searching for you and Mum.
Sancho
	Thees place, ees the territory of Gotha.
Sancho
	Ees good to esee how all the people een the kingdom leeve, no?
Tuppence
	Who would've expected to find a lovely bunny girl out in the sticks like this? Maybe it's fate...
%0%a001240
	Cool! They've still got their campaign going.
%0%a001240
	We couldn't make use of it when we were here with Sancho because there were only three of us.
Tuppence
	How lovely it is to see a bunny girl here! Just the kind of refreshment you need after a long journey.
Tuppence
	How lovely it is to see a bunny girl here! Just the kind of refreshment you need after a long journey.
%0%a001240
	I don't really get it, but is she basically saying just to live life to the full with no regrets?
%0%a001250
	That old woman's really nice. You can tell as soon as you set eyes on her.
Sancho
	My life, eet has the meaning because I am looking for señora Mada, señor Pankraz, señora %a001230 and you, friend.
%0%a001240
	Yay! I always hoped I'd be able to get the special prize one day.
%0%a001240
	I always thought to myself how I just needed to find Mum or Dad and then there'd be four of us!
%0%a001250
	We only qualify because we found you, Dad! It'll be like a prize to %a001240 and I for all our hard work!
Sancho
	Ees eso esad for %a001240 and %a001250. Every time when they hear about thees offer, I esee their leettle hearts breaking.
Sancho
	They no esay eet, but I know ees been eso hard for them weethout their mother.
%0%a001240
	Let's stay here, Dad! I always wanted to have a group of four so we could get the special prize.
%0%a001250
	The Order of Zugzwang... It's such a scary name!
	I don't like the sound of it one bit.
Tuppence
	A real beauty? Well, I wouldn't mind running into her!
Sancho
	But before they esee señorita Bianca or
	señora Mada, they no know what ees
	the real beauty, eh?
%0%a001250
	The Order of Zugzwang... It's such a scary name!
	I don't like the sound of it one bit.
Tuppence
	Ooh! She sounds like just the woman for me!
Sancho
	Thees woman, eshe esounds like Nera, eh?
	Nera, eshe ees eso pure, sí?
	I wonder where ees eshe now...
%0%a001250
	The Order of Zugzwang... It's such a scary name!
	I don't like the sound of it one bit.
Sancho
	You know, Sancho, he believes een these holy theengs. But the Goddess, eshe no take the money. Ees no right. I no like eet.
Tuppence
	A female priest. Hmm, what a pretty picture!
Bianca
	It en't enough for us to just put a stop to the Order of Zugzwang.
Bianca
	Nope. We have to see things through and go to Nadiria too.
%0%a001240
	The world won't come to an end. Not with us working so hard to stop that from happening.
%0%a001250
	I can feel it too. There's a sinister aura all around.
%0%a001240
	Do you think that means there are some baddies over in the west? How do we get there to sort them out?
Sancho
	Ees no only een the west. I feel thees aura, eet covers the whole world like the sombrero.
%0%a001250
	That poor little slime. It's not his fault. He just fell in with a bad crowd, that's all.
Sancho
	Chilli con carne! You theenk ees true?
	The monsters, they are attacking because
	their bosses, they geeve them these orders?
Bianca
	It's night already. We shouldn't push on any further. Let's stay here, eh?
Nera
	This place never changes!
	Shall we stay here the night?
Nera
	I always feel at ease when I'm somewhere that's the same as before. Maybe it's because I look the same after all those years as a statue.
%0%a001240
	We stayed here a lot when we were out looking for you. I really like this place!
Sancho
	Thees place, ees the territory of Gotha.
Sancho
	Ees good to esee how all the people een the kingdom leeve, no?
Tuppence
	Who would've expected to find a lovely bunny girl out in the sticks like this? Maybe it's fate...
%0%a001240
	Yay! They've still got their offer on!
	Let's all stay here, okay?
%0%a001240
	We couldn't make use of it when we were here with Sancho because there were only three of us.
Tuppence
	How lovely it is to see a bunny girl here! Just the kind of refreshment you need after a long journey.

	You know, Sancho, he believes een these holy theengs. But the Goddess, eshe no take the money. Ees no right. I no like eet.

Bianca
	It en't enough for us to just put a stop to the Order of Zugzwang.
Bianca
	Nope. We have to see things through and go to Nadiria too.
%0%a001240
	The world won't come to an end. Not with us working so hard to stop that from happening.
Bianca
	Even crossing the treacherous desert is bearable with all of you by my side.
Nera
	I can't believe how strong the sun is!
	And yet we made it here again.
%0%a001240
	Argh! I'm boiling! I don't think I've ever been this hot in my life. I want a bath!
%0%a001250
	Ouch! I've got sand in my eyes.
Sancho
	Friend...hahh...
	You walking...hahh...eso fast...hahh...
Sancho
	Ees...hahh...eso hot...hahh...
	I...hahh... I no...hahh...can breathe...
Tuppence
	It's not fashionable any more to have a tan. I'd appreciate it if we could move on to our next destination before I catch the sun.
%0%a001240
	That dog must be so hot! Or maybe it's used to the heat because it lives here.
%0%a001250
	That dog's really nice. He stays here all the time so the old man doesn't get lonely.
%0%a001240
	This place is quite small, but they have everything! It's like a secret den!
%0%a001240
	Hey! When we get home to Gotha, we could build a secret den for me, Dad!
%0%a001250
	Aaah. It's nice and cool in here. What a relief.
%0%a001240
	Oh yes! I think I did see a big tower somewhere along the way. I wonder how you get to it, though.
Sancho
	Right up to the heavens?
	Ees very, very tall, no? Ees no the place for Sancho. I wait at the bottom and eat paella.
%0%a001240
	Yikes! I didn't expect to find anyone down here!
%0%a001250
	I got dripped on just now.
	Well water is really cold, isn't it?
Bianca
	It's nice and cool down a well. I wonder what it'd be like to live here.
Nera
	It's hard to relax down a well. I'm too worried I might be making the drinking water all dirty.
%0%a001240
	It's gone a bit cold now. Can I cover myself up with your cape, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I'm sleepy. And cold. Huh!
Sancho
	The desert ees eso hot een the day.
	But ees eso cold een the night.
Sancho
	We must find esomewhere to estay the night, friend. Otherwise, maybe we all catch the esneezes.
Tuppence
	Urgh! The cold here is making my nose run terribly.
Bianca
	It's a bit chilly, eh? Warm me up, %a000090!
Bianca
	Oops! Mustn't embarrass the kids, I s'pose.
Nera
	The temperature really drops off at night. Shall we turn in now, darling, and get some rest?
Bianca
	Aah, that's nice and warm. It's amazin' what a difference a tiny bit of heat makes.
Nera
	The old man's trying to get some sleep.
	We mustn't disturb him.
%0%a001250
	This place is nice and warm. It's making me all sleepy.
Sancho
	We must estart looking for the place to estay the night esoon, no?
Tuppence
	A home in the desert. How delightful! I hope I have my own home one day too.
%0%a001250
	He's a clever one. He's on guard to make sure no monsters come along.
%0%a001240
	This place is nice. I'm all sleepy now.
Sancho
	The tower, ees very old, sí?
	I wonder who ees building eet...
	And how long ago...
Bianca
	We dun't have anythin' we need to do here, right, %a000090? We should hurry up and get to Nadiria.
%0%a001240
	Our castle looks so tiny from all the way up here!
%0%a001240
	Don't worry about me. I could handle a mountain pass like this on my own if I had to.
%0%a001240
	Er... Up there and down there... Um... Oh! Now I'm lost!
%0%a001250
	I'm not very good in high places. I'm always too scared to look down. Can I stay in the wagon, please, Dad?
%0%a001250
	It's at times like this that I wish I was a bird!
Sancho
	These mountain roads...hahh...always they are eso hard...hahh... Hahh... Hahh...
Sancho
	Friend...hahh...
	Ees no time...hahh...for siesta...hahh...?
Tuppence
	I came here lots of times when I first
	became a soldier.
Tuppence
	It's these treacherous mountains that make Gotha such a safe place to live.
Tuppence
	If only they were about ten times more treacherous, then we'd have nothing to worry about at all.
%0%a001240
	Some people like climbing mountains just for fun, though, don't they? Maybe he's one of them.
Sancho
	Ees no esafe for esuch an old man to be alone een the place like thees.
%0%a001250
	Why don't we just use Zoom? There's no need for us to come to such a scary place any more.
Bianca
	This really is a tricky path. It's almost impossible to keep goin' in a straight line!
Nera
	I feel like I've been all lop-sided for most
	of this journey! It certainly is hard work climbing mountains.
%0%a001240
	Ha ha! These paths are really funny. It's impossible to stand up straight.
%0%a001250
	I don't like this path. I keep thinking I'm going to fall.
Bianca
	You're not really plannin' on doin' this climb, are you, %a000090? Dun't we need to get a move on to Nadiria?
Nera
	I thought we were supposed to be going
	straight to Nadiria.
%0%a001240
	Mountain paths are fun! I love climbing!
Sancho
	The prayer ring...hahh...?
	Ees good...hahh...sí?
	Very...hahh...good...
Nera
	I can't believe Papa sent a messenger all the way out here!
%0%a001240
	We got a present from Grandpa Briscoletti? Cool!
%0%a001250
	That man was here when we came through last time. I wonder if he's been waiting for you all those years.
Nera
	What a wonderful thing to send to us.
	How generous of Papa!
%0%a001250
	Ooh! Flowing dresses are really expensive, aren't they? Grandpa Briscoletti's really generous.
Bianca
	This place is givin' me the willies. How d'you suppose that skeleton ended up over there?
Nera
	There's a horrible cold feeling to this place.
	I'm probably just imagining things, but it feels sort of sinister.
%0%a001240
	I don't remember coming here when we were
	with Sancho.
Bianca
	I dun't much like the sound of that old woman's laugh. She sounds like a witch or somethin'.
Nera
	I probably shouldn't really say so, but I'm not all that taken with the old woman. She makes me feel a bit uneasy.
%0%a001240
	Heh heh heh. Be careful, Dad. Heh heh heh!
%0%a001250
	I'm really tired, but I definitely don't want to
	rest here!
Bianca
	She wasn't a bad old stick, after all. I feel bad for doubtin' her now.
Nera
	I feel so guilty for doubting such a kind old lady. It looks like I still have a lot to learn when it comes to judging others.
%0%a001240
	Aaah, that was a good sleep. What's wrong, Dad? Your eyes are all red.
Tuppence
	I kept dreaming about sharpening pencils last night. Very bizarre!
Sancho
	We, we are eso lucky.
	We are just the passers-by.
	Ees eso kind to let us estay here.
Bianca
	That strange laugh is enough to give anyone
	a fright!
Nera
	Waaah! I'm frightened! That old woman's laugh really is scary!
%0%a001240
	Heh heh heh!
%0%a001240
	What do you reckon, Dad? Am I doing a good impression of her or not? Heh heh heh!
Tuppence
	It's sometimes a bit tricky to tell whether people are male or female when they get old. I wonder why.
Bianca
	Are you sure we've really got time for this
	kind of thing?
Nera
	We should save the trip down memory lane for later, %a000090. We need to focus on the job in hand.
%0%a001250
	I don't mind this cave because it's not too hard to walk about in.
Sancho
	Eh, where ees the exit?
	Ees thees way? No, ees thees way...
%0%a001240
	We got really lost when we came here with Sancho.
	It was a right pain.
Tuppence
	If I had to state a preference, I'd say towers are more my cup of tea than caves.
Tuppence
	I suppose I just like being able to see the sky.
Bianca
	It was a bit tough on me the last time I was here, tryin' to get through this place bein' pregnant and all.
Nera
	Did it make you angry that I hid the fact I was pregnant when we climbed up here all those
	years ago?
Nera
	I can understand that. But I had faith that everything was going to be alright.
	I can't explain it, but I just knew.
Nera
	Sorry I didn't tell you. But I had faith that everything was going to be alright.
	I can't explain it, but I just knew.
%0%a001240
	Look out, Dad! There's a rock sticking out there.
%0%a001250
	%0%a001240 really likes places like this. He gets all excited by them for some reason.
Tuppence
	This cave is all rock, so it's not so bad. The ones that are more earthy are all damp and nasty.
Tuppence
	I always feel like I smell of mould when I've been in a cave like that. I keep checking my skin to make sure I haven't turned green!
%0%a001240
	I've never travelled about on my own.
	I wonder what it's like.
Sancho
	Thees padre, he ees brave travelling all alone.
	Ees because the Goddess, eshe watches over heem.
%0%a001250
	That man was all on his own the last time we
	were here. It must be lonely travelling without
	any companions.
Bianca
	The last time we were here, I was carryin' our babies inside me.
Bianca
	I probably overdid it a bit then, but they were still born healthy, thank the Goddess.
Bianca
	What are we doin' here, %a000090? Are you feelin' a bit nervous about goin' to Nadiria?
%0%a001240
	It's really good fun chucking yourself down holes in this place!
%0%a001250
	I don't like it here. I don't like climbing and I'm scared of all the dropping down too.
Sancho
	Thees cave...
	Ees, ees eso...
Sancho
	No! I no let myself become esentimental now.
	Come. We must keep moving.
Sancho
	The estrength of Gotha, eet comes from the nature.
	Eet protects the castle. Ees a good location, sí?
Tuppence
	It has to be ladies first when we're doing all this dropping down from a great height. I mean, it's
	only polite, after all.
Bianca
	You should be careful not to go droppin' things about the place, %a000090! I dun't remember droppin' that, mind.
Nera
	What a nice old man, finding our belongings for us like that. I'm not sure we dropped it in the first place, mind you.
%0%a001240
	Did you drop it, Dad? I know I didn't.
Tuppence
	Ooh, yes! That's mine! I dropped it!
	...Actually, no. I'm fibbing.
%0%a001250
	There's a liar in our midst.
Sancho
	Thees man, he worries that esomeone has lost esometheeng of value. He, he ees eso kind.
Bianca
	%0%a000090! That flowin' dress en't ours! You mustn't tell lies like that!
Nera
	You really shouldn't tell fibs like that. It's wicked. You know that flowing dress doesn't really belong to us.
%0%a001240
	Did you drop it, Dad? I know I didn't.
Tuppence
	Ooh, yes! That's mine! I dropped it!
	...Actually, no. I'm fibbing.
%0%a001250
	There's a liar in our midst.
Sancho
	Eef we drop thees dress, you no theenk we notice?
	Are you esure eet belongs to us?
Bianca
	Wow! Look at all these things we've got! Just goes to show honesty's the best policy!
Nera
	I do hope it's alright for us to take all these things off that old man. Wasn't he generous!
%0%a001250
	Were we being tested?
%0%a001240
	So we got all that stuff because we told the truth? I get it. That means lying doesn't pay.
Tuppence
	Ah, I see what he was up to! Dear me. I would've fallen at the first hurdle and taken the T 'n' T ticket!
Sancho
	Thees man, he ees estrange maybe?
	You theenk he ees loco?
%0%a001240
	One hundred years! That's amazing! He's kind of like a god of the mountains, then!
Bianca
	When we come through here before, it was sort of like a honeymoon, eh, %a000090?
Bianca
	I still feel the same way about you, but it certainly dun't feel like a honeymoon this time!
Bianca
	Bein' here makes it hard to imagine that places like Zenithia and Nadiria really exist.
Nera
	I was so scared the last time we were here in this cave. I didn't think all the leaping about could be
	at all safe.
Nera
	Gotha Castle seems to be doing alright. But we should stop in from time to time to make sure.
%0%a001240
	We came through this cave to Battenberg when we were looking for you.
%0%a001240
	It's like a labyrinth in here, though. We got lost more times than I could count!
%0%a001240
	Yippee! I'm so happy you're here with us
	this time, Dad!
%0%a001250
	I came here before with Sancho and %a001240.
%0%a001250
	Neither of them has any sense of direction at all,
	so it was a real trial.
%0%a001250
	%0%a001240 and I came here once when we were inside Mum's tummy, didn't we?
%0%a001250
	I have this feeling that I remember Mum trying to protect us from being hurt each time she jumped down a hole.
Sancho
	I no like thees place. Every time I am coming here, I esure I get lost.
Tuppence
	I'm totally useless when it comes to remembering directions. Don't go relying on me, will you?
Debora
	I collapsed here once? No, I never did!
	I don't remember anything of the sort.
Debora
	Oh, but wait a minute... Now I come to think of it, this place does bring back a strange memory of the whole world spinning around.
Nera
	I suppose it's because time stood still for me when I was a statue all those years. I don't feel my age at all. Oh, it's all so complicated!
Debora
	I'll always look young and beautiful, no matter what happens. It's got nothing to do with me having been turned to stone all those years.
Debora
	So if I ever start to age, that'll mean I don't love you any more?
Debora
	You'll just have to make sure you stay loyal to me like you vowed so that never happens.
	Got it, %a000090?
Debora
	There are plenty of things I don't find very appetising to look at.
Debora
	Feeding them to me blindfolded is probably the best way to make me eat them. You'd enjoy that, no doubt, %a000090?
Debora
	I'd eat anything if someone told me it was good for my figure.
Debora
	I should think slimes are full of collagen, for example. Shall we try a bite of one, %a001250?
%0%a001250
	B-But... You're already b-beautiful enough, Mum! Please don't try eating a slime!
Debora
	Ha ha! You silly thing, %a001250! I was only joking. You're very gullible at times, aren't you?
	Just like your father.
Debora
	It stands to reason that our people would come looking for me when I went missing. And they were probably looking for you while they were at it too.
%0%a001250
	I was looking for Dad too, but it was you I missed most, Mum. It was horrible not having a mum.
Debora
	I know, %a001250. You're a wise little girl, aren't you? A lot like me.
Debora
	I'll have to teach you lots of things to make up for the time we were apart.
Debora
	I doubt there are many other places around here to rest. Looks like we'll be staying here for the night.
%0%a001250
	The Order of Zugzwang... It's such a scary name!
	I don't like the sound of it one bit.
Tuppence
	Ooh! If she's as beautiful as she sounds, I might be tempted to join the Order of Zugzwang myself!
Sancho
	Thees breengs to my mind how beautiful Debora ees. Sí, I wonder where ees eshe now...
%0%a001250
	I'm scared sometimes, but I'm going to try my hardest. It would be horrible if the world ended.
	I wouldn't be able to see the people I love.
Nera
	You put a stop to the Order of Zugzwang, but that obviously wasn't the end of it.
Nera
	I'm afraid we have no choice but to go to Nadiria.
Debora
	You put a stop to the Order of Zugzwang, but I still say we need to teach whoever's responsible for this a lesson!
Debora
	We have no choice but to go to Nadiria.
Debora
	It's getting late now, so I think we'd better stay here for the night. I need my beauty sleep.

Debora

Debora
	I'm absolutely parched! Get me some water, %a000090. And I mean you, so don't go asking the kids to do it for you.
Debora
	It's funny, you might expect a well in a desert to be full of hot water, but it's not!
Debora
	One minute it's hot, the next minute it's cold...
	Oh yes, it's always a pleasure to be in the desert.
Debora
	I'm freezing. Warm me up, will you, %a000090? Just don't go stealing any of my body heat, though, otherwise you'll be in trouble.
Debora
	You come over here too, %a001240. And you, %a001250. We'll be able to keep warm if we all stick together.
%0%a001240 & %0%a001250
	Cosy!
	Yes, it's much warmer like this.
Debora
	It's quite comfortable here, I suppose. We can't stay here, though, so you'd better hurry up and find us an inn for the night.
Debora
	Ouch! What are you looking at?
	Don't just stand there! Give me a hand!
Debora
	We'll be...in Nad...iria before...long.
	Haah... I'm ab...solutely...ex...hausted.
Debora
	Can you believe Papa, sending a messenger all this way? He really is besotted with his little girl.
Debora
	This is for %a001250 and I to share. You don't mind, do you? It's a present from Papa, after all.
	And I don't think it would suit you!
Nera
	Um, darling, sorry to interfere, but this mountain path won't lead us to Nadiria. I really think we need to be on our way.
Debora
	I always feel exhausted just looking at this path. What are we doing here, anyway?
Debora
	There's nothing for us in this nasty place.
	Hurry up and get moving!
Debora
	Did you want to talk to that old woman for some reason, %a000090? You're not looking for a mother substitute, I hope!
Debora
	I've had enough, I really have.
	We're leaving. Now.
Debora
	I couldn't laugh in such a creepy way if I tried.
Debora
	I hope I'm wrong about this, %a000090, but I can't help feeling like you're trying to wear me out on purpose.
Debora
	The last time we came by here, I was carrying %a001240 and %a001250.
Debora
	It's lucky that I didn't fall or anything when I was climbing up and down these mountains.
Nera
	Being back in this cave really takes me back.
	The first time we passed through here, I was so excited that we were travelling around together.
Nera
	Darling, I feel just as sentimental about this place as you do. It's time we made haste now, though.
Debora
	What are we doing here? We don't need to be here, right? So let's hurry up and head to Nadiria.
Debora
	I know Nadiria isn't going to be a bundle of laughs, but I'd rather be there than stuck in this cave.
	I'm going!
Debora
	I didn't notice you dropping anything.
	You're always so clumsy!
Debora
	I know I shouldn't doubt you, but I do hope you weren't lying just then.
Debora
	I knew you were honest. You were true to your feelings and chose to marry me, after all.
	Do you think he really did find all those things?
Debora
	This place is just the same as it was all those years ago. Much like my beauty. It hasn't faded one bit in all this time.
Debora
	You couldn't give a shout or something to warn me when you're about to jump down a hole, could you?
	I need to take my shoes off or I might break a heel.
