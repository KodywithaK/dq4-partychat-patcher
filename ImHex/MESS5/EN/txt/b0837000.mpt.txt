*: 
	I don't know why, but I was drawn to this place, as if by the strength of someone's will. Someone as yet unknown to me.
*: 
	It is all in the Goddess's grand plan, I have no doubt. I just hope I can be of use here.
*: 
	Well, hel-lo! You must be the exciting new knick-knack expert. The new curator? Excellent!
	I'm Annette. People call me Exotic Annette.
Exotic Annette
	This is the extra-special Exotica Net Expo where you exhibit and exchange exemplary knick-knacks with other excentric explorers.
Exotic Annette
	Let me explain%O0960%X, %a000090%Y%Z. You're not exclusive, you see. There are other knick-knackerers in this expansive world of ours.
Exotic Annette
	Exchanging exotic knick-knacks, or ⓗexoticaⓘ, with external exhibitors is exactly what Exotica Net is all about!
Exotic Annette
	And you can experiment with exotica yourself here too. You can invent your own knick-knacks for export to other worlds.
Exotic Annette
	Curators of exhibitions like yours will be extremely happy to send an example of their own original exotica back to you too.
Exotic Annette
	So, have I extolled the virtues of Exotica Net
	enough to excite you? Don't be excluded from
	the fun, okay?
Exotic Annette
	I'm sure you don't want to be excluded from the fun, do you? The exciting world of exotica awaits!
Exotic Annette
	But first you must extract a few more of the knick-knacks from this world. Otherwise you'll never be able to craft an original work.
Exotic Annette
	I'm sure it won't take %H0860%Xan experienced explorer%Yexperienced explorers%Z like you long to acquire something in excess of five or six new knick-knacks though, will it?
Exotic Annette
	Hel-lo! And welcome to the Exotica Net Expo!
Exotic Annette
	I'm sure you don't want to be excluded from the fun, do you? The exciting world of exotica awaits!
Exotic Annette
	If you knock up an original knick-knack of your own, you can export it when you encounter an external exhibitor from another world.
Exotic Annette
	And in exchange, you'll extract a piece of exotica from him or her too. Isn't it extraordinary?
Exotic Annette
	Your newly acquired piece of exotica will be exhibited with extreme care in the expo hall.
Exotic Annette
	Of course, you can expect examples of your own expertise to be on display in the expos of the other worlds you encounter too.
Exotic Annette
	So, er...stop exterminating time and let's get creative! Expediency is the key!
Exotic Annette
	What type of knick-knack are you hoping to experiment with, then?
Exotic Annette
	It'll be an expression of your self, so expend some energy on choosing a form that you expect to be easy on the eye.
Exotic Annette
	Now it's time to give your exceptional piece of exotica a name...
~ Sorry, but that name's not exactly what we were expecting... ~
Exotic Annette
	Do you explicitly state that this design may be exposed as an original piece of %O0960%Xyour%Y%a000090's%Z craftsmanship?
Exotic Annette
	So, now you need to add an explanation of what this %a001430 is exactly.
Exotic Annette
	Excuse me!? You want to explore other options? We'll have to start again, then.
~ Sorry, but that's not exactly the kind of message we were expecting... ~
Exotic Annette
	Are you happy that the explanation of your %a001430 is expansive enough?
Exotic Annette
	Then I exceptⓚⓛ I mean, I accept your knick-knack into the collection! Exciting, isn't it!?
Exotic Annette
	Oh? It's lucky I asked then, isn't it?
	No problem. I'm very flexible, you know.
Exotic Annette
	Okay, then. Let's exhibit your %a001430!
Exotic Annette
	Ex-CELSIOR!
Exotic Annette
	Phew! That's...exquisite!
Exotic Annette
	Now, when you decide you'd like to have a little excursion into the extraordinary extravaganza of Exotica Net, come and see me.
Exotic Annette
	And don't worry, if you export your new knick-knack creation to another world, I'll conjure up an exact replica of it again.
Exotic Annette
	That means an example of your excellent work will always be on display here. So export extrovertly!

Exotic Annette
	So, what exactly is it that you'd like to do?
Exotic Annette
	It seems your %a001430's been discovered already. How expedient!
Exotic Annette
	That means you can expect to find some extraordinary new piece of exotica in the expo hall. Why don't you explore a bit?
Exotic Annette
	How did you like the Expo? Quite an exuberant display, isn't it? The exotica will fill up the pedestals one by one as you collect them.
Exotic Annette
	There are twenty-four exclusive pedestals in total. So that's the extreme limit of exotica you can import from other worlds.
Exotic Annette
	So, what exactly is it that you'd like to do?
Exotic Annette
	The Exotica Net Expo's gaining more and more exposure now.
Exotic Annette
	Well done, %a000140. Keep up the excellent work and keep giving Exotica Net a go.
Exotic Annette
	Hel-lo, %H0860%X%a000120%Yeveryone%Z!
	This is extra extraordinary!
Exotic Annette
	All that physical and mental exertion has paid off. The expo is exploding with exotica exhibits! It's full!
Exotic Annette
	It's extremely exciting for me to be exvolⓚⓛ
	I mean, involved in all this.
Exotic Annette
	Now if you want to rearrange the Expo, you'll need to expel some of your old exhibits to expose space on the pedestals.
Exotic Annette
	To explore the exciting world of Exotica Net, you and your party must extricate yourselves from your adventures for a while.
Exotic Annette
	You're expected to confess your experiences to me so that I can record them in an adventure log.
	Is that ex-ceptible?
Exotic Annette
	Into which adventure log should I commit this excerpt of your adventures?
Exotic Annette
	In that case, I must exterminate the existing
	ⓗ%a000660: %0%a000090 %a000240ⓘ adventure log.
	Do I have your express permission?
~ Saving adventure log. ~
~ Do not turn the power OFF ~
~ or remove the DS Game Card! ~
~ There was a problem saving the adventure log. Please turn the power OFF and reinsert the DS Game Card. ~
Exotic Annette
	Excellent! Your exhilarating adventure log has been excreted safely! Ready for an excursion into the world of exotica?
Exotic Annette
	You can't expect to participate in Exotica Net without saving the details of your %a001430 in an adventure log first.
Exotic Annette
	Do you want to make a hasty exit from the whole experience?
Exotic Annette
	Here we go then... I'm exporting your %a001430 now!

Exotic Annette
	Oh, how inexcusable!
	I've let the expo hall get full!
	There's no extra space on the pedestals!
Exotic Annette
	You'll need to expel some of your old exhibits to expand your exhibition space.
~ You can't initiate DS Wireless Communications ~
~ right now. ~
Exotic Annette
	It's excruciating to have to exile any exotica that you've so expertly extracted from other worlds, but...
Exotic Annette
	Well, when the Expo's space is exhausted, you can't exchange any new exotica, so it's really perfectly excusable.
Exotic Annette
	Here's a list of the exotica on display now...
Exotic Annette
	%0%a001470?
	If you expel it from the Expo, you'll probably never come across it again. Are you extra certain?
Exotic Annette
	Alright then! %0%a001470 makes an exit from the Expo!
Exotic Annette
	Do you want to expel anything else at this stage?
Exotic Annette
	No, I'm not surprised you've had a change of heart. Exotica are so exclusive, aren't they?
Exotic Annette
	Oh, you've explored all your options here for now, have you?
Exotic Annette
	Are you sure I can't extend any further assistance to you?
Exotic Annette
	I'm extremely happy that you came to spend some time at the Exotica Net Expo. I can't wait 'til the next exciting time.
Exotic Annette
	You'd like to change your knick-knack? Well, it's quite complex. You'll have to explicitly choose everything about it all over again. Is that alright?
Exotic Annette
	So, what type of knick-knack are you hoping to experiment with this time? Take your pick...

Exotic Annette
	Oh, dear. I'd like to expose the list of exotica to you, but the Expo's just an expanse of empty pedestals at the moment.
Exotic Annette
	You'd like to exempt a piece of exotica from the Expo? But...it doesn't look like you have any exotica yet.
