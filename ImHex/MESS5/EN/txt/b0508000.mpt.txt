Bianca
	They did a good job of buildin' a castle all the way out here.
Bianca
	I feel like I'm about to collapse in all this heat! I s'pose we'll look back on our ⓗhot honeymoonⓘ one day and laugh, though, eh?
Nera
	I'd love to have a proper look at the castle, but
	I can hardly keep my eyes open with all this sand flying about.
Nera
	It must have been terribly hard work for the people who built this here.
Nera
	Fancy Papa sending a messenger all the way out here! He really is a worrywart, isn't he?
Nera
	He's sent us some money. We should accept it gracefully. I'm sure that would make him
	really happy.
Bianca
	That poor man! We should help him find some water.
Nera
	Oh dear! We can't just leave him lying there.
	We must try to find him some water.
Bianca
	He's a sharp one, eh? Leapin' up to do business with the folk who just saved his life!
Nera
	Here's hoping that he doesn't end up in such a sorry state again.
Bianca
	Yeah, it definitely dun't sound like a good idea, goin' huntin' about without a hat in this heat.
Nera
	I should think it's too hot for treasure hunting even with a hat. I certainly wouldn't feel up to it.
Bianca
	Rocks in the shape of a rose? That sounds weird. We'll have to have a look for one of those if we get the chance.
Nera
	I've seen one of those before.
	They really are curious things.
Bianca
	I've had my share of rows with my own dad, but it's never got to the point where I've stormed out and run away.
Nera
	I've never once had an argument with either of my parents. Is that not the norm?
Bianca
	Wouldn't it be handy if the legendary hero was actually here? I doubt we'll get that lucky, though.
Nera
	We hear talk of the legendary hero wherever we go, but they speak of him an awful lot here, don't they?
Bianca
	Oh, right. I didn't know the legendary hero was the child of a Zenithian. I wonder how you'd go about meetin' 'em.
Nera
	Of course. The legendary hero had the blood of
	a Zenithian.
Bianca
	It's lovely and cool and refreshin' in here. I feel like I've got a new lease of life all of a sudden.
Nera
	They keep this place incredibly clean, don't they? There's hardly a speck of sand to be seen.
Bianca
	That's a shame. It's goin' to be hard to find the legendary hero's descendants if we dun't know
	what happened to 'em.
Nera
	Maybe the legendary hero's descendants are just living quietly somewhere like normal people. 
Bianca
	Blimey. He did well, eh? First he was mates with the legendary hero, and then he built his own castle!
Nera
	That must be why there's so much talk about the legendary hero here. The person who built the castle was a friend of his.
Bianca
	Well, we en't heard news of the legendary hero appearin' back on the scene yet. I s'pose that means the world's not in too bad a state still.
Nera
	Do you think that means we have to wait until the world is on the brink of disaster before we can meet with the legendary hero?
Bianca
	If they're guardin' the legendary helm ready for when the hero comes back, maybe we'd be better
	off just waitin' for him here.
Nera
	I wonder if the rest of the Zenithian Equipment is being looked after in the same way elsewhere.
Bianca
	Surely you can't really practise your swordsmanship against a dummy?
	Nope, the best way is to go into battle for real.
Nera
	Kaaah! Hii-yaaah!
Nera
	He he he! Sorry. It looks like that soldier's enthusiasm must be catching.
Bianca
	It dun't look like the Queen's in her throne room, eh?
Nera
	Her Majesty obviously doesn't care too much
	about form. It's unusual not to find a royal in their throne room.
Bianca
	Sounds like it won't be long now before the legendary hero puts in another appearance.
Nera
	Maybe the legendary hero doesn't realise his
	true identity.
Nera
	Otherwise, how can he just stand by doing nothing while the world falls deeper and deeper into crisis?
Bianca
	Crikey! I never expected to see all this greenery in the middle of the desert!
Nera
	What a beautiful garden!
	It's like entering another world.
Bianca
	Hmm. Sounds like the Queen here is quite
	somethin', eh?
Nera
	It certainly is a very impressive garden.
Bianca
	How embarrassin'! As long as you think I'm a beauty, %a000090, that's all I care about.
Nera
	He he! I may look pure, but looks can be
	deceiving. You know that better than anyone,
	don't you, darling?
Bianca
	Hmm. So desert roses crop up in places where there used to be water.
Nera
	I wonder if that means the whole world was once covered in greenery.
Bianca
	Blimey! That Queen Cleohatra's quite a looker,
	en't she?
Bianca
	What she said was pretty interestin' too. We should get her to take us to the legendary hero's grave.
Nera
	The legendary hero's grave? I'd like to see that.
	We should have her show us where it is.
Bianca
	Now's not the time to stand about chattin', %a000090! Her Majesty's already on her way.
Nera
	She's very fast on her feet, isn't she? We'd better hurry, otherwise we might lose sight of her.
Bianca
	There's a lot to talk about, but our first priority should be tryin' on that helmet.
Nera
	We can talk later. First and foremost, you need to try on that helmet.
Bianca
	The Queen seemed a bit disappointed, eh? We should probably go and have a word with her.
Bianca
	I was startin' to think that it really might be you, %a000090.
Bianca
	But you can't equip the Zenithian Sword neither, so it can't be. Still, I do feel like there's somethin' a bit special about you.
Nera
	It seems that Her Majesty is trying to find the legendary hero too. Her method is just a bit different to ours.
Nera
	Perhaps we should go and speak with her again before we leave, darling?
Bianca
	I reckon we should tell her the situation. You never know. She might be able to help out.
Nera
	You're being rather cautious aren't you, darling?
	I'm sure that Her Majesty can be trusted.
Bianca
	King Pankraz... Searchin' for his wife with his infant child... That can't just be a coincidence.
Nera
	That sounds just like you and your father.
	Do you think you could be a prince?
Bianca
	We should head off to that Gotha place in the east and see what it's all about.
Nera
	The eastern kingdom of Gotha... We could probably find out all kinds of things if we went there.
Bianca
	I thought it'd still be boilin' hot, but it gets pretty cold in the desert of a night, eh?
Nera
	It's so quiet in the desert at night. It feels like we've entered a world devoid of all sound.
Bianca
	Looks like we can't get inside the castle of a night.
	We should probably get some shut-eye anyway.
Nera
	If they won't let us inside the castle, there's not much we can do. We should probably rest for
	the night.
Bianca
	I do feel pretty feverish at the minute. Maybe I've gone and caught a cold.
Nera
	Atchoo!
Nera
	Brrr. I have been feeling a bit of a chill these last few days, actually.
Bianca
	Sounds like they've bin waitin' a pretty long time, eh? I s'pose it's possible that the legendary hero won't show his face durin' our lifetimes.
Nera
	So many people are waiting desperately for him, and yet still he doesn't appear. Maybe that means the world isn't in such bad shape after all.
Bianca
	It is pretty chilly. Another layer or two definitely wouldn't hurt.
Nera
	I'm feeling a bit cold now myself, I must say.
Bianca
	Rocks in the shape of a rose? That sounds weird. We'll have to have a look for one of those if we get the chance.
Nera
	I've seen one of those before.
	They really are curious things.
Bianca
	He can't fool us, eh? It's pretty obvious how worried he is about her.
Nera
	I'm sure time will heal this rift between them eventually. A parent and child can't stay angry
	at each other forever.
Bianca
	Yeah, I'd heard about how hot it gets in the day and how cold it gets at night, but I still never imagined it'd be this bad.
Nera
	Your body can probably become accustomed to living in all kinds of strange climates, given enough time.
Bianca
	Looks like that bloke has the hero on his mind constantly, even when he's asleep!
Nera
	We can only hope that the desperation of the people here to see the legendary hero will call out to him and prompt him to show his face.
Debora
	I'm sick of all this sand swirling about the place!
	It's all over my hair and ⓚⓛ look ⓚⓛ it's even got inside my clothes somehow!
Debora
	You're the one who said we should come here, so you'd better hurry up and fix this by finding us somewhere decent to stay the night.
Debora
	And it'd better have a bath too. Got it?
Debora
	How ridiculous of Papa to send a messenger all this way! He really is besotted with me, you know.
Debora
	So Papa sent me some pocket money. Well, I suppose it can't hurt to accept it. You can take care of it, though, %a000090.
Debora
	What a fool, travelling in the desert without enough water. I won't be able to sleep well if we just leave him, though, so you'd better help him out.
Debora
	The cheek of him, trying to make money out of the people who saved him from the brink of death!
	Still, it's his sort who do well in this world.
Debora
	It's far too hot for treasure hunting, hat or no hat.
Debora
	If you want to go off and do it, %a000090, you can go on your own.
Debora
	Papa showed me one of those ages ago.
	They're quite pretty, actually.
Debora
	You could try to find one for me if you like. I'll wait here, though. I don't want to risk getting sunburnt.
Debora
	I've had a few rows with Mama and Papa in the past where I ended up leaving home. I always just went and hid at Crispin's for a while.
Debora
	There's so much talk of the legendary hero.
	I'm starting to believe that he really did exist once upon a time.
Debora
	A legendary hero, a Grandmaster of the Underworld, a land called Zenithia...
	Are you sure this isn't just a faerie tale?
Debora
	It's nice to finally be somewhere comfortable again.
	I really can't stand the heat around here.
Debora
	So all we've established by coming here is that the legendary hero really existed. Huh! I want to know where he is now!
Debora
	So he became king just on the strength of being friends with the legendary hero?
Debora
	Well, I have my own personal servant so...
	I don't mind carrying on as we are, but it could be quite nice to become a queen.
Debora
	If the world's at peace, then there's no need for the legendary hero to show his face. That means we won't get to meet him.
Debora
	The hero will probably return here one day for the legendary helm. But there's no way I'm hanging around to wait for him!
Debora
	Urgh. It's too hot all over this place, but this room's not only hot, it smells of sweat too. Disgusting!
Debora
	I don't blame Her Majesty for not wanting to sit about here in this heat. She's probably gone off to find a nice, cool spot somewhere.
Debora
	I wish the legendary hero would pull his finger out and show his face. The nerve of him, keeping me waiting like this!
Debora
	How lovely of them to build a garden like this in the middle of the desert to welcome me. You could learn a lot from Queen Cleohatra.
Debora
	She blessed them with this garden?
	Sounds like she did more than just pay for it.
	Do you think she has some kind of special power?
Debora
	I suppose she means that roses have thorns.
	But flowers with soft petals alone are no fun, right, %a000090?
Debora
	I find it hard to believe that this desert was ever covered in greenery.
Debora
	The legendary hero's grave? I suppose we may as well go and have a look while we're here.
Debora
	What are you playing at, %a000090? There's no time for chat now. We'll lose sight of Her Majesty if we're not careful.
Debora
	Can you stop staring at me for one second and try on that helmet?
Debora
	If only you'd turned out to be the legendary hero.
	I don't suppose it could ever be that simple, though.
Debora
	Oh well. Queen Cleohatra seems fairly clued up, so we should go and see what else she has to say.
Debora
	It would've been so wonderful if you'd been able to put on that helmet.
Debora
	Imagine that! My personal slave the legendary hero! Just the thought of it gives me the shivers.
Debora
	You're being a bit overly cautious, aren't you?
	Just tell her the situation. No more messing around.
Debora
	Pankraz? Wasn't that the name of your father too? There's no way you could be a prince, though.
Debora
	I'm fed up with the sight of sand now.
	I'm leaving for the eastern kingdom of Gotha.
	You'd better come along too.
Debora
	It's so hot in the daytime that it feels like your skin's on fire, but at night it's freezing. I hate being in the desert!
Debora
	We'll have to try again tomorrow.
	It's late, and even I need a rest sometimes.
Debora
	Yuck! I don't want to catch a cold!
Debora
	I've already been feeling a bit under the weather just lately.
Debora
	There are quite a few more monsters about now than there used to be, and I'd hardly call the world peaceful, so come out, hero, wherever you are!
Debora
	What an idiot. Why didn't he come properly prepared? People like that really get on my nerves.
Debora
	Papa showed me one of those ages ago.
	They're quite pretty, actually.
Debora
	You could try to find one for me if you like. I'll wait here, though. It's too cold for me.
Debora
	Stubborn fool! No wonder his daughter decided to run away from home.
Debora
	I couldn't agree more.
	There's no way I'd ever live here.
Debora
	It's all ⓗhero, hero, heroⓘ, non-stop, night and day.
	He could give you a run for your money, %a000090, he's that obsessed.
