Bianca
	This place is pretty impressive, en't it?
	I had no idea there was a cave like this up through the lock.
Bianca
	I can't help feelin' a little bit nervous, though.
Bianca
	Reminds me of that time you and me went off ghost-huntin' when we was little kids.
Bianca
	It's so pretty!
Bianca
	It's bin a fair few years since I got to enjoy any scenery this amazin'.
Bianca
	There en't bin time for things like that since Mum died.
*: 
	Folk say there's some kind of special ring 'idden 'ere in this cave.
*: 
	You don't stand a chance of findin' it, though. I ain't 'ad no luck, so a fancy man with a bird in tow definitely ain't got what it takes!
Bianca
	What a horrible creature he was!
Bianca
	I wonder what he's doing all the way out here.
Bianca
	Wow! It all feels so mystical and strange. I never knew there were caves like this about.
Bianca
	But the spray from all that water could have us lookin' like drowned rats if we en't careful. Look out, eh, %a000090?
Bianca
	That's weird. I was sure we'd find the Circle of Water in there.
Bianca
	With a name like that, I thought it stands to reason it'd be hidden in a place like this.
Bianca
	That's weird. I was sure we'd find the Circle of Water in there.
Bianca
	I wonder if there's a room of treasures somewhere along the way that we've not come across yet.
~ The Circle of Water glows blue with holy water. ~
~ %0%a000120 finds the Circle of Water! ~
~ %0%a000180 acquires the Circle of Water! ~
Bianca
	We did it, %a000090!
Bianca
	Now you'll be able to marry Nera.
Bianca
	Um, %a000090...
Bianca
	...No, never mind.
	It doesn't matter.
Bianca
	If you marry Nera, you'll be able to get the Zenithian Shield, after all.
Bianca
	That'll bring you another step closer to what you've always bin searchin' for.
	Come on. Let's go!
Bianca
	Wait a minute, %a000090!
	You're not plannin' on leavin' me behind in the wagon, are you?
Bianca
	I want to go with you.
	Come on, dun't be a spoilsport!
Bianca
	Thanks!
	Let's get goin'!
Bianca
	Fine, go without me. See if I care!
	...Just be careful, okay?
*: 
	Welcome to Mostroferrato, ancient stronghold of the Briscoletti family.
*: 
	Unbelievable! You got the Circle of Water too!
*: 
	So, does this mean...? You've won. You're going to marry Nera! Wow, am I jealous!
*: 
	Apparently, Briscoletti's ordered the bride's veil from a big-shot item trader.
*: 
	A man called Crispin just crawled into town with really bad burns all over him!
Bingo
	Arf! Bau bau!
*: 
	You got the Circle of Water!?
	That's incredible!
*: 
	That explains why Mr Briscoletti's already started preparing for the wedding ceremony, then.
*: 
	You'd be quite a catch, wouldn't you?
*: 
	I bet Nera's having a hard time making up her mind which boy to choose! Hee hee hee!
*: 
	Welcome! We've got a drink to
	suit every taste in here!
*: 
	Crispin suffered some very serious injuries in that cave of molten lava.
*: 
	He's caused everyone a lot of worry, including Nera. Honestly, what was he thinking?
*: 
	Young Nera's been tending to Crispin
	night and day since the accident.
*: 
	But she tired herself out, the poor girl. She finally went home today, and not before time!
Crispin
	Urgh... Nera... My heart...burns for you...
*: 
	Stop lazing about and put some tea on,
	you old waster!
*: 
	Oh! You're not my husband!
	I, I do apologise.
*: 
	The wife's taking care of business again today.
	I'm in charge of making dinner.
*: 
	I don't know how things ended up like this.
	It all depends on what kind of a start you get off to, I think.
*: 
	Marriage is a blessed union of two souls in the presence of the Goddess.
*: 
	She will bestow happiness upon any couple who truly love one another.
*: 
	I've been asked by Mr Briscoletti to help
	plan the wedding.
*: 
	The same wedding at which I was very nearly the groom! Ha ha ha.
*: 
	This is Mr Briscoletti's villa. He doesn't get
	out here much, though. It's just that little bit
	too far away.
*: 
	Welcome to the Briscoletti residence.
*: 
	Really!? You've managed to get the
	Circle of Water?
*: 
	Don't waste any time, then. Bring it here as soon as you can.
*: 
	Mr Briscoletti isn't known for his patience!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ah, there you are, %a000090.
	You say you've managed to obtain
	the Circle of Water?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Splendissimo! That makes you the maestro, then!
	It would seem you, %a000090, are worthy of my bambina, Nera!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	As promised, I grant you her hand in marriage.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	To be honest, I couldn't resist getting the preparations underway already. I'm a soft old romantic at heart, you know! Ha ha hah!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Oh, yes. I must have that Circle of Water
	off you for now.
~ Mr Briscoletti takes the Circle of Water from %a000090. ~
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	The priest will give both rings back to you during the ceremony, of course.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Nera! I trust you have no objection to %a000090? He's a fine gentleman, after all.
Nera
	Well no, Papa...
Nera
	But...what about that young lady?
Bianca
	Eh? Me? Oh, no! I'm just an old childhood friend, is all. My name's Bianca.
Bianca
	Anyway. It's bin lovely meetin' you all.
	But I think I'll just be headin' off noⓚⓛ
Nera
	No, wait!
Nera
	Do you... Do you have feelings for
	%a000090, Bianca?
Nera
	And %a000090. Do you have feelings for Bianca?
Nera
	It wouldn't be right for us to get married if you do. You'd only live to regret it.
Bianca
	No, no, Nera. Really, it en't like that.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Nera! Calm yourself!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Tonight, %a000090 will take some time to think carefully about his choice. Nera or Bianca, that's the decision.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Now, how shall we do this?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Yes. %0%a000090, I will arrange for you to stay in the Mostroferrato inn tonight. I own it, so it won't be a problem.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Bianca, you will take my villa.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Do you understand, %a000090?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Fine. Think about it carefully, then. This isn't a decision you should make lightly.
~ %3That night, while staying in the Mostroferrato inn, %a000090 suddenly wakes up...%4 ~
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You'll need to be quicker than that to marry my daughter, lad! Listen carefully this time.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I'll give you some time tonight to think carefully about your choice. Nera or Bianca, that's the decision.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I'll put you all up in town for the night.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	%0%a000090, I will arrange for you to stay in the inn, as I said.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Bianca, you will take my villa.
~ There are more pressing concerns at the moment. ~
~ Like choosing a bride! ~
*: 
	Well! I heard all about your little dilemma.
	That's a tough one, eh?
*: 
	If you want my advice, I say pick both of them! But I suppose that's against the rules, eh? Ha ha!
*: 
	Zzz... Zzz...
	Thankzzz... You're really kind, Nera...
	Zzz... Zzz...
*: 
	Here's the man! Couldn't sleep, eh, %a000090?
*: 
	I don't blame you. It's a biggie, that's for sure. That marriage lark's a lifetime commitment.
*: 
	Go for a walk and clear your head.
	That'll help you get things straight.
*: 
	Come back if you get tired. The room's still yours.
*: 
	Things any clearer now?
	Think you can get back to sleep?
*: 
	Okay, then. Get some rest before the big announcement tomorrow, eh?
~ %3The following morning...%4 ~
~ %3%0%a000090 is summoned to the Briscoletti mansion.%4 ~
*: 
	Oh, you're %a000090, aren't you?
	You're the talk of the town now, you know.
*: 
	What to do, what to do...
*: 
	Bianca seems a bit strong-willed, but she's cheerful, and an absolute stunner to go with it.
*: 
	But you won't find a kinder, more honest girl than Nera. There's no doubt she'd make a fine wife.
*: 
	Apparently, Briscoletti's ordered the bride's veil from a big-shot item trader.
*: 
	Who are you going to pick?
*: 
	You can't go back on it once you've decided. I'd go to church and confess first, so you've got nothing else on your mind.
Bingo
	Aaarf, aaarf...
*: 
	Why do men only ever think about themselves?
*: 
	Don't our feelings count for anything?
	I bet Nera and Bianca can't sleep, either.
*: 
	Mind you, you're the quiet, sensitive type, aren't you? I suppose you've already thought of that.
*: 
	That Bianca girl you brought with you here,
	she's a fine specimen, she is.
*: 
	If you don't pick her, point her in my direction, would you? She can have a job here any day.
*: 
	If it was me, I'd pick Nera.
*: 
	You pick her, and you automatically get yourself that amazing family shield as well.
*: 
	What's there to think about!?
*: 
	Marriage is a blessed union of two souls in the presence of the Goddess.
*: 
	She will bestow happiness upon any couple who truly love one another.
*: 
	Is it true that Mr Briscoletti's given you permission to marry Nera?
*: 
	Well, I suppose you did work for it.
	Crispin will be crushed, of course,
	but still... I wish you every happiness.
*: 
	Ah-phew...
Crispin
	Urgh... Nera... My heart...burns for you...
*: 
	Zzz... Zzz...
*: 
	Stop sitting on the fence and give me an answer, you old waster! Who do you think he's going to pick?
*: 
	Oh! You're not my husband!
	I, I do apologise.
*: 
	Zzz... Zzz...
*: 
	Zzzz...
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You've impressed me, %a000090, managing to get both the Circle of Fire and the Circle of Water.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I like you! Even if you decide not to marry my daughter, I'll still arrange your wedding for you.
	I insist!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	No expense will be spared! I've already written the invitations to your friends.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Prince Harry and Lady Maria of Coburg, wasn't it?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	So, that's settled. Now I must get some sleep too.
*: 
	Ah-phew...
Nera
	Zzz... Zzz...
~ Nera seems to be sleeping soundly. ~
Bianca
	Oh, it's you, %a000090.
	Things have gone a bit squiffy, en't they?
Bianca
	But dun't you worry. Anyone can see you'd be crazy not to marry Nera.
Bianca
	I'll be fine. It's not like I haven't bin on me own
	up to now, is it?
Bianca
	Now you better get some sleep.
	You must be tired.
Bianca
	I'm goin' to stay here a little while longer and enjoy the evenin' breeze. I just can't sleep meself...
*: 
	Good morning, %a000090!
*: 
	Everyone's fit to burst, you know.
	Come along, this way.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	So, %a000090, have you given careful consideration to which girl you'd like to marry?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I can see it's been a very difficult decision for you. But it would be greedy to marry both! Ha ha hah!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	So! The time has come for you to make your choice, %a000090.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You will now propose to your bride-to-be: my daughter Nera, or your childhood friend, Bianca.
~ Leaving without proposing to the bride-to-be would really disappoint everyone! ~
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	What!? You little scaramouch! This isn't a decision to be made lightly, you know!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Still, I realise some people find it hard to
	interpret their own emotions. Nevertheless,
	a decision must be made.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Hot panini! You have feelings for me, %a000090!?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I, I like you too, but... No! No, no! That's not an option. You will reconsider.
*: 
	Don't be cheeky, %a000090! I might accept, and then you'd be in all kinds of trouble!
*: 
	All this reminds me of my courting days.
*: 
	Rodrigo was quite the Romeo himself, you know.
	He had to put himself in great danger to win my hand in marriage.
*: 
	He injured himself too. And I spent days and days looking after him at his bedside.
Bianca
	What!? You're pickin' me, %a000090?
	I'm not a lady like Nera is, you know.
Bianca
	Yes!? So you dun't think I'm a lady, then!?
Bianca
	But you still want to marry me instead of her?
	Are you sure about that?
Bianca
	I, I dun't know what to say, %a000090.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Then it's settled! I can't say I'm surprised.
	That's amore, after all!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Well, there's no time to sit around. We must get on with the preparations.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	The bride will get ready in my villa.
Nera
	Wait! I'll help!
Bianca
	No... You're right. Nera'll be much better for you than I could ever be.
Nera
	You know all I can be for you is a wife who relies on you for protection and shelter, %a000090?
Nera
	But you still want to marry me, despite that?
Nera
	Really? You really want me?
Nera
	That's wonderful! I'm so happy! Thank you, %a000090! I'll be the best wife you could ever imagine!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Then it's settled! I'm delighted that you've chosen to become a Briscoletti, %a000090!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Well, there's no time to sit around. We must get on with the preparations.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	The bride will get ready in my villa.
Bianca
	Wait! I'll come along an' help.
Nera
	How could you play games with my heart like that?
Nera
	I understand. Bianca will be able to do so much more for you than I ever could.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	So it's time for the big event at last!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I heard of a real maestro item dealer who
	trades out of a cave in a spa town up in the mountains near here.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I've already ordered the wedding veil from him.
	No expense spared!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I'd like you to go and fetch it for your bride, %a000090.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	By the time you return, the preparations will be done, and we'll be ready for action!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	What? Am I going to arrange the ceremony for you even though you chose Bianca?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	As sure as pasta's pasta, I am!
	Like I said, I like you!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Don't worry about Nera. She won't be
	short of offers!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I'd save the worry for yourself if I were you.
	In case you suddenly realise what a terrible
	mistake you've made! Ha ha ha ha hah!
*: 
	Oh, dear, oh, dear! Chased out of my own
	church! I was told I was getting in the way,
	would you believe?
*: 
	It's been crazy around here since morning, what with all the preparations for the wedding.
*: 
	You better hurry up and get that wedding veil sorted out as quickly as possible!
*: 
	Off limits, I'm afraid. Because of the wedding preparations, you see.
Bingo
	Aaarf! Bau bau bau!
*: 
	Bianca's still getting ready.
*: 
	Come back once you've picked up the veil,
	would you?
*: 
	Oh, hello! I bet it's going to be a fab wedding!
	Mr Briscoletti doesn't do things by halves!
*: 
	So you decided to pick Bianca in the end, did you?
*: 
	She's a real stunner, that one.
	You're a lucky man!
*: 
	So you decided not to marry Nera in the end,
	did you?
*: 
	Crispin's on the mend now too. I'd say things are looking up, wouldn't you?
*: 
	A wedding, eh? That takes me back.
	A long, long way back!
Crispin
	Zzz... Zzz...
*: 
	Well! Thanks to the wedding, I can put my feet up for a while.
*: 
	Briscoletti's going to pull out all the stops for this one, I'll bet. I mean, it's his precious little girl getting married!
*: 
	It's been crazy around here since morning, what with all the preparations for the wedding.
*: 
	You better hurry up and get that wedding veil sorted out as quickly as possible!
Bingo
	Aaarf! Bau bau bau!
*: 
	Ms Nera is still busy getting ready.
*: 
	You're needed to fetch the wedding veil, %a000090.
*: 
	Oh, hello! I bet it's going to be a fab wedding!
	Mr Briscoletti doesn't do things by halves!
*: 
	So you picked Nera in the end, did you?
	I hope you'll be very happy.
*: 
	Is it true that Mr Briscoletti's given you permission to marry Nera?
*: 
	Well, I suppose you did work for it.
	Crispin will be crushed, of course,
	but still... I wish you every happiness.
*: 
	A wedding, eh? That takes me back.
	A long, long way back!
Crispin
	Zzz... Zzz...
*: 
	Well! Thanks to the wedding, I can put my feet up for a while.
*: 
	I'm just discussing a few things with the priest at the moment.
*: 
	Mr Briscoletti's not sure if he wants the ceremony here in the church or somewhere else.
*: 
	If we go elsewhere, the priest will have to come with us, so he needs some time to get ready.
*: 
	Ms Nera is the apple of Mr Briscoletti's eye.
*: 
	I don't know where he'll decide to have
	the ceremony in the end, but I'll do whatever
	I can to help.
*: 
	Huh? Y-You're not thinking of Debora!?
	My Goddess, you must beⓚⓛ
	Well, let's just say rather you than me!
*: 
	Of course, Debora's a stunner too. But if I were to put her behind the bar, the punters would be so stunned, they'd all go home!
Debora
	Who do you think you are?
	Is there a sign on the door saying
	ⓗscruffbags welcomeⓘ?
Debora
	Oh? You heard I was the older sister out of Nera and I, did you?
Debora
	So? What of it? If you think that means I'm looking to get married first, you can think again.
Debora
	What is it now? Do you want something, or not?
Debora
	Hmph. I've heard what's been going on, you know, but I don't want anything to do with it.
Debora
	Don't get any ideas, okay? I step on men like you all the time. But you do look pretty strong... What am I saying? You'd be no match for me.
*: 
	Wait!
Debora
	You're %a000090, aren't you? Yes, quite the mystery boy. Nobody seems to know anything about you at all.
Debora
	Well, well... I never imagined anyone would actually manage to retrieve the Circle of Fire and the Circle of Water. Very impressive...
Debora
	I suppose that means I'll have to let you marry me.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Wh-What on earth is all this bologna, Debora?
	You're hardly a suitable match for %a000090.
Debora
	Oh, poor Papa. You're really not in touch with the way young men think any more, are you?
Debora
	Why don't we see what %a000090 has to say about it?
Debora
	Well, %a000090? Hurry up and pick me. I've no intention of marrying a dim-witted layabout.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ahem! Well! I, I must apologise for this, er...sudden little fiasco, %a000090.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	But take your time, compose yourself, and then let your heart decide. Will you marry my Nera, or young Bianca?
Debora
	What are you waiting for?
	Just get on with it and pick me!
Debora
	It's so obvious it's me you've wanted to marry from the beginning. Go on, admit it.
Debora
	I know you're a bit...lacking, but don't worry, I'll compensate for that. I'll keep you on the straight and narrow.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	A-Are you sure you know what you're letting yourselfⓚⓛ I mean, are you certain?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	B-By the Goddess, you are a lion-hearted man, %a000090.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I can't tell you what a worry Debora has been to us. I am most grateful to you.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Well, let's get the preparations underway pronto before you have a change of heart!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	The bride will get ready in my villa.
Bianca
	Wait! I'll come along an' help.
Nera
	And me. I'd like to help too.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	N-No. For your sake, %a000090, I think that's a wise decision. So, who will you choose?
Debora
	Oh, how cute! You're too proud to admit it.
Debora
	Suit yourself. But don't imagine the offer will stay open forever.
Debora
	Chuh! I always knew you were a puny little morsel. You just can't handle the thought of a woman like me, can you?
Debora
	Is there anyone out there man enough to marry me?
Debora
	What? It's too late to change your mind now. The offer has been withdrawn.
Debora
	I told you I wouldn't marry a slow-witted layabout.
*: 
	It's been crazy around here since morning, what with all the preparations for the wedding.
*: 
	You better hurry up and get that wedding veil sorted out as quickly as possible!
*: 
	I still can't quite believe it, you know. Choosing to marry Debora!
*: 
	That'll make for some interesting adventures, I'm quite sure!
Bingo
	Aaarf! Bau bau bau!
*: 
	Ms Debora is inside getting ready.
*: 
	You're needed to fetch the wedding veil, %a000090.
*: 
	Did I hear it right? You're going to take Debora for a wife? You'll be needing a stiff drink to go through with that decision!
*: 
	Mr Briscoletti cried when you said you wanted to marry Debora, you know.
*: 
	You really have done a most selfless thing.
*: 
	You haven't got much of a clue about women, have you? That Debora's trouble, you mark my words.
*: 
	Debora's future has been a constant weight on Mr Briscoletti's mind.
*: 
	I don't know where he'll decide to have
	the ceremony in the end, but I'll do whatever
	I can to help.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You don't need to explain. I understand, my boy.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	After all, if you'd chosen Nera, Debora would have been mortified.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	It's plain to see that you're a very thoughtful and caring young man, %a000090.
	One after my own heart, you might say!
Bianca
	We'll be able to go off travellin' together again, eh?
	I can't think of anythin' that'd make me happier.
*: 
	Welcome to Stockenbarrel!
*: 
	The baths are a-cookin', so the place be a bit full of folk just now.
*: 
	Purrr!
*: 
	That son of mine's only sayin' he wants to be a priest now, of all things!
*: 
	I dun't know what he gets up to, shut up indoors all the time.
*: 
	Well, well, well! 
*: 
	You be lookin' mighty pleased wi' yourself!
*: 
	Meow.
*: 
	Hello there. I bet you've come to relax in the water, eh?
*: 
	Just mind you dun't go soakin' too much.
*: 
	Wouldn't want to pass out, eh?
*: 
	Please, leave me alone. I'm trying to relax.
*: 
	I'll bet you're another one of those uptight fellas here to soak away your cares, en't you?
*: 
	Well enjoy it then, the water's lovely and warm!
*: 
	Oh well. Maybe next time, eh.
*: 
	If you're back for the weddin' veil, you'll be pleased to hear she's good and ready!
*: 
	There she is! All yours!
~ %0%a000120 receives the wedding veil! ~
~ %0%a000180 acquires the wedding veil! ~
*: 
	I'm busy studyin' to be a priest, you know.
*: 
	There's apparently some kind of religious order out there at the moment collectin' money to build a White King's Paradise or suchlike.
*: 
	They say they'll keep you safe even if the end of the world comes and all that.
*: 
	That daughter of Whitey's, Bianca, is a real hard worker.
*: 
	He's a bit weak now because of some illness or other, so she goes off all over the place takin' care of things for the both of 'em.
*: 
	She really has got her head screwed on,
	that one.
*: 
	Sorry, mate.
	Pub en't open durin' the day.
*: 
	You as well, eh? I don't blame you.
	The baths here turn up some real beauties.
*: 
	I'm talking about bath crystals, of course!
	The famous Stockenbarrel scintillating sinter!
*: 
	I'm afraid no good things in life come for free, though. What I'd really like is a desert rose.
*: 
	You sometimes come across them in the desert. If you could find me one, I'd be more than happy to give you some sinter in exchange.
*: 
	Wait a minute! Don't go telling any of the villagers about this, okay? This is just between you and me.
*: 
	En't you that ole friend of Bianca's?
*: 
	Dun't you go puttin' her into any danger, d'you hear? Else you'll have me to answer to.
*: 
	En't you that ole friend of Bianca's?
*: 
	I hear you're plannin' on gettin' wed.
*: 
	I thought I'd give you this by way of congratulations, like. It's nothin' much, mind.
~ %0%a000120 receives a seed of magic! ~
~ %0%a000180 acquires a seed of magic! ~
*: 
	Well done an' all that!
	Here's to the happy ever after, eh?

	I hear you're plannin' on gettin' wed.
*: 
	Well done an' all that!
	Here's to the happy ever after, eh?
Whitey
	Hello there, %a000090.
	Bianca not with you today?
Whitey
	Getting ready for the weddin'!?
Whitey
	Well, I never! So you're takin' my Bianca off my hands then, eh?
Whitey
	Thanks ever so much! Now I dun't have to worry about her no more, like.
Whitey
	I hope you'll both be very happy together.
Whitey
	Hello there, %a000090.
	Bianca not with you today?
Whitey
	Getting ready for the weddin'!?
Whitey
	Well, well. So you're gettin' wed to this
	Nera then?
Whitey
	I'm a bit disappointed, to be honest, but it can't be helped.
Whitey
	Bianca's a lovely lookin' girl, anyway.
Whitey
	She'll probably be beatin' 'em off with a stick before long. Ha ha ha!
*: 
	Meow.
*: 
	Well, well, well! 
*: 
	You be lookin' mighty pleased wi' yourself!
*: 
	(splish splash)
*: 
	Aaah! You can't beat havin' the baths pretty much to yourself.
*: 
	If you're back for the weddin' veil, you'll be pleased to hear she's good and ready!
*: 
	There she is! All yours!
~ %0%a000120 receives the wedding veil! ~
~ %0%a000180 acquires the wedding veil! ~
*: 
	There en't no veils out there better than them ones I make!
*: 
	I even made one by special order for a certain king once upon a time, I'll have you know.
*: 
	King Pankraz of Gotha it was.
	Not that I'm one to name-drop or anythin'!
*: 
	I'm busy studyin' to be a priest, you know.
*: 
	Goo! Goo!
*: 
	That husband of mine! He may as well up sticks and move to the pub, the amount of time he spends there!
*: 
	Zzzz...
*: 
	Ah-phew...
*: 
	Ah-phew...
	Bianca... Zzzz...
*: 
	There's apparently some kind of religious order out there at the moment collectin' money to build a White King's Paradise or suchlike.
*: 
	They say they'll keep you safe even if the end of the world comes and all that.
*: 
	I dunno, though. I've bin around a bit meself so I'm not so naive as some. The whole thing sounds a bit fishy to me.
*: 
	There's a chap called Whitey livin' at the far end of the village. That daughter of his is a real beauty.
*: 
	What I'd give to be able to marry that one! My right arm at the very least!
*: 
	No!? Marryin' 'er? Well I never! You lucky devil!
*: 
	Well, at least I get to keep me arm, eh...
*: 
	There's a chap called Whitey livin' at the far end of the village. That daughter of his is a real beauty.
*: 
	What I'd give to be able to marry that one! My right arm at the very least!
*: 
	He's gone an' fallen asleep over his drink again.
*: 
	The carpentry business has bin boomin' since Whitey and Bianca moved here.
*: 
	It used to take a good two years to build a house, but Bianca's place was up in no time
	at all.
*: 
	Dear, oh dear. The fella from the weapon shop's on his tenth already. His wife'll have his guts for garters when he gets home.
*: 
	Purrr...purrr...purrr...
Whitey
	Hello there, %a000090.
	Bianca not with you today?
Whitey
	Getting ready for the weddin'!?
Whitey
	Well, well. So you're gettin' wed to this
	Debora then?
Whitey
	I'm a bit disappointed, to be honest, but it can't be helped.
Whitey
	Bianca's a lovely lookin' girl, anyway.
Whitey
	She'll probably be beatin' 'em off with a stick before long. Ha ha ha!
*: 
	You mustn't keep the bride waiting!
*: 
	There can't be a wedding without the wedding veil.
*: 
	And Mr Briscoletti explicitly asked for %O0960%Xyou to bring it, %a000090%Y%a000090 to bring it%Z. It won't do if someone else in your party has it, or if it's in your bag.
*: 
	Thank you for bringing the veil, %a000090.
*: 
	Your timing couldn't be better. The bride's just finished getting into her wedding dress.
*: 
	Here's everything Ms Whitaker was carrying. I'll just pop it into your bag for you, shall I?
*: 
	There. Well, you'd better go in!
*: 
	Come along, then, %a000090. It's time to pop that beautiful wedding veil on your beautiful young bride's head.
Bianca
	%0%a000090...
~ %0%a000090 puts the wedding veil over Bianca's head. ~
Bianca
	Thanks, %a000090.
Bianca
	Looks like it's time for you to take me to
	the church, then.
*: 
	Oh, my! Doesn't the bride look a treat?
	Come along, then. It's time to go to the church.
Bianca
	Oops! What are you tryin' to do, %a000090?
	You should be takin' me to the church.
*: 
	You're all ready, are you? Wonderful. I'll lead the way to the church, then. Follow me.
*: 
	Hey! %0%a000090!
Harry
	It's been ages, hasn't it? We rushed over here as soon as we received the invitation from Mr Briscoletti.
Maria
	Congratulations, %a000090!
	It looks like the wedding is going to be
	absolutely beautiful.
Harry
	Just don't cock up the proceedings by trying to look all dapper or anything, %a000090!
Harry
	So, see you later then, I suppose.
*: 
	So, this is it! Time for the big entrance of the bride and groom! It's so exciting!
Priest
	We are gathered here today, in the presence of the almighty Goddess, to celebrate the happy union of %a000090 and Bianca.
Priest
	We will start with your wedding vows.
Priest
	Do you, %a000090, take Bianca to be your wife?
Priest
	To love and to cherish, in sickness and in health, for as long as you both shall be resurrected from death in the church?
Priest
	And do you, Bianca, take %a000090 to be
	your husband?
Priest
	To love and to cherish, in sickness and in health, for as long as you both shall be resurrected from death in the church?
Bianca
	Yeah. I do.
Priest
	Then we shall now move on to the exchange of the wedding rings...
~ %0%a000090 and Bianca place their wedding rings on each other's fingers. ~
Priest
	So, in the presence of the Goddess, you will
	now demonstrate to everyone here that your
	union is complete.
Priest
	You may kiss the bride!
Harry
	Come along, %a000090! Don't be shy!
	Give her a sloppy one!
Bianca
	%0%a000090...
~ %0%a000090 kisses Bianca! ~
Priest
	Dear Goddess, behold this new union of two of your devoted flock!
Priest
	Bless them with your everlasting love and watch over them with your eternal compassion.
Harry
	Congrats, %a000090!
	You two make a great couple.
Nera
	%0%a000090 and Bianca, I hope you'll enjoy every happiness together.
*: 
	(wolf whistle)
	That's one hot bride you've got there, %a000090! You treat her right!
~ %3And so %a000090 and Bianca are wed.%4 ~
~ %3The celebrations continue long into the night.%4 ~
~ %3And then, day breaks...%4 ~
Bianca
	Mornin', %a000090. Did you sleep alright?
	It's nearly noon already, eh?
Bianca
	It all feels a bit like a dream, really. I can hardly believe I'm married now!
Bianca
	%0%a000090...
Bianca
	I know I'm a bit rough and ready sometimes, but I hope I'll be able to make you happy.
Bianca
	Ha ha! I feel embarrassed even sayin' somethin'
	like that!
Bianca
	%0%a000090...
	Here's to a lifetime of bein' happy together!
~ Bianca joins %a000090! ~
Bianca
	Come on, then!
Bianca
	I s'pose we should go and pay Briscoletti a visit before we make a move.
~ The bag feels unusually heavy. ~
~ %0%a000090 has a look inside... ~
~ Wow! There's a pair of sticky honey buns in there. ~
~ Mr Briscoletti gave them out to everyone in Mostroferrato to mark the special occasion. ~
*: 
	Welcome to Mostroferrato, ancient stronghold of the Briscoletti family.
*: 
	That was some wedding, eh?
	Phew! What an occasion!
*: 
	I'm going to marry a really beautiful woman when I grow up too.
*: 
	Nice wedding, %a000090!
	Briscoletti does it again, eh?
*: 
	You do realise you could've inherited
	Mr Briscoletti's fortune if you'd married
	Nera, don't you?
*: 
	I still can't believe you chose Ms Whitaker.
Bingo
	Aaarf! Bau bau bau!
*: 
	Urgh. I drank far too much last night.
	Hair of the dog's the only answer!
	Glug, glug, glug, glug...
*: 
	Urgh! (burp)
*: 
	It's about time I got married too, I think.
*: 
	Always nice to see a customer marry such a fine young specimen. Well done!
*: 
	So you decided not to marry Nera in the end,
	did you?
*: 
	Crispin's on the mend now too. I'd say things are looking up, wouldn't you?
*: 
	A wedding, eh? That takes me back.
	A long, long way back!
Crispin
	No doubt Nera thinks I'm an utter dunce, now.
Crispin
	All I managed to do was make a complete fool of myself and cause her to worry, getting so badly burnt like that.
Crispin
	But I'll make a man of myself yet!
	I'll prove I'm worthy of her love!
Crispin
	Maybe then. Maybe one day, my love will
	love me back...
*: 
	Two people from different upbringings, joining as man and wife, setting off on a new journey together as a family...
*: 
	When I think about it, marriage is another example of the many wonders the Goddess has bestowed upon us all.
*: 
	Stop lazing about and put some tea on,
	you old waster!
*: 
	Oh! You're not my husband!
	I, I do apologise.
*: 
	The wife's taking care of business again today.
	I'm in charge of making dinner.
*: 
	I don't know how things ended up like this.
	It all depends on what kind of a start you get off to, I think.
*: 
	Welcome to the Briscoletti residence.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ah-ha! The happy duo! You look fine together.
	Yes, very fine!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Prince Harry and his wife left early this morning.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	He had some very interesting things to say about %O0960%Xyou, you know, %a000090%Y%a000090, you know%Z.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I hear you're travelling in search of a
	legendary hero.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Well, I believe I have just the thing for you.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	You'll find some gifts from me in the two chests behind me here. They're both unlocked. The contents are yours.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I've also arranged for you to have the use of one of my ships. It's moored at Lodestar Harbour for you whenever you want.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	It's to sea-faring vessels what tiramisu is to desserts ⓚⓛ the best there is! Ready for any voyage you care to embark on. So make use of it soon!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I like you%O0960%X, %a000090%Y%Z. You're solid.
	As solid as a stale panini!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	So! I wish you all the best on your
	adventures together.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Steer a course south from Lodestar Harbour and you should eventually come to what's known as
	the desert queendom of Helmunaptra.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Mind you, you're newly-weds, aren't you? You must stop off on the way for a little honeymoon.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	If you head east from Lodestar Harbour instead, you'll come to my casino ship, the Ventuno, and
	the little town of Pontoon.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Mention my name, and my staff will see you're given the best suite on the vessel!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	And you should go and visit some of your old
	haunts too.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	There must be plenty of places from your youth that you haven't visited for a while, hm?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	So! I wish you all the best on your
	adventures together.
Romana
	If you're worried about Nera, there's really no need.
Romana
	I know she'll find a wonderful husband before long. Call it women's intuition.
Nera
	I was green with envy seeing the two of you so happy as you walked up the aisle!
Nera
	I hope you'll come and visit us again sometime.
	You're always welcome.
Nera
	Maybe I might even be married the next time you come! You never know!
*: 
	Travelling's better with two than one.
	And better with three than two, if you see
	what I mean.
*: 
	The more the merrier!
Bingo
	Aaarf! Bau bau bau!
*: 
	I lost my wife some time ago. She was killed by monsters while I was away travelling once.
*: 
	So make sure you look after your wife,
	won't you?
*: 
	Zzz... Zzz...
	Why don't I have a mum?
	Where'zzz she gone...? Zzz...

	Always nice to see a customer marry such a fine young specimen. Well done!

*: 
	What? What bad stuff? Well, there's the evil darkness that's ⓚⓛ Hic! ⓚⓛ going to swallow up the whole world for starters...
