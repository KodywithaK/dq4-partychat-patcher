	It's funny to find a house hidden in the woods
	like this.
%0%a001240
	Wow! Did you hear that, Dad?
	You can get to the Realm of the Faeries from here!
%0%a001240
	You spent some time with a faerie once, didn't you, Dad? That means you must be able to see them!
Sancho
	Uf! Now ees a forest we get lost een?
	Thees quest, ees no easy, eh?
Tuppence
	So if I can find my way through this forest, that'll prove that I'm someone special. Right then!
%0%a001240
	Ha ha! We've already been to the
	Realm of the Faeries!
Sancho
	I hope ees no eso hard to go there thees time.
%0%a001250
	I saw a funny shadow just then.
	You don't think...?
Tuppence
	It's funny how she remembers being a little girl.
	I don't remember being a little boy. I suppose I must've been in Gotha.
%0%a001250
	Does that mean you can't see faeries any more
	when you grow up? If that's true, I never want to grow up!
%0%a001240
	This forest goes on forever! It'd be a never-ending job looking after all these trees.
%0%a001240
	Hang on! Which way did we come from again?
	Can you remember, Dad?
%0%a001240
	You've met a faerie before, right, Dad? What was she like? Was she taller than me?
%0%a001240
	And could she fly? Did she have wings? Do you think she'd be my friend? Tell me everything!
%0%a001250
	The trees here in the forest are saying that they never let bad people through, but we're good, right?
%0%a001250
	My hair ribbon's come undone again. It keeps getting caught on the branches of the trees.
%0%a001250
	Look! Over there!
	...Oh. It's disappeared.
Sancho
	Maybe ees gonna take a long time to get
	out of thees forest, no? Now I weesh I pack
	the cold paella.
Sancho
	You know, once señor Pankraz, he eshow me the way to get out of the maze. But ees no gonna work here, I theenk.
Sancho
	Ees muchos dangerous eef you run
	around weeth no purpose. You must take
	eet eslow now.
Tuppence
	My life of brilliance is about to start right here! You have to guide us through this forest, %a000090!
Tuppence
	That's odd. This path looks rather familiar.
	I do hope you're concentrating, %a000090!
%0%a001240
	I've heard about the Realm of the Faeries from Sancho. Do you know much about it, Dad?
%0%a001240
	I don't know what Mum looks like, but I'll bet she's even more beautiful than the Faerie Queen!
%0%a001250
	I'd really love to live in the Realm of the Faeries.
%0%a001250
	Is there a land for faeries and a land for monsters?
	Um, which one do you think this is?
%0%a001250
	Um, is it okay if we go and play in the Realm of the Faeries again soon, Dad?
Sancho
	We no have anytheeng to do here een the forest, eh, friend? We leave now, okay?
Sancho
	You must no lose thees faerie horn, okay?
Sancho
	Esometimes you have the careless moment, eh, friend? Ees true, sí?
Tuppence
	Treacle was quite a beauty. I should imagine the Faerie Queen must be exquisite.
Tuppence
	Imagine how envious people would be if one married a faerie. Yes, what an idea! A faerie bride...
%0%a001240
	I reckon I know all the paths through here now.
	How about you, Dad?
%0%a001240
	It's okay. I know we have to keep the thing with the gold bauble a secret from the faeries.
%0%a001240
	They've all been such a big help to us. We'd better make sure we do our best.
%0%a001250
	Do you think that I'll still be able to see faeries when I grow up if I make sure I behave myself and I'm good all the time?
Sancho
	Eef ees possible to turn back time, ees...
Sancho
	No. Ees no important.
	Come. We go, okay?
Bianca
	This is a pretty dense forest, eh? You can hardly see the sky at all.
Bianca
	Ouch! I've got a crick in my neck from lookin' up
	so much!
Nera
	The air smells so fresh inside a forest. I wonder how far this one stretches on for.
Nera
	So only the children could see the faerie the first time you were here? How interesting!
%0%a001240
	Over by the bonfire, Dad!
	We should go and have a look.
%0%a001250
	I saw her! I just saw a faerie over there by the bonfire! Can we go and talk to her?
Sancho
	Ees esome kind of game?
	Sí. I remember you like to play like thees when you are young, friend.
Tuppence
	Yes, I, er, I saw it too! Over by the bonfire...
	Er, it was a huge bearded man!
Tuppence
	Yes, with six legs...and, er, four ears... Um, no, maybe it was two legs... Anyway, there's something there!
Sancho
	Eh!? Ees no one there, but...
	You no hear a voice?
Sancho
	My Majesty! Run! Run away before you
	are keelled!
Tuppence
	Hm? Did I hear a voice then, or am I just
	imagining things?
%0%a001240
	Did you see her that time, Dad?
	She made it so adults can see her too.
%0%a001250
	Are we going to Faerie Lea again?
	I love it there!
Tuppence
	You can see her, can't you, %a000090? It doesn't make sense! Why can't I? It's not fair!
Bianca
	You had a little bit of an adventure with a faerie when you were a kid, din't you?
Bianca
	You've certainly got your fair share of tales to
	tell, eh?
Nera
	I saw her too! I saw the faerie! She looks just like the faeries I saw all those years ago.
Debora
	This forest is deeper than it looks.
	What are we doing here, anyway?
Debora
	I had no idea a place like this existed so close to home.
Debora
	So that's a faerie. She looked a bit odd, but quite cute in a way.
