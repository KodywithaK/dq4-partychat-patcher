Bianca
	Pretty lucky that that performance of mine got us a free night's lodgin', eh?
Bianca
	Ha ha! Only jokin'. I'm ready to go now, so we'd better say thanks to the innkeeper.
Nera
	It's probably the thin air up here that made me feel faint yesterday.
Nera
	They had a stretcher here, after all, so
	I'm probably not the first visitor to fall
	foul of the climate.
Bianca
	They carried me here on a stretcher, right?
	Huh. I'd have much rathered you carried me, %a000090!
Nera
	That man helped carry me inside, didn't he?
Nera
	I feel so embarrassed. The thought of imposing on total strangers like that!
Bianca
	I may have collapsed when we got here, but I feel better than ever now. I won't be doin' that again!
Nera
	I wonder if that woman moved here from the town below. That would just go to prove that love conquers all.
Bianca
	This village is certainly in a precarious old place, eh? It feels like it's about to go rollin' off down the mountain any minute!
Bianca
	The villagers seem to steer well clear of
	the edges, eh? We should stick to the inner
	paths too.
Nera
	The air up here is so fresh, and the view is incredible. I just wish I had the courage to
	look at it!
Nera
	It's scary that there are no fences anywhere.
	I wonder if any of the villagers ever fall over the edge...
Bianca
	There've bin monsters about for as long as I can remember. It's hard to imagine a time when there weren't any.
Nera
	Even if there weren't any monsters around, it would take a certain determined type of person to make his way all the way up here.
Bianca
	So that's Gotha. It's hard to tell from up here whether it's far away or not.
Nera
	So the castle inside those walls is Gotha Castle.
Bianca
	Ha ha! He must have a scary old grandma to be gettin' that wound up!
Nera
	Hm? Did you say something?
Nera
	Sorry. I was concentrating on trying to
	get across that bridge without panicking
	about the height.
Bianca
	I love cats. I could stand here watchin' that one all day!
Nera
	I don't understand why so many people choose between being a ⓗcat personⓘ and a ⓗdog personⓘ.
	I adore them both.
Bianca
	If you change how you prepare somethin', folk'll often eat things they swear they dun't like.
Nera
	She's obviously trying her hardest to get her son to eat well. You have to admire her for that.
Bianca
	There's lots of foods you dun't like, en't there, %a000090?
Bianca
	Ha ha! You en't changed a bit since you were a little lad!
Bianca
	You've changed then! I remember you leavin' lots of food when you came to stay at our house all them years ago.
Nera
	It must be a terrible bind bringing food all the way up here. No wonder she's angry about him leaving things.
Bianca
	I feel all embarrassed when people say things like that!
Nera
	Why do you look so troubled, darling?
Nera
	I'm really glad I married you and I don't
	regret it one bit. We'll always be happy
	together, you and I.
Bianca
	Sorry you got told off! I'm sure she meant well.
Nera
	I'm so sorry, darling. It's my fault that I fainted, so she shouldn't have scolded you like that.
Nera
	She didn't mean anything by it, I'm sure. She may have been a bit blunt, but her heart was in the right place.
Bianca
	Little does he know that Pankraz will never be returnin' home now...
Nera
	If both the King and Queen of Gotha are missing, I wonder who's ruling the kingdom.
Bianca
	One year!? That Batten binnacle had best be worth waitin' for then!
Nera
	Papa collected all sorts of things on his
	travels, but I don't remember him ever
	having one of those compasses.
Bianca
	It shouldn't take one year even if they are handmade. I reckon whoever's makin' them must be takin' a few too many breaks!
Nera
	We're so lucky, receiving such a sought
	after item for nothing. That old lady
	really was generous.
Bianca
	Your mother's full name was Madalena, wasn't it, %a000090? I dun't reckon that's just a coincidence neither.
Bianca
	I always feel calm and at peace when you look at me, %a000090.
Nera
	I've always felt relaxed around you, %a000090. I realise now that it's because of the way you look at me.
Nera
	If only I had that skill myself. Then I could look at you and make you feel nice and calm too.
Debora
	So I was carried here on a stretcher?
	What a shame I don't remember!
	It was my first time.
Debora
	I don't suppose...
	You wouldn't carry me around on a stretcher for the rest of our trip, would you?
Debora
	He helped carry me inside, didn't he? You'd better make sure you thank all these people on my behalf, %a000090.
Debora
	I caused a bit of a fuss collapsing like that.
	I'd planned that you'd be attending to me, not half the village!
Debora
	Snow all year round? That's no good. I'd never have the chance to wear a skirt and high heels.
Debora
	It could be dangerous if you ended up getting a bit tipsy here.
Debora
	It'd be far too easy to go tumbling off the edge if you didn't have your wits about you.
Debora
	That old man has no idea!
Debora
	Even if there weren't any monsters, this isn't exactly the easiest place in the world to reach.
Debora
	So that's Gotha. It's a lot more impressive than I expected. It's still out in the sticks, though.
Debora
	Grr. Of all the irritating things!
Debora
	What do you mean, ⓗwhatⓘ!? The stupid bridge, of course! Why build something so flimsy so high up?
	It's just ridiculous!
Debora
	I wonder if that cat wants to come along with us...
	What? ⓗNot likelyⓘ? You don't have a clue, do you?
Debora
	Ah yes, the tedious art of cooking...
	What kind of gourmet meals are you going to make for me, %a000090?
Debora
	What's up? Are you a bit on the fussy side too? Hmm, I'll bear that in mind.
Debora
	Well... I wouldn't have married you if I didn't think you'd take care of me.
Debora
	Absolutely. She's quite right.
Debora
	You're very lucky to have married so far above your station. You should take better care of me. That's an order.
Debora
	This is really starting to get on my nerves now!
	Why does Gotha have to be stuck out in the back end of nowhere?
Debora
	It's a good job that we're not in too much of a hurry. There's clearly no quick way to get there.
Debora
	One year!? They certainly take their time making those, don't they? I'd get fed up with waiting.
Debora
	Ooh, this is quite a precious thing to have.
	Maybe we should take a walk around the village and show it off to make people jealous!
Debora
	Look deeeep into my eyes...
	Come on, don't be shy!
	Why won't you look at me?
