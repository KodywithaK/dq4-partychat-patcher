*: 
	Welcome to the armour shop.
	How can I serve you?
*: 
	What would you like to buy?
*: 
	Sorry, but you don't seem to have enough money with you.
*: 
	%0%a040100?
	Very well.
*: 
	%H0840%X%0%a020100%Y%a000840 %a010100%Z?
	Thank you very much.
*: 
	You might want to try using %H0840%X%M0100%Xthem%Yit%Z%Yone of them%Z as an item during battle!
*: 
	Who's going to carry the goods?
*: 
	I'll put the goods in your bag for you, then.
*: 
	You can't carry any more, %a000180.
	Would you like me to reorganise your items?
*: 
	All done. I've sorted things out for you.
*: 
	Unfortunately, you have a lot of important items, %a000180. I can't mess with them.
*: 
	Can someone else carry the goods?
*: 
	Would you like to equip %M0100%Xthem%Yit%Z right away?
*: 
	Ah, yes! This'll be just the ticket!
~ %0%a000180 equips %a020100! ~
*: 
	You can't equip this particular item, %a000180. Do you still want it?
*: 
	Here you are, %a000180!
*: 
	I'll just place the goods in %a000180's coffin.
*: 
	Okay. I'll make sure the goods get to %a000180 in the wagon, then.
*: 
	I'll put the remaining item%H0880%X%Ys%Z in your bag, then.
*: 
	Can I help you with anything else?
*: 
	Who has something to sell?
*: 
	Excuse me? But you aren't carrying anything, %a000180!
*: 
	Erm, I'm afraid your bag appears to be empty.
*: 
	I'm sorry, but I don't deal in that kind of item.
*: 
	You should take good care of it.
	I imagine it's rather valuable.
*: 
	If you sell %H0840%X%M0100%Xthose%Ythat%Z%Ythose%Z, you might never be able to get %H0840%X%M0100%Xthem%Yit%Z%Ythem%Z back. Are you sure you want to do this?
*: 
	I'll take %M0100%Xthose%Ythat%Z %a000100 off your hands for %a000620 gold coin%H0620%X%Ys%Z. Okay?
*: 
	How many do you wish to sell?
*: 
	So, you wish to sell me %a000840 %a010100? I'll give you %a000620 gold coin%H0620%X%Ys%Z for them. Is that alright?
*: 
	That's a shame...
*: 
	I'm ever so sorry. I'd love to make a purchase from you, but you appear to have as much gold as you can carry.
*: 
	Why don't you buy something from me first?
*: 
	It's always a pleasure doing business with you.
*: 
	Would you like to sell anything else?
*: 
	Is there anything else I can help you with?
*: 
	Come again any time!
