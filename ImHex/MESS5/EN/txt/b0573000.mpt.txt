	Blimey! I dun't think I've ever seen a T 'n' T board
	so big.
Bianca
	I think we'd better pass on this one. Imagine how long it'd take to reach the goal!
Nera
	I didn't expect to find such a splendid T 'n' T
	board here.
Nera
	Goodness! It would take days to reach the goal in this place.

	What a ginormous T 'n' T Board! I'm so excited!
%0%a001240
	I wonder how many times you'd have to roll the dice to get to the goal here. Fifty? A hundred?
%0%a001250
	Hmm... I'm trying to plot a good route through it all, but it's just too complicated!
%0%a001250
	I think I'd rather sit this one out and watch you play, Dad.
Sancho
	Ees a fine T 'n' T board, sí?
Sancho
	Ees no the place for your Uncle Sancho, though.
	You no need me here.
Tuppence
	My lucky fingers are just itching to get hold of the dice here, %a000090!
Tuppence
	Just leave everything to me! ...No, I wish I could be that confident, but confidence always seems to be something I'm rather short on.
Bianca
	Oh! He looks so sad. Still, if you've made up
	your mind...
Nera
	Poor thing! He looks so disappointed. I didn't think he'd be so hurt.
%0%a001250
	I don't mind him coming along. I'll look after him.
	Can he really not come, Dad?
Sancho
	Sí, he ees a monster, but he ees estill just a bebé.
	Ees eso esad to esee heem looking upset like that. I, I... (sob)
Bianca
	Another funny friend to add to our numbers, eh?

	If Starkers is Estark's son, then he'll probably end up being really strong.
Tuppence
	Hmph. Another monster. This is becoming quite embarrassing.
Nera
	Oh dear! Have we got too many monsters with us, do you think?
%0%a001250
	Maybe we need to wave goodbye to one of the monsters we already have before we can let Starkers join us.
%0%a001250
	Hmm... That's a tricky one.
Debora
	This is certainly a fair-sized T 'n' T board.
	You'll have to have a go.
Debora
	Maybe I'll speak to Papa next time we see him and get him to build me an even bigger T 'n' T board than this!
Debora
	I don't recall turning you into such a cold character. Invite him to join us!
Debora
	He's really quite sweet. I feel like I want to mother him. ...Ha! Only joking!
Debora
	That's a shame. I was looking forward to taking care of that little thing.
