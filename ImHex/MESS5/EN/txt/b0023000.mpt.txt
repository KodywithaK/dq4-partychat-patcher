Honey
	I know it's you %a000090.
	You can't fool me!
Honey
	Wow. It's been ages, hasn't it?
Honey
	If you want to know how to find Queen Caramel, you should speak to Sherbet downstairs in the library.

Honey
	Play a trick on %a000090 for me when you see him, okay? Tee hee hee hee!
Honey
	Neverglade and the Faerie Palace are the two places where the faerie world and the human world meet.
Honey
	But even faeries can't just go into the Faerie Palace whenever they like. Queen Caramel has to give you permission first.
Honey
	Otherwise I'd really like to go too.
	But I can't. Tee hee.
Sherbet
	Welcome to Faerie Lea's library. I'm Sherbet. Do I understand you're looking for the Faerie Palace?
Sherbet
	Well, the Faerie Palace is normally invisible to humans.
Sherbet
	But if you blow the faerie horn when you're near it, you should be able to see it too.
Sherbet
	You must find a lake in the middle of a dense forest surrounded by mountains. That's where you need to blow the horn.
*: 
	We're all praying for Zenithia to climb back up into the sky, and for peace to rain down on the world.
Sherbet
	Welcome to Faerie Lea's library.
	Oh, do you have a question for me?
Sherbet
	I see, you need a faerie quill, do you?
Sherbet
	Well, alright, then. I'm sure I can rely on you to use it wisely.
Sherbet
	Here you are. One faerie quill for you!
~ %0%a000120 receives a faerie quill! ~
~ %0%a000180 takes the faerie quill. ~
Sherbet
	Anything you write with a faerie quill will vanish as soon as you take it out of the Realm of the Faeries.
Sherbet
	Except if you use a special ink made from an eyevory tusk-tusk. Then you'll be able to see it wherever you are.

	Treacle said you would be coming.
*: 
	I am Queen Caramel. You wish to know about the two orbs in Zenithia? Yes, we faeries crafted them.
Queen Caramel
	But that was then. We don't have that power
	any more.
Queen Caramel
	Look...
~ Queen Caramel produces a gold bauble. ~
Queen Caramel
	You see, we've already tried to make an orb.
Queen Caramel
	I know it looks like an orb, but this bauble doesn't have the power to hold Zenithia in the heavens.
Queen Caramel
	But you, %a000090... Maybe you do.
Queen Caramel
	So I'm giving you this gold bauble.
~ %0%a000120 receives the gold bauble. ~
~ %0%a000180 takes it. ~
Queen Caramel
	Now, go up the stairs at the back! And hurry!
	The faerie there will tell you what to do.
Queen Caramel
	We faeries don't have the power to alter the passage of time.
Queen Caramel
	But you, %a000090, may be able to. You may have the power to change the course of history.
Queen Caramel
	Now, go up the stairs at the back! And hurry!

Queen Caramel
	We faeries don't have the power to alter the passage of time.
Queen Caramel

	You must have that power.
Queen Caramel
	Go now. The time has come.
	Return the gold orb to its rightful place.
*: 
	I'm writing a complete history of the entire world.
*: 
	It's a very valuable record, you know.
	That's why I'm using the ink of an eyevory
	tusk-tusk. It never fades, you see.
*: 
	Hm? A pen and ink whose writing doesn't fade for years and years, you say?
*: 
	Well, obviously you're referring to the ink of the eyevory tusk-tusk. Yes, you should visit the church known as Northminster for that.
*: 
	As for a pen, you can't beat a faerie quill. As
	far as I'm aware, they're still being made in Faerie Lea's library.
*: 
	I'm afraid I can't give you mine, because I only have the one set left.
*: 
	These are faerie treasures.
	Everyone loves treasures, don't they?
*: 
	But boo hoo. They won't bring about peace.
	You can have them if you want. Tee hee!
*: 
	May the Goddess blow candy kisses down on you and your party.
*: 
	This is a special picture. It shows what's in the heart of whoever looks at it.
*: 
	You must bring the gold bauble that Queen Caramel made for you. And it must be in %O0960%Xyour own hands, %a000090%Y%a000090's hands%Z.
*: 
	This is a special picture. It shows what's in the heart of whoever looks at it.

*: 
	If you stand in front of it and open your heart, %a000090, I'm sure you'll meet someone dear to you.

	I know something you don't!
	I know something you don't!
	But okay, I'll tell you. Tee hee hee!
*: 
	The picture in the upstairs room on the east side of the palace gets changed every now and then.
*: 
	But it's only just been changed for a picture to celebrate the birth of the legendary hero, so it probably won't be changed again for a while.
*: 
	Ssshhh!
	Don't say anything!
*: 
	I'm not really a cat. I'm a magician.
	I'm studying the faeries here.

~ It's a picture illustrating the tale of the legendary hero's birth. ~

	Hm? Haven't seen you around these parts before. Our village chief, Pankraz, is ever so strong, I'll have you know!
*: 
	I wouldn't go causin' any trouble if you know what's good for you.
*: 
	My poor plants are really sufferin' here with this cold. I'm at my wits' end, I am.
*: 
	Brrrrr. I'm f-f-f-f-freezing! It's supposed to be s-s-summer before long. I don't g-g-get why it's

	This here's Whealbrook. We only ever get nice and friendly folk visitin' our village.

	The village chief, Pankraz, came home from his travels just the other day. He was away for two years, you know.
*: 
	It must've been a tirin' journey for him, travellin' about all that time with a young lad in tow.
*: 
	There's nobody here and yet I feel like
	I can sense someone.
*: 
	Pankraz's boy was just standin' there chattin' away to himself as if someone was right in front of him too.
*: 
	It's all very odd.
*: 
	I had a few drinks with a chap called Pankraz in the pub last night.
*: 
	He really made an impression on me. So much hardship, and yet so much strength in the face of it. He's no ordinary man!
*: 
	Dear me! I turn my head for a second, and come back to find the pot practically licked clean!
*: 
	The old man should just speak up
	if he's that hungry.
*: 
	I didn't eat it, I tell you!
*: 
	Honestly! That old dragon of a wife of mine treats me like a child sometimes!
*: 
	That Pankraz! He spends two years away travelling, and then he's straight off again to Roundbeck just like that!
*: 
	He's certainly a busy man, that much is for sure.
*: 
	I'm not sure if this is true or not, but people say Pankraz's wife was snatched away by monsters.
*: 
	I pity poor %a000090. A boy that small needs his mother around.
*: 
	Ooh, what a splendid-lookin' fella!
*: 
	Oh dear! Listen to me, sayin' things like that!
*: 
	We don't have much to offer here in Whealbrook, but you just make yourself at home and enjoy your stay, lad.
Mr Rockefeller
	Pankraz has been summoned to Coburg Castle.
Mr Rockefeller
	I'm not sure why, but I can't help havin' a bad feeling about this somehow.
Sancho
	Hola? Have we met before, señor?
Sancho
	Ah! You are one of señor Pankraz's amigos, sí?
Sancho
	Eef you are looking for heem, he ees upstairs now.
Pankraz
	Hm? Do I know you? Is there something you're wanting to discuss?
Pankraz
	What did you say!? You're my son!?
Pankraz
	Ha ha ha hah! I only have one son, and that's my boy %a000090!
Pankraz
	Was there something else?
Pankraz
	Hmm... I shouldn't go to Coburg, you say?
Pankraz
	Well, you've certainly done your homework to know I've been summoned there, at any rate.
Pankraz
	Oh, I see! You're some kind of prophet, are you?
Pankraz
	Sorry, but I don't believe in that sort of thing.
Pankraz
	Your eyes really remind me of my wife's eyes, you know. ...I suppose it wouldn't hurt for me to at least bear your advice in mind.
Pankraz
	Well, if that's all... I'm rather busy at the moment, so if you could excuse me...
Pankraz
	I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about.
Pankraz
	Never mind, anyway. I'm busy.
	Perhaps you'll excuse me.
Pankraz
	Then maybe you could stop disturbing me from my work. I'm in the middle of investigating something.
Dr Agon
	Well if that doesn't put the 'whili' in 'gee whilikers'! You've found me an orb!
~ %0%a000120 hands the gold bauble to Dr Agon. ~

	I'll just pop it up here on the pedestal, and...
Dr Agon
	That should do-diddly-ooh-diddly it!
Dr Agon
	............
Dr Agon
	I wonder what the problem is. It doesn't look like this orb has what it takes to put us back in orb-it!
Dr Agon
	It's no darn-diddly use to me.
	You'd better take it back...
~ %0%a000120 receives the gold bauble. ~
Dr Agon
	I don't know what happened exactly, but I think you'd better take a trip back to the Faerie Palace.

Dr Agon
	Take a good look, %H0860%Xfriend%Yfriends%Z!
Dr Agon
	Well, that didn't get us up quite as ⓗon highⓘ as I was expecting.
Dr Agon
	But you know what they say: grumbling's a grievance of the devil! Mind if I leave things
	up to you for a while?
Dr Agon
	Now the water's drained away, I'm off to do a tour of the castle and make sure everything's okely-dokely-doo!
Dr Agon
	See you later, prestidigitator!
Dr Agon
	By the grace of the Goddess, many of my fellow Zenithians survived the flooding.
Dr Agon
	You can't beat a bit of clock-stopping hibernation to get you out of a drop of the old hot water!
Dr Agon
	I'm so happy to see my old friends, I've counted way past seventh heaven...I'm on cloud nine!
*:

*: 
	Lo, if thou wouldst have us descend, thou canst do so at the touch of a button: the A Button, the B Button or the X Button.
*: 
	But have a care! The terrain must be flat %H0860%Xshouldst thou%Yshould you%Z wish Zenithia to descend. %H0860%XThou%YYou%Z must find plains or desert or some such similar surface.
*: 
	Long have we awaited this day.
*: 
	Prithee, hasten and tell the old man in the rearward chamber the glad tidings!
*: 
	Behold! My sapling of the Great World Tree, Yggdrasil, still lives!
*: 
	Zenithia is saved, thanks be to %H0860%Xthy good self%Yyour good selves%Z.
	Pray, take this as a gift.

*: 
	Forsooth, the Great World Tree, Yggdrasil, belongeth on the ground below.
*: 
	But the power of Nimzo doth grow more briskly than we feared. The darkness spreadeth apace.
*: 
	I believe it wise to nurture Her in this pot for
	the nonce.
*: 
	Tee hee hee!
	Thank you!
*: 
	This is a present for you. Help yourself to some  Yggdrasil dew!
*: 
	You can't have more than one drop of Yggdrasil dew at a time. That would be naughty! Tee hee!
*: 
	But it heals everyone at once. And you can come back for more after you've used it too.
*: 
	What!? Zenithia's taken to the skies again?
	That's wonderful news!
*: 
	Now we just need to bring about the resurrection of the Zenith Dragon, and everything will be back on track.
*: 
	The powers of the Zenith Dragon are said to be sealed in a place called Talon Tower, on an island to the west of Helmunaptra.
*: 
	You can have what's in that chest of drawers over there to take with you. It might come in
	useful, you know.
*: 
	When peace still reigned over the world, the Zenith Dragon did look down over His earthly dominion and speak to us thus...
*: 
	ⓗHumans are a noble breed.ⓘ
*: 
	And with these words, He did vanish and conceal Himself.
*: 
	Alack! Who would have foretold the demise of Zenithia centuries later? That it should crash so to the ground?
*: 
	Were it not for such a tristful pass ⓚⓛ had
	Zenithia remained aloft ⓚⓛ the world might
	still now know peace.
