	There are three types of slot machine. There are single-token, ten-token and hundred-token machines.
*: 
	Always best to start off with the single-token machines, if you want my advice.
*: 
	This is the casino's one hundred token
	mega-attraction!
*: 
	And just when I was doing so well! I won loads of tokens, but then I decided to play the hundred-token machine...
*: 
	I can't wait to be among the performers who get a changing room to use.

	When ya get to my age, them's the kinda things that keep y'alive. Ha ha ha ha.

	Have ya heard about the legendary hero?
	Everyone's speculatin' about whether he's

*: 
	I've got a thousand G down that says he does!

	These dancers aren't bad.

	Sorry, I don't do autographs.
	
Rometta
	You saw the performance, did you?
	Thanks. I hope you liked it.
Tylbert
	Maybe it's because we travel around so much,
	but I get the feeling things are getting more and
	more unstable.
Tylbert
	Take that castle up north of here. It's been completely ravaged by monsters.
	You should be careful, you know.
Carla
	Wow! What a hero, getting, like, sooo many monsters to join you. You're way cool!
Carla
	But with that many monsters already part of your team, you're gonna find it hard to recruit any others.
Carla
	If you wanna, like, get some other monsters to join the party, you better say bye to some of these guys, huh?
Carla
	Zzz... Zzz...
	Like, zzz...

*: 
	This is Whealbrook. If you head west from here, you end up in Roundbeck.
*: 
	Hello there. Do I know you?
*: 
	Hello there. Do I know you?
*: 
	Of course! You're Pankraz's son, %a000090!
*: 
	Well, well! You've certainly grown into a fine young lad.
*: 
	So, tell me. How's your father doin'?
~ %0%a000090 explains everything that's happened. ~
*: 
	Oh no. Of all the things! What a terrible time of it you've had.
*: 
	You can see for yourself that the times have been cruel for our little village too.
*: 
	But all that pales into insignificance when I think of poor old Pankraz.
*: 
	Come to think of it, I seem to remember him hidin' somethin' precious in the cave all those years ago.
*: 
	Who knows what's become of it now?
*: 
	Maybe it's still in there after all these years! You should go and have a look. Be careful, mind.
*: 
	This used to be a beautiful village back in the day.
*: 
	But then those soldiers came from Coburg and burnt the place to the ground.
*: 
	It's unforgivable! Unforgivable, I tell you! It's all Pankraz's fault, that poor prince goin' missin'!
*: 
	Er, forgive me. I seem to have got a bit carried away.
*: 
	You must be wonderin' what in the world I'm on about, not knowin' Pankraz and all.
*: 
	Oh! You do know him, you say? He's your father!? Goodness gracious me!
*: 
	I'm just tryin' to think what the name of that young boy was... %0%a000090! That's it.
	Are you really %a000090?
*: 
	Who'd have thought it!? Good heavens! Goddess, give me strength!
*: 
	You young rascal! Fancy lyin' to a lady of the church!
*: 
	I can't help feelin' like I've met you somewhere before, mind. Maybe I'm just imaginin' it.
*: 
	Oh dear. What an awful thing to happen.
	Poor Pankraz...
*: 
	So now you're plannin' on takin' his place and searchin' for your mother, are you, %a000090?
*: 
	Dear Goddess! Please guide this child with your protective light!
*: 
	Don't be mean to me! I've boing living in Whealbrook a long time. I used to live in the cave.
*: 
	I know about those goons setting the village on fire. They were funny-looking soldiers. (Slurp)
*: 
	And I know about Pankraz having a place of gooreat importance to him in the cave.
*: 
	You just have to ride a raft deep inside and you'll come to it eventually. It's very hard to ooze your way!
*: 
	This inn of ours used to be a lot nicer back in the day, until those soldiers wrecked the place.
*: 
	It's a bit humble I'm afraid, but I hope you'll at least find it comfortable enough to rest your weary head for the night.
*: 
	Ah-phew, ah-phew.
*: 
	Zzzz... Who are you? ...Honey? That's a weird name. Zzzz...
*: 
	Hello there. Do I know you?
*: 
	Hello there. Do I know you?
*: 
	Of course! You're Pankraz's son, %a000090!

*: 
	This poor lad lost his parents and was all alone, so I decided to take him in.
*: 
	You were about his age when you lived here all those years ago.
*: 
	I'm just makin' the beds at the moment.
	You have a good rest, won't you?
*: 
	This inn of ours used to be a lot nicer back in the day, until those soldiers wrecked the place.
*: 
	It's a bit humble I'm afraid, but I hope you'll at least find it comfortable enough to rest your weary head for the night.
*: 
	There's nothin' of any value here any more, but we used to have people comin' in search of the famous Whealbrook bluestones.
*: 
	Maybe you can still find them somewhere, hidden in big rocks in the cave or somethin'.
*: 
	Anythin's possible. There are rocks in there big enough to trap people underneath them, y'know.
	㈡
	*: Somethin' that big could easily be hidin' a gem.

*: 
	I hear somethin' called the Zenithian Sword was found right here in our cave!
*: 
	Apparently, it can only be used by some kind of legendary hero. It's all very mysterious!
*: 
	That must've been the sword Pankraz was scratchin' his head about all those years back, wonderin' why he couldn't fight with it.
*: 
	I'd never seen him look that troubled before.
*: 
	Good heavens! You're goin' off in search of the legendary hero!? Are you sure that's wise?
*: 
	Actually, I seem to remember hearin' some talk about the legendary hero over in Roundbeck long ago.
*: 
	That's where that old friend of yours, Bianca, lived. I wonder how she's doin' now.
*: 
	I knew you were jokin'. If he's part of legend already, then he's probably already dead, after all.

*: 
	Welcome to Roundbeck!
*: 
	A traveller, are you? I used to do a bit of travellin' myself in the past, goin' over Coburg way an' sellin' weapons.
*: 
	You wouldn't catch me over there again for love nor money, though. Nope, never again!
Prince Harry
	............
*: 
	What a sorry old state of affairs!
*: 
	I heard about that brat of a prince disappearin' and his brother becomin' king, so I went over to Coburg to sign up.
*: 
	But it's actually the kid's mother, the Queen Dowager, who's pullin' all the strings! That place is on the road to ruin, you mark my words!
Prince Harry
	............
*: 
	This fella run away from Coburg, y'know.
*: 
	I'd heard a few rumours, but I had no idea the place had got so bad.
*: 
	I'm travelling the world in search of legendary weapons.
*: 
	I came to Roundbeck because I heard there was a man living here who knows a thing or two about legends.
*: 
	I'm a travelling nun. I can sense certain things, you know.
*: 
	And right now I'm sensing that the seal placed by the Goddess to close off the dark world is gradually weakening.
*: 
	If that seal were to break, the world would once again be plunged into utter darkness. Brrr!
*: 
	I'm an old friend of Whitey who used to run the inn. I came back after all these years to pay him a visit.
*: 
	But I'm told he had problems with his health so he sold up and moved to a village in the mountains far across the sea from here.
*: 
	I was hoping to see that daughter of his again. What a shame!
*: 
	You're on a journey in search of someone,
	you say?
*: 
	That reminds me of a king who was travellin' the world lookin' for his queen long, long ago.
*: 
	I never did hear of him findin' her, so maybe he's still searchin' to this day.
	Aah, how romantic!
*: 
	My son went off to work in Coburg, but he's back home again now.
*: 
	He was full of all sorts of big ideas about makin' his fortune and the like. So much for that!
*: 
	Still, I must admit it's a relief to have him back. That's the thing with bein' a parent.
*: 
	Bianca, you say? No, I'm afraid I dun't know anyone of that name.
*: 
	My old man and I bought this place from a man called Whitaker...ooh, seven years back now, it was.
*: 
	Why dun't you stay the night? We've got a special offer on at the moment where you get a souvenir if you stay two nights or more!
*: 
	Make sure you come and see me after two nights stayin' here, won't you?
*: 
	Hm? You've stayed two nights already?
	What a good customer you are!
*: 
	Then I must give you one of our famous grape-scented Roundbeck Zizzwizz Pillows!

*: 
	Ooh! Hello there, young man!
	Would you like a drink?
*: 
	Here you are. Enjoy!
*: 
	Then what can I do for you?
	The legendary hero, eh? Just a sec!
*: 
	It's my dad who knows all about that.
	Why don't you go on in and pick his brains?
*: 
	My dad knows a thing or two about the legendary hero. Ask him as much as you like.
*: 
	You want to know about the legendary hero, do you? Then you've come to the right place!
*: 
	Long, long ago, the Lord of the Underworld, Es...something or other, was resurrected, and set about destroying the world.
*: 
	But then the legendary hero, with the Zenithian Equipment on his side, defeated him and saved us all.
*: 
	He had four items altogether: the Zenithian Sword, the Zenithian Armour, the Zenithian Shield and the Zenithian Helm.
*: 
	Hm? What happened to him after that?
*: 
	Some say he returned to Zenithia up in the sky, but I don't know if that's what really happened or not.
*: 
	It was all a long time ago, anyway, so I very much doubt he'd still be alive now.
*: 
	I s'pose you might be able to find one of his descendants somewhere if you were lucky.
*: 
	Evening! Welcome to Roundbeck!
*: 
	Coburg used to be a nice place back in old King James's day.
*: 
	But it all got turned on its head when he died and Prince Wilbur took the throne.
*: 
	I heard a tale once about a clan of people who guard the seal to the dark world, Nadiria.
*: 
	It's said that these people have some means of communicatin' with the monster folk.
*: 
	I was still thinkin' of him as my little boy, but he's suddenly got so big!
*: 
	Still, he'll always be my baby!
*: 
	Goo! Goo!
*: 
	Ah-phew, ah-phew...
*: 
	Right, well, I'm all washed now so it's time for beddy-byes!
*: 
	Who knows what joyous things tomorrow may bring?
~ %0%a000090 stirs suddenly. ~
~ Harry seems to be deep in thought. ~
Harry
	Are you awake, %a000090?
	I was just thinking about home.
Harry
	It was quite a shock to hear from the townsfolk about Father passing away.
Harry
	It sounds like Wilbur has taken over the throne, but people don't seem all that impressed with him.
Harry
	I'm wondering if maybe I should go back for a quick visit.
Harry
	You know, just to see what's what. Coburg isn't too far from here, just off to the east.
Harry
	Still, we can talk about that in the morning.
	Time for some shut-eye, eh?
*: 
	Ooh! Hello there, young man!
	Would you like a drink?
*: 
	Here you are. Enjoy!
*: 
	Then what can I do for you?
	The legendary hero, eh? Just a sec!

*: 
	I s'pose you might be able to find one of his descendants somewhere if you were lucky.
*: 
	It's my dream to get hold of a legendary weapon and become the strongest warrior in the world!
*: 
	I wonder where it is old Whitey and his family moved on to.
*: 
	I was hoping to see that daughter of his again. What a shame!
*: 
	Do us a favour!
	Just pretend you ain't seen us, will ya?
*: 
	Eh? You ain't here to come after us?
	Well, thank the Goddess for that then, eh!
*: 
	I'm Dave and this is Vicky. The fing is, we're in love. But our families don't agree wiv it. Say we're not of the same class or somefin'.
Vicky
	Yes. And yet we couldn't bear to part ways,
	so we ran away togever.
Dave
	We even thought about doin' ourselves in, like. But then we found this place and thought it wouldn't be a bad pad. We're 'appy as Larry now!
Vicky
	It's really quite bizarre, you know.
Vicky
	When we first arrived here, it was almost like the castle wanted us to stay. Like it was welcoming us somehow.
Vicky
	I can't believe we ever thought about ending it all. We couldn't be happier now.

	This place is so quiet and relaxing. Aah!
	Anyhow...
*: 
	This is Littlehaven. Come here to catch a boat, have ya? I'm afraid you're in for a long wait.
*: 
	Orders from the King of Coburg, see. The harbour's only allowed to be used by royal command from now on.
*: 
	So we ain't got no boats comin' in to dock here no more.
*: 
	Honestly! What is the world coming to?
	The situation in Coburg is a disgrace.
