	Have you seen what happens if you stretch your hand out in front of you? It disappears!
%0%a001240
	Ha ha! It's fun walking around in the mist like this.
%0%a001250
	Ooh, this is really weird. Is it some kind of mist?
	I can't see a thing!
%0%a001250
	It feels weird walking around in the mist. Just think, a faerie could jump out at us at any moment!
Sancho
	Ees cold here. You put on more clothes, okay?
Tuppence
	It's so mysterious, so exquisite...
	But where in the Goddess' name are we?
Tuppence
	Now! Now's my chance! The mist will mask my attack, and the kingdom will be mine!
	No one will know it wasⓚⓛ
Tuppence
	Oh! What?
	Ha ha hah! No, no. I was just... Nothing!
%0%a001240
	Hang on a minute! Maybe this is the place we were looking for, Dad.
%0%a001240
	This mist is pretty incredible. I can hardly see you there, Dad!
%0%a001250
	Hmm... I feel like someone's calling out to us.
%0%a001250
	It's all so beautiful and white! So this is what it feels like to be in the mist.
Sancho
	I no like places eef they are too pretty.
	They make me eso, eso emotional.
	Ees, ees too much for me. I, I... (sob)
Tuppence
	Now! Now's my chance! The mist will mask my attack, and the kingdom will be mine!
	No one will know it wasⓚⓛ
Tuppence
	Oh! What?
	Ha ha hah! No, no. I was just... Nothing!
%0%a001240
	The mist's lifted! I had a feeling this was where
	we were.
%0%a001250
	Isn't that the Faerie Palace?
	Come on, Dad! Let's hurry inside!
Sancho
	Olé! Thees horn, eet really works, eh?
Tuppence
	What a delightful tone. I feel as if my unworthy heart has been washed as clean as a whistle!
%0%a001240
	A palace in the middle of a lake...
	Does that mean faeries never get seasick?
%0%a001250
	I really want to meet with the faeries again.
	Can we hurry on over to the palace?
Sancho
	Thees Faerie Queen, eshe ees the most important of all the faeries, sí? You no esay notheeng loco, okay, friend?
Tuppence
	So the Faerie Palace is hidden in the mist...
	Or maybe it's not there in the mist at all!?
Bianca
	This is a mist and a half, eh?
	You are there, en't you, %a000090?
Nera
	I feel like I might just melt away into the mist at any minute! Stay close, won't you, darling?
%0%a001240
	What a pretty lake. The surface is just like a mirror!
%0%a001250
	Look, Dad! It looks like the sky's right there in
	the lake!
Sancho
	Ees estrange here, no? Thees beauty, ees like
	ees no real. Your Uncle Sancho, he no trust eet.
Tuppence
	They don't need much of a defence if they can hide the whole palace in the mist. I suppose that's why it looks so unencumbered.
Bianca
	Who'd have thought there'd be a view like this hidden in the mist!? I'm a bit bowled over.
Nera
	I feel like I'm in some kind of dream. I can hardly believe something so beautiful really exists.
%0%a001240
	What a weird palace! It's all wobbly where we're walking, just like being in a dream.
%0%a001240
	Do you think this palace is really real? I mean, there wasn't anything there in that mist, was there?
%0%a001250
	Let's not rush too much, okay, Dad? I want to spend as long here in this palace as we possibly can!
%0%a001250
	It's so beautiful! When I have a room of my own,
	I want to make it just like this.
Sancho
	I no believe thees place, eet really exists!
	You no comprende what ees real, and what
	ees just your imagination.
Tuppence
	Do you suppose the Queen of the Faeries is single?
	I wonder...
Bianca
	This is just like bein' in a faerie tale, eh?
	It certainly dun't feel like it could be real.
Nera
	I feel like my whole body is suddenly lighter than usual, like I'm floating.
%0%a001240
	It's just like Sherbet told us!
Sancho
	Come here, friend. Look at your Uncle Sancho.
	Sí, sí... I just do thees...and thees...and...
	Okay!
Sancho
	Now you are ready for your meeting weeth
	the Faerie Queen. You look handsome like a
	proud matador!
Bianca
	She dun't mind spillin' the beans about people's private lives, eh? Still, it's not like it's a bad thing
	she told us.
%0%a001240
	Oh, I get it! I know what a descendant is.
%0%a001240
	It means Mum likes going down wells, right?
	No, maybe not...
%0%a001250
	I wonder when the descendants stopped having wings. It seems a shame to have lost them.
	They're so pretty.
Sancho
	Sí, sí. Señor Pankraz and you, friend, you both have a good eye. Sí, sí, sí.
Bianca
	So if I hadn't got together with you, I wouldn't have had to go through all this trauma...
Bianca
	Ha ha! I'm only pullin' your leg! I dun't mean it, really. Oh, come on, %a000090! Dun't look at me like that!
Nera
	So this was all the Goddess' plan...
	And yet I thought I chose to be with
	you out of my own will.
%0%a001240
	Then shouldn't that make %a001250 a legendary hero too? Oh, but she can't equip any of the special stuff...
%0%a001240
	Still, having her along has certainly helped us do things we wouldn't have managed otherwise.
%0%a001250
	If only I could have been a legendary hero too. Then I could've shared half of the burden with %a001240.
Tuppence
	If you produced the legendary hero by being with a Zenithian, I wonder what I'd produce if I got together with a faerie...
Tuppence
	Tee hee! This could be rather interesting.
%0%a001240
	I'm a bit nervous about meeting the Queen.
	My heart's beating like mad!
Sancho
	Okay, friend. You no let your Uncle Sancho down, okay? Ees time for you to meet the Queen.
%0%a001240
	There aren't many boys about in this place,
	are there? Don't you think they get a bit bored,
	all girls together?
Tuppence
	That reminds me of my days at the castle. I often used to stand guard at the entrance like that.
Bianca
	So only %a001240 gets these sweet, sugar-plum blessings? What about the rest of us, eh?
%0%a001240
	Lots of people talk about me being this special hero, but I feel pretty normal really.
%0%a001250
	%0%a001240's not really old enough to be a legend, and yet that's what everyone calls him.
Tuppence
	Then they must know I've been born too. I'm vassal to the father of the legendary hero, after all!
%0%a001240
	It looks like a gold orb to me. Are you sure there's no way of making it work?
%0%a001240
	Huh! How annoying, after coming all this way!
%0%a001250
	Um... I'm sure everything will work out.
	Yes, somehow... You mustn't worry, Dad.
Tuppence
	That Faerie Queen is quite a beauty,
	just as I imagined.
%0%a001240
	What did she mean about altering the passage of time? It's all far too complicated for me to follow.
%0%a001250
	Let's just walk around the palace lots, shall we?
	It's always good to walk about if you have something on your mind.
Tuppence
	I'd say it seems the lovely Faerie Queen is single, after all. Things are looking up!
%0%a001240
	Wow! You'd think it would make his hand ache too much, writing so much stuff!
%0%a001250
	I thought eyevory tusk-tusk ink was a souvenir from the human world. I didn't expect to find some here in the Faerie Palace.
Tuppence
	A history of the entire world? Then he'll probably end up writing about me once I'm married.
Tuppence
	I'm planning on becoming rather more famous than I am at present, you see.
Bianca
	The ink of an eyevory tusk-tusk and a faerie quill... Sounds like the perfect combination. Just like you and me, eh?
%0%a001240
	I can't think of anything worse than ink like that.
%0%a001240
	What if you made a mistake?
	You'd never be able to erase it!
%0%a001250
	I wish I had a faerie quill...
%0%a001240
	The world being at peace or not even has an impact here. We have to succeed, Dad!
Sancho
	We are lucky, no? Eef we no use these
	geefts carefully, the Goddess, eshe weell be
	very, very angry.
Tuppence
	Faeries are ever so generous, aren't they?
Tuppence
	I wonder if they'd be as generous with their hearts, and agree to be married...
%0%a001250
	How sweet! I'm sure we'll be fine with the Goddess sending us her blessings.
%0%a001240
	I wonder why you have to be holding it, Dad.
	I don't get it. I thought that thing was supposed
	to be useless, anyhow.
Sancho
	Now you are a real man, friend. Ees right that you are responsible for the important items.
%0%a001250
	Why don't you try doing what she said, Dad?
	Try standing in front of the picture.
%0%a001240
	Are you okay, Dad? You just wouldn't move or anything, like you were unconscious! We were
	really worried.
%0%a001240
	Hey! That's not the gold bauble you got from Queen Caramel, is it, Dad? What's going on?
%0%a001240
	No, don't tell me! Let me figure it out for myself...
	Um... Er... Hmmm...
%0%a001250
	It's good to have you back, Dad. It's okay.
	You don't have to explain a thing.
Sancho
	Are you okay? Ees, ees no time for a siesta now, you know.
Tuppence
	Are you alright, %a000090? I was just about to send for a doctor, you know.
%0%a001240
	Are you okay, Dad? You just wouldn't move or anything, like you were unconscious! We were
	really worried.
%0%a001250
	It's good to have you back, Dad.
Sancho
	Are you okay? Ees, ees no time for a siesta now, you know.
Tuppence
	Are you alright, %a000090? I was just about to send for a doctor, you know.
%0%a001240
	%0%a001250's much better than me when it comes to painting.
%0%a001250
	The boy in that picture looks just like %a001240!
Sancho
	I remember when you were born, My Majesty.
	Sí, an artist, he came to draw your
	picture too.
Bianca
	I can't help feelin' like I've bin to the place in that picture. I just can't quite fathom where it is.
Nera
	I really love that picture. I hope you'll bring me here to look at it again one day.
%0%a001250
	That picture has a really nice feel to it.
	Sort of warm somehow.
Tuppence
	The Zenith Dragon was that Dr Agon chap,
	wasn't he?
Tuppence
	It's rather difficult to imagine a man like him giving a picture as a present!
%0%a001240
	For a while? I wonder how long...
	Maybe they'll change it when we
	bring peace to the world.
Tuppence
	Ooh! I can't help hoping that the next painting they hang will be one in my honour!
%0%a001240
	That cat just spoke to us! Do you think it really is
	a magician?
%0%a001250
	Urgh! That cat gives me the creeps.
Tuppence
	How ingenious! If only I could learn how to turn myself into a cat. The possibilities would be endless!
Bianca
	Well, it takes all sorts. Who are we to interfere?
Nera
	I'm sure the faeries must know what's really going on with that cat. Don't you think, darling?
Tuppence
	Meow! Meow! Meow!
Tuppence
	I thought I'd better get in some practice in case I ever manage to turn myself into a cat!
Debora
	What a mist! We could get really lost in here if we weren't careful. Hold my hand, okay?
Debora
	Hey! What are you doing? I was talking to the kids, not you, %a000090!
Debora
	What a lovely lake.
	Almost as lovely as me!
Debora
	It's quite a sweet-looking place, don't you think?
Debora
	I don't mind it, but I prefer my palaces to look a bit more glitzy.
Debora
	If I'm a descendant of the Zenithians, then I suppose that makes Nera one as well.
Debora
	So the Goddess obviously intended for me to have you at my disposal. Nice idea!
Debora
	It obviously pays to have a bit of faith sometimes.
Debora
	Do you love someone other than me, %a000090?
Debora
	...Ah, of course. Well, if you must go and see your other ⓗloveⓘ, I suppose I'll allow it.
Debora
	Surely it would be easier to get in disguised as a faerie rather than a cat.
Nera
	It is rather odd not to have heard anything about my true parents despite all this travelling about we're doing.
Nera
	I suppose there are lots and lots of Zenithians who came down to our world at some time or another. They must have lots of descendants here.
Nera
	Ooh, I just realised! If I'm a descendant of the Zenithians, then Debora must be too!
