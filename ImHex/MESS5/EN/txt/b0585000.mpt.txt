Bianca
	It's nice that you're showin' me around lots of places, but we en't really got time for this, have we?
Bianca
	It's amazin' to be able to walk around together again like this.
Bianca
	After all those years of not even gettin' a glimpse of daylight!
Nera
	Even when we visit somewhere we've been before,
	it has a different feel to it now.
Nera
	Maybe that's part of getting older.
Nera
	I'm really happy that you're taking me to lots of different places, darling.
Nera
	But I think perhaps we should focus on the
	task at hand.
%0%a001240
	You know your way around loads of different places, don't you, Dad?
%0%a001240
	We travelled a lot when we were looking for you
	and Mum.
%0%a001240
	I didn't think there was anywhere left I hadn't been to. It's pretty exciting!
%0%a001250
	Yay! I'm so happy. It's really nice that you take us to all sorts of places with you.
%0%a001250
	I'm not very good in dark places. Or high places.
	Or hot places, actually.
%0%a001250
	But I'd still like to keep on travelling with you!
Sancho
	Esee, friend?
	%0%a001240 and %a001250, they are fine children, no?
Sancho
	Your Uncle Sancho, he ees eso lucky.
	First, I esee you grow eento the estrong, macho man.
	And now, I watch your children grow too.
Sancho
	Uf! Ees eso beeg, the world. Now we are together weeth you, My Majesty, ees eso many places we can go.
Tuppence
	I must just jot down a memo about this place before I forget about it. I want to include everything in my autobiography, you see.
Bianca
	This tower... Of course I remember it.
	How could I possibly forget?
Bianca
	How come you brought us to this tower of all places?
Nera
	Here... I'd rather forget this place ever existed.
Nera
	But I suppose it would be wrong to forget. It's difficult memories like that that spur us on to do what we're doing now.
Nera
	Is it alright if we leave now, darling? I think we've been here long enough.
%0%a001240
	I don't like the feel of this place. I think I can even smell blood on the walls. Urgh!
%0%a001240
	I know about this place. This is where you and Mum were turned into stone.
%0%a001240
	............
%0%a001250
	I feel a bit funny in this place.
	I think I'm going to be sick...
%0%a001250
	Can we get out of here, Dad? I don't like it.
Sancho
	When I came here before weeth the esoldiers to thees tower, there was no one here.
Sancho
	That night, eef we no have thees fiesta...
	Eef we no dreenk...
Tuppence
	This tower has the most frightful feel to it. It's sending shivers down my spine just standing here.
Bianca
	So this is the spot. This is where you were auctioned off, %a000090.
Nera
	This is where we were separated from each
	other, isn't it?
Nera
	Just remembering it makes me well up.
%0%a001240
	Wow! So this is where the statue of you was sold?
%0%a001240
	Twenty thousand gold coins... I'd never be able to afford you with the kind of pocket money I get.
%0%a001250
	Dad...
%0%a001250
	Um... Never mind. I was just thinking you looked a bit sad, that's all.
Sancho
	No one ees coming here no more, no? Ees just the deserted ruin. Just the remains of what ees once here before.
Tuppence
	So this is where your statue was sold, is it?
	Twenty thousand gold coins!?
Tuppence
	That's extortionate! Er... I mean, that's not nearly enough for a man of your calibre. I'd pay much more!
Debora
	You must be thrilled to be able to travel around with me again.
Debora
	I still feel a bit stiff after all that time as a statue. You'll have to help me out while I'm getting back into the swing of things.
Debora
	I know you're probably enjoying travelling about the place and reliving all our yesterdays, but it's about time we moved on.
Debora
	There are things we need to do.
Debora
	I remember this place. How could I forget?
	Try as I might, I doubt I'll ever forget it.
Debora
	I'd rather not come here again. It just reminds me of what happened and gets me all worked up.
Debora
	This is where the two of us were separated, isn't it, %a000090?
Debora
	It annoys me just thinking about it. I can't believe you only fetched twenty thousand gold coins!
Tuppence
	There's no sniff of any pretty ladies here, I'm afraid. What a disappointment!
Debora
	No sniff of pretty ladies!?
	I dare you to say that again, Tuppence!
Tuppence
	Er, I, er, I mean apart from you, D-Debora.
	No sniff of pretty ladies apart from you.
Debora
	That's more like it. You really do need to think
	before you speak. You're one of the royal
	guards, remember.
