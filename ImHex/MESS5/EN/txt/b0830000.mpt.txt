Patty
	Welcome to Patty's Party Planning Place!
	
Patty
	If you want to pick up new members for your party, this is the place to be! Same goes if you want to ditch a party member, for that matter.
Patty
	So, how can I help you today?
Patty
	But you've already got plenty of company there as it is!
Patty
	You'll have to leave someone behind if you're determined to add a new member to your party.
Patty
	Yikes! I'm afraid you don't have anyone available to join your party. Sorry!
Patty
	So, who do you want to take along with you?
Patty
	You want %a000180 to join you? No problemo!
Patty
	%0%a000180! %0%a000090's here to see you.
~ %0%a000180 joins the party. ~
~ %0%a000180 runs off to the wagon outside. ~
Patty
	Can I fetch anyone else for you while you're here?
Patty
	You want to drop someone off?
	Erm, sorry to break it to you, but you're all alone right now, %a000090.
Patty
	Who do you want to leave behind?
Patty
	I'm sure there are still some important things %a000090 needs to do, don't you think?
Patty
	Sorry, but we're not properly equipped for looking after monsters here.
Patty
	You'd be better off going to an expert who knows how to handle them properly.
Patty
	Yikes! That's a bit mean, trying to ditch someone when they're in such a sorry state.
Patty
	Got it. Looks like you can have a rest for a while, %a000180.
Patty
	%0%a000180's in the wagon, right?
Patty
	I'll be sure to let %A0180%Xhim%Z%B0180%Xher%Z%C0180%Xit%Z know that %A0180%Xhe%Z%B0180%Xshe%Z%C0180%Xit%Z should return here.
Patty
	I'll put anything %a000180 doesn't have equipped in your bag there, okay?
Patty
	Do you want to drop anyone else off while you're here?
Patty
	Oh, you've changed your mind?
	Probably for the best.
Patty
	Yikes! I'm afraid I don't have any of your party members staying with me at the moment.
Patty
	You want to check up on how your pals are getting along? Sure. Who do you want to see first?
Patty
	Do you want to see how anyone else is getting along?
Patty
	Can I do anything else for you today?
Patty
	Then we're done! Call again soon!
