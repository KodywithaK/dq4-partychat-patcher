Bianca
	It's hard to believe that anyone lives in a place like this, eh?
Nera
	I never imagined there'd be a town here in Nadiria. That was the last thing I expected.
%0%a001240
	It's good to find a town like this. The monsters
	are really strong around here, so we could do
	with a rest.
%0%a001250
	What a strangely shaped town. It looks a bit like a flower when you see it from a distance.
Sancho
	Outside, ees a very dark atmosphere, but here een the town, ees no like that. Ees nice.
Sancho
	You know, friend, maybe ees a good idea to make preparations for our journey here before we leave.
Tuppence
	You don't suppose Queen Mada is here somewhere, do you?
Tuppence
	Well, even if she's not, I doubt she can be too far away now.
Bianca
	I never thought we'd find ourselves back here again.
Bianca
	Being here reminds me of your mum, you see.
Nera
	Are you alright, darling? There's lots of talk of your mother here, isn't there?
%0%a001240
	I'll never rest until I've avenged Grandma's death!
%0%a001250
	What a strangely shaped town. It looks a bit like a flower when you see it from a distance.
Sancho
	I estill feel the power from señora Mada here een thees town, even after eshe has passed away now.
Sancho
	Ees reaching us, even from the heavens, eso far, far away.
Tuppence
	There's still plenty of fight in me! Winning is all about attitude. As long as you never give in, victory can't be too far away.
%0%a001240
	I thought that slime was picking on him for a minute, but it looks like they're friends.
%0%a001250
	Rocket? Who would give a slime a name like Rocket!?
%0%a001250
	Ha ha! That slime had a really funny face.
Bianca
	So there's only one town in the whole place. Looks like we're on our own from here on in then, eh?
Nera
	Did you see the flowers there? She's got her own little garden going.
%0%a001240
	Wow. There are loads of people living here.
	I never expected that.
%0%a001250
	This place has a strange feel to it. A sort of warmth. It's not scary at all.
Tuppence
	So this place is called Precarius, is it?
	Or was it Precautionary? No... I do believe
	she said Promiscuous!
Bianca
	Now there's a surprise. Sounds like your
	mum's thought of as somethin' of a saviour
	'round these parts.
Nera
	I wonder how your mother can have felt, rescuing this place when she was in dire need of being rescued herself.
%0%a001240
	I get it. It must be the holy water that keeps the monsters away from this place.
%0%a001250
	I hope we get to meet Grandma soon.
	She sounds really special.
Sancho
	Qué!? Madalena? Thees ees the name of señora Mada! You mean, eshe was here, een thees town!?
Sancho
	Sí, eshe has no changed. Always eshe likes to help people. I, I... I miss her eso, eso... (blub)
Bianca
	That's a bit of a worry, eh? Sounds like all the folk here used to be monsters at some time or other.
Nera
	Fancy that! Not only have they left behind their monstrous behaviour, but they've changed from
	their monstrous forms too.
Nera
	It sounds like your mother's powers really are a force to be reckoned with.
%0%a001240
	The human world is the world we live in, right?
	I didn't know it had a name.
%0%a001250
	So monsters can get turned into humans if they have a change of heart? It's the first I've heard of it.
Sancho
	Ees interesting, sí? We must believe een what
	thees monster, he tells us, and try to become
	the fine humans, eh?
Tuppence
	It doesn't sound like many folk venture here from the human world, does it?
Tuppence
	I feel rather proud to be part of such an elite
	little group.
Bianca
	The people living here are much more fun than you'd imagine, eh?
Nera
	He he! What a funny chap. It's hard to believe he was ever a monster.
%0%a001240
	Oh, I get it. If monsters turn into humans, they
	get fat.
%0%a001240
	Wait a minute! You don't think that means Sancho...
%0%a001240
	No, surely not!
%0%a001250
	His tummy was all wobbly!
Tuppence
	Hellfire and brimstone? I had no idea that monsters thought about that kind of thing too.
Bianca
	It won't be long before we find out the answer, eh? We'll soon see whether the legendary hero's a match for that Nimzo or not.
Nera
	Fancy still having respect for the Grandmaster even after being turned into a human! Nimzo must have quite a hold on people.
%0%a001240
	Grandmaster Nimzo... I know he's meant to be really strong. But I'm stronger!
%0%a001250
	It's weird that he's still loyal to Nimzo even though he's a human now. Don't you think?
Sancho
	Thees Nimzo, he has many followers.
	He must be a powerful capitán, no?
Sancho
	You must no let your guard down when you meet heem, friend.
Tuppence
	I can sort of understand why that soldier said the things he said.
Tuppence
	Loyalty is supposed to be unwavering in the face of all challenges, after all.
Tuppence
	It's just like if I were to become a monster. I'm sure my loyalty to you would remain the same, %a000090.
Bianca
	That bloke there was human, right? Looks like the humans are the bad guys in this place, then!
Nera
	That was a human, wasn't it? How odd! It seems the humans are worse than the monsters in this place.
%0%a001240
	That took me by surprise! He was a baddie,
	wasn't he?
%0%a001250
	He stole some treasure? The person he took it from must be really upset.
Tuppence
	I didn't expect to have a battle sprung on me here!
	It looks like we really can't afford to let down our guard in this place.
Bianca
	You've got a bit of a funny look on your face, %a000090. Does that staff mean somethin' to you?
%0%a001250
	Who'd have thought we'd find a Stolos' staff here? It's really nice to have one again.
Bianca
	It's a good job there's an inn here in Nadiria for
	us, eh?
%0%a001250
	Wow! Look at all those books! This place is more like a library than an inn.
Bianca
	Is he sayin' Nimzo might force his way into the
	human world?
Bianca
	That'd be terrible. We have to stop him before it comes to that.
%0%a001240
	Um, Dad. That man was a Zenithian, right?
%0%a001240
	It's a bit of a surprise to see one of them in Nadiria.
%0%a001250
	He seemed to be quite badly injured.
	I hope he's alright.
Bianca
	Her spark of life is growin' weaker?
	Oh no! We have to hurry, %a000090!
Bianca
	I'll never forget that look your mum had on her face when the time come.
Bianca
	She seemed to relax a bit when your dad appeared on the scene.
Nera
	Oh dear! It sounds like your mother is in terrible peril. We have to hurry!
Nera
	Your mother's spark of life has been
	extinguished now.
Nera
	But I'm sure she's watching over us from above with your father and sending us her blessings.
%0%a001250
	That's terrible! There's no time to lose, Dad!
%0%a001250
	Grandma...
Sancho
	How long ees señora Mada fighting all on
	her own?
Sancho
	My Majesty! Ees no time to lose.
	You must help your madre rápido!
Bianca
	Ha! Looks like havin' a tipple in this world could have some pretty serious consequences!
%0%a001240
	I didn't know that! So drinking turns people
	into monsters?
Sancho
	They esay eef you dreenk too much alcohol, you become like a monster. Here, ees really true, sí?
	Maybe the alcohol, ees here to test the monsters.
Sancho
	Eh! Perdón, friend. I forget you are no old enough to understand thees theengs.
Nera
	Well, we don't want to do anything that will cause us any regrets.
%0%a001250
	If drinking is so bad, then what's the point in there being a pub here?
Tuppence
	You can't blame a man for succumbing to a drink here. Not with a beauty like that serving it up to you.
%0%a001240
	Wow! What a huge wheel!
%0%a001250
	Ouch! My neck's started to hurt from looking up
	so much!
Sancho
	Be careful! Eef you are caught een the teeth, ees no gonna be eso pretty, eh?
Bianca
	That poor creature seemed a bit lonely.
	I wonder why it was all by itself here.
%0%a001240
	It does feel quite good, actually.
	Long may it last!
Nera
	I don't really believe that humans can turn
	into monsters.
Nera
	Or I don't want to believe it! Imagine how terrifying a half-man half-beast would be!
%0%a001250
	Have you got any regrets, Dad? I hope not.
	I'd feel really bad for you if you did.
Bianca
	You dun't think he's talkin' about Nimzo, do you?
Nera
	He must have had a really evil heart to have turned into a monster! I wonder if such all-encompassing evil really does exist.
%0%a001250
	What do you suppose happened to him in the end? Maybe he got attacked for being a monster.
Tuppence
	I wonder why he wanted to become a god.
Tuppence
	I'm not too sure that's ever a good idea. I mean, think of that Dr Agon character.
Debora
	So there's a town in Nadiria. It's a pity they don't have a clothes shop. The fashion here could be quite interesting if they did.
Debora
	There's still lots of talk of your mother here, even after her death.
Debora
	Only one town... I'd quite like to buy Papa a souvenir, but I can't see anywhere to buy one.
Debora
	Your mother was really quite special.
	They do say that if a parent shines too much, their children will be dull, mind you...
Debora
	So the inhabitants of this place all used to
	be monsters.
Debora
	When are you going to become someone special like your mother was, %a000090?
Debora
	How silly! He can't blame being fat on being
	well-rounded!
Debora
	I'm the most well-rounded person I know, and there's not a scrap of fat on me!
Debora
	He's incredibly loyal to still respect Nimzo even now. He'd probably make an excellent servant.
Debora
	It's Nimzo who'd be powerless, though, not our hero. He was wrong there!
Debora
	Why would he steal like that? As long as I had money, I'd never think of stealing.
Debora
	Do you recognise that staff?
	Oh! It's %a001250's?
Debora
	It's quite impressive that the thief made it all the way to Nadiria, don't you think? He must've come after we opened the way.
Debora
	So this is what a Nadirian inn looks like.
	I wonder how the food tastes.
Debora
	There's no need for him to make such a song and dance about it. We'll sort Nimzo out.
Debora
	Hmph. He's not listening.
	Maybe we should give him a slap.
	He obviously needs waking up from his nightmare.
Debora
	And you're the one to do it! Now's not the time to be hanging around in pubs!
Debora
	We don't have time to hang around here. It's time to make Nimzo pay for what he did to your mother.
Debora
	There are plenty of people in our world who turn into monsters when they've had a drink.
Debora
	Why are you looking so aggravated?
	I wasn't pointing any fingers!
Debora
	She has an easy time of it, working in a pub and refusing to serve drink! Even I wouldn't mind working in a pub like that.
Debora
	Correct answer! You shouldn't have any regrets, what with being married to me and everything.
Debora
	How dare you! You can't possibly have any regrets. You're married to me, remember!
Debora
	What a fool. He had it all wrong from the outset, wanting to become a god.
Debora
	He sounds just like the idiots who turn up at the casino to make their fortunes and end up penniless.
