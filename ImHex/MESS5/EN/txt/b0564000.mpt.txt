	This place is huge. Fancy being able to
	fit a whole ship inside!
%0%a001240
	The breeze tastes all salty. I suppose it's always like this by the sea.
%0%a001240
	Do you think someone made this? Or do you think it's natural? It's amazing, don't you think, Dad?
%0%a001250
	It's pitch black, but you can still see the waves glistening. How pretty!
%0%a001250
	Someone's calling us... They don't want us now.
	They say to come later.
%0%a001250
	I can hear the waves coming crashing in.
	What a sound!
Sancho
	Ees no need to worry een here. Eef we are lost, we have the eseafood all around. We can make the paella! SÃ­, ees a good idea, no?
Sancho
	Maybe, when we finally reach the end of thees tunnel, we come to a new world, no?
Sancho
	Don't you theenk eso too, friend?
	Maybe the world full of paella!
Sancho
	Esometimes een the dark, you can esee the hands.
	But who ees the owner of these hands, eh?
Sancho
	Ees no like the normal cave. Thees place, eet has the feeling of the cathedral or the waiting room of the medic. Ees no place for a fiesta, eh?
Tuppence
	............
Tuppence
	Oh! Sorry! I was totally taken up with
	looking at the scenery.
Tuppence
	You can see a faint blue light in the darkness.
	What an odd cave this is!
Bianca
	This place is certainly big enough. There's not many a cave you can sail a ship through.
Bianca
	Look how high the ceilin' is as well! This place dun't feel anythin' like any other caves I've bin in.
Nera
	It's funny feeling a breeze from outside even though we're in a cave. It's a nice feeling.
Nera
	I can't explain it, but it feels like this cave doesn't try to shut people out.
Bianca
	I wonder what this place is. It feels almost like a temple or somethin'.
Nera
	What do you suppose this place is? It looks almost like a temple or a shrine.
%0%a001240
	This looks like the entrance to a shrine or something.
	I wonder what kind of key you need to get inside.
%0%a001250
	I'm sensing that there's something mysterious inside. What do you think it could be?
Sancho
	Ees no gonna open, eh? First you must ask around for information. Maybe you weell find esometheeng about unlocking eet.
Bianca
	This must be Estuary Sanctuary. That means we're finally at the place where you can open the doors to Nadiria...and your mother.
Nera
	This has to be Estuary Sanctuary. It's time, darling.
%0%a001240
	What do you think that statue's all about, Dad?
	It's a bit odd, don't you think?
%0%a001240
	Grandma said we mustn't come, but that doesn't mean we'll get told off if we do, does it?
%0%a001240
	She won't end up hating us or anything, will she?
%0%a001250
	I don't like this place.
	There's lots of nastiness in the air.
Sancho
	Thees ees eet, My Majesty! Ees the place we have been looking for, I am esure!
Sancho
	Now remember what Uncle Sancho, he always tell you, friend. Check you have no forgotten esometheeng important.
Tuppence
	The sound of the water running by is
	almost deafening.
Tuppence
	I wonder what lies ahead of us now...
%0%a001240
	I wonder why the statues have their arms stretched out like that. Hey! You don't think...
Bianca
	Those doors to the underworld... Just lookin' at them gives me the willies.
Nera
	So we've finally opened the doors to Nadiria.
	I can already sense an ill-omened air.
%0%a001240
	The entrance at the waterfall... There it is, Dad.
%0%a001250
	Um, Dad... Are we going through? Or aren't we?
Debora
	I thought all caves were as bad as each other, but this place is actually quite pleasant.
Debora
	It doesn't look like this cave is natural, but who would build something like this and why?
Debora
	I'll never understand why anyone would go to the effort of building a cave. It's such a waste of time and money.
Debora
	How irritating that we can't go inside!
Debora
	You'll have to find a key so we can open it up, %a000090.
Debora
	This has to be Estuary Sanctuary.
	Come on, %a000090. Follow me!
Debora
	So the entrance to Nadiria is open. Come on, %a000090. This is what we've been waiting for.
