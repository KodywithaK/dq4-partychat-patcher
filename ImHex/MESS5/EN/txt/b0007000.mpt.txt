*: 
	I'm sure I just saw King Wilbur going upstairs with the Queen Dowager.
*: 
	And yet I can't have done, because I don't remember seeing Her Majesty come downstairs in the first place. I'm going mad!
*: 
	Is somebody there?
*: 
	I've been down here so long now that my eyes and ears have stopped working on me.
*: 
	But my mouth works just fine, so let me tell you this!
*: 
	The person responsible for Prince Harry's death is none other than the Queen Dowager!
*: 
	And yet she put on a good show of being distressed by the whole thing and then laid all of the blame squarely on Pankraz's shoulders!
*: 
	The cheek of the woman! She even took it so far as to destroy Pankraz's village, Whealbrook.
*: 
	I've never seen a woman so cruel and cold-hearted. The Goddess will punish her for this!
~ There's no response. ~
~ It's just a corpse. ~
Chancellor
	You wish to see King Wilbur?
	Well, now's not the time!
Chancellor
	It's all too weird. First of all His Majesty came by with the Queen Dowager...
Chancellor
	And now... You won't believe this!
	...There are two of them!
*: 
	This makes no sense whatsoever! Two Queen Dowagers all of a sudden! And they were at each other's ⓚⓛ Clank! ⓚⓛ throats when they met!
*: 
	We managed to somehow pull them apart, but now King Wilbur is ⓚⓛ Clank! ⓚⓛ puzzling over which one is which!
King Wilbur
	I just can't seem to figure out which one of them is my real mother.
King Wilbur
	I really wanted to sort this out for myself, Harry.
King Wilbur
	But I just seem to always get these things wrong...
Queen Dowager
	Don't you know your own mother, Wilbur?
	Come on. Come to Mummy!

	Curses! That wretched mirror!
	Now the truth is out!
Faux Dowager
	Now I have no choice but to kill you all!
*: 
	I haven't seen a thing!
	You should keep ⓚⓛ Clank! ⓚⓛ quiet too, if you know what's good for you.
King Wilbur
	What is the meaning of all this? What's a monster doing pretending to be my mother?
Queen Dowager
	You no-good monster! If you lay a finger on my son, I'll have your guts for garters!
Faux Dowager
	You don't know when to give up, do you? I'll tear you limb from limb this time, just you wait!
Faux Dowager
	You're stronger than you look, feeble humans.
Faux Dowager
	If it weren't for you, I could've become ruler of Coburg...and ruler of the world! Grurrrgh!
~ %3So the Queen Dowager was an impostor!%4 ~
~ %3The news spread like wildfire throughout the kingdom that evening, and then morning came.%4 ~
King Wilbur
	You and my brother did a wonderful job of defeating that impostor, %a000090.
King Wilbur
	I can't thank you enough. I hate to imagine what would've become of Coburg if you hadn't come along.
King Wilbur
	I must be the worst king there ever was.
King Wilbur
	I was thinking... Maybe it would be better if Harry were king. Could you help me to persuade him, %a000090?
Harry
	Your Majesty.
	I'm afraid I must turn down your request.
King Wilbur
	But, Harry...
Harry
	A lackey should always listen to his master, remember!
Harry
	Naturally, though, I'll do everything I can to assist you.
Harry
	Which means... I'm afraid our journey together must come to an end, %a000090.
Harry
	It's been a lot of fun, but the time's come for us to say goodbye.
Harry
	All of the weapons and things you bought me are in your bag, okay?
Harry
	Good luck with the rest of your journey, %a000090!
King Wilbur
	You've been an invaluable help here, %a000090.
King Wilbur
	I'm going to work really hard with Harry from now on to make Coburg a happy place for people to live.
Queen Dowager
	I don't know what to say. No words are enough to express the gratitude I feel for what you did.
Queen Dowager
	None of it would have happened if I hadn't been so conceited.
Queen Dowager
	I'm going to work harder than anyone from now on to make amends.
Queen Dowager
	I'll help Wilbur as much as I can, but I swear that I won't meddle in the kingdom's affairs ever again.
Chancellor
	If Wilbur and Harry can rule the kingdom together successfully, then we'll finally have peace and prosperity in Coburg again!
Maria
	It was so much fun being able to travel with you and Harry, %a000090.
Maria
	But it's time I returned to the abbey now, so I suppose this is goodbye.
Maria
	You're no doubt continuing on your journey in search of the legendary hero and, of course, your mother.
Maria
	I wish you lots of success.
	I'll be praying for your safety.
Harry
	Now things are back to normal, there'll be ships sailing into Littlehaven again soon.
Harry
	No doubt you're planning on continuing your journey from there.
Harry
	Ah! Wait a minute!
Harry
	There's this thing I found back during our years as slaves.
Harry
	It's a bit crumpled now, but I want you to have it.

	Thanks to you, Coburg is well on its way back to normality. Thank you so much!

	Who'd have thought that Prince Harry was still alive after all these years? What a pleasant surprise!

	It's a great feeling, being able to welcome people with a smile again!

	Legend has it that long ago, a castle came falling from the sky.

	Prince Harry is so brave and kind.

	Things have begun to liven up here now that ships are sailing into Littlehaven again.
*: 
	I travelled here from a land far across the ocean to the west.
*: 
	There was talk back there on the continent of Zephyrus about some legendary shield.
	I never came across it, mind.
*: 
	Yippee! The nasty Queen Dowager was an impostor! Yay!
*: 
	Welcome to Coburg.
*: 
	Ever since Prince Harry came home, this place has been gettin' better by the day!

	My sister's come back safe and sound from Fortuna at last! Anyway, down to business...
*: 
	There's no stopping Coburg now! The kingdom and its people are getting richer by the day. Whoopee!
*: 
	Who can drame a man for blinking at a time like this!? Hic!
*: 
	The stars are so pretty. Aaah!
*: 
	This is just between you and me, but there are some really terrifying monsters attacking people over on that continent Apeliotes to the east.
*: 
	Some folk there are even saying that the end of the world is upon us.
*: 
	I'm really pleased my sister's back from Fortuna safe and sound.
*: 
	But she's changed so much. I don't know whether to be happy or sad!
*: 
	Hello there, young man! Aren't you lovely! How would you like to have your fortune told?
*: 
	Oh! You've never had your fortune told before?
*: 
	Hmm... I sense that perhaps you're not ready quite yet. Maybe one day when you're all grown up and married.

	Well, not to worry. The spirits tell me that the girl for you is just around the corner!

*: 
	Yee-haw! You got yourself a deal!
	I'll put your wagon outside, and you have yourself a mighty fine trip, pardner.
*: 
	Oh, just before you saddle up and move out,
	you might wanna stop in on old Monty, the
	monster monitor.
*: 
	He's a regular crackerjack when it comes to usin' wagons. He's the expert, if you're lookin' for advice.
*: 
	Okay, pardner. You're the boss!
*: 
	Sorry, pardner, but you look to be a little
	short of cash.
*: 
	Yee-haw! You got yourself a deal!
	I'll put your wagon outside, and you have yourself a mighty fine trip, pardner.
*: 
	I'll be puttin' up more unusual items for sale

	again, y'hear?
*: 
	Now you look like a seasoned old trav'ller to me, pardner. In that case, you won't wanna be without this here Big Book of Beasts!
*: 
	I wanna say three thousand gold coins for it, but I just can't resist givin' you a discount, pardner! So how about we settle on a thousand?

	Yee-ha! You got yourself a deal!
	I'll just go on and put it in your bag for you.

	Soon as I get myself some more unusual items,

	I am a wandering warrior, travelling the world in search of a peaceful haven in which to rest my weary head.

	You're not thinking of going off overseas without a horse and cart, are you?
*: 
	I wouldn't advise it. They say there are some really vicious monsters over on the continent of Zephyrus.
*: 
	A ship! A ship's come in!
*: 
	Better hurry up or you'll miss the boarding.
*: 
	On you go! This ship's sailing for the continent of Zephyrus!

	Ah! More passengers.

	But that should be the lot, I reckon.

	All aboard!

	Anchors aweigh!
	Hoist the mainsail!
*: 
	Has a ship come in?
	Of course not! It's pitch black outside!
*: 
	Maybe one'll come in tomorrow.
	Why don't you come back in the morning?
*: 
	Ah-phew... Ah-phew...
	Ah, at last... Ah, a ship...
	Ah-phew... Ah-phew...
*: 
	Ah-phew... Ah-phew...
	Zzz...
*: 
	My husband does nothing but nap!
*: 
	But I suppose it's a good thing, really.
	Peaceful times, peaceful times!
*: 
	Righto! That's all the passengers disembarked.
*: 
	You want to get back on board? I'm afraid we can't take on any more passengers at the moment.
*: 
	The ferry to Littlehaven was attacked and sunk by monsters a little while back.
*: 
	We were only able to run the service we just did thanks to the millionaire Mr Briscoletti bein' so generous.
*: 
	I hope it won't be long before the world's safe enough for us to start sailin' again.
*: 
	If we don't sail, we don't work, see.
	Simple as that.
*: 
	I heard that the ferry to Littlehaven sailed the other day, so I came along hoping to be able to get on the next one.
*: 
	But apparently that was the last one to go. How's a fella supposed to get to that White King's Paradise at this rate, eh?
*: 
	See the lighthouse just there? There's a scary ogre livin' at the top of it!
*: 
	If you value your life, you won't be going near the place in a hurry!
*: 
	Eh? No ogre in the lighthouse, you say?
*: 
	Ha ha! You didn't take me seriously, did ya?
	I was only jokin'!
*: 
	My son was always a fine sailor.
*: 
	But then his boat was attacked by monsters.
*: 
	It's very painful for me to think about what happened to him.
*: 
	Hey! Have you heard?
*: 
	Then it's true!
	I wish I could learn how to do it.
*: 
	Seems there used to be an ancient spell that would allow you to return to castles and towns you've visited in an instant.
*: 
	Can you imagine how great it would be if you knew a spell like that!? You could go travelling off all over the place!
*: 
	Rumour has it that the Kingdom of Coburg is planning on conquering the world.
*: 
	They don't seem to be doing much about it so far, mind you. I'm starting to think it was all just a hoax.
*: 
	Urgh. What a hangover! Maybe I had one too many last night.
*: 
	This is Lodestar Harbour.
*: 
	According to ancient manuscripts, there's a giant dragon god that reigns over our world.
*: 
	If that were true, though, why would he allow the monsters to run riot like they are?
*: 
	Come from Boreas, did you? I was born on that continent meself!
*: 
	I know! I'll let you in on a secret, one Borean to another, like!
*: 
	Take a good look at the flower bed by the church. You never know what you might find.
*: 
	I used to want to be a pharmacist, y'know.
*: 
	But then the bloke who was teachin' me all about medicine went and popped his clogs.
*: 
	Of all the luck! I used to love livin' over Whealbrook way, an' all!
*: 
	When I grow up, I'm going to be a sailor and I'm going to travel all around the world!
*: 
	And I'm going to collect lots of treasure too!
	It'll be amazing!
*: 
	My stacks! 'Elp me! Someone 'elp me!
*: 
	No one's gonna help you now!
	We said we'd do what you asked, right?
*: 
	So now you've gotta give us the dosh!
*: 
	No! I can't be trustin' you!
*: 
	That gold belongs to the village. We's all chipped 'n' chirped in, we 'ave.
*: 
	You stubborn idiot!
	Lookin' for trouble, are ya!?
*: 
	What's your problem? Want a piece of the action, do ya!?
*: 
	Then that's what you've got! We don't take too kindly to people stickin' their noses into our business!
*: 
	Oh, yeah? You tryin' to pretend you didn't see nothin', are ya? I can't stand people like you.
*: 
	You reckon you're so superior, don't ya, eh?
	I say it's time someone put you in your place!
*: 
	Huh! We won't be forgettin' this in a hurry!
*: 
	Thank you, sir! Thank you kindlier!
*: 
	You'm the kind o' man we should be trustin',
	I reckon.
*: 
	Would you be willin' to take on a little task for us?
*: 
	Oo-ar! Thank you!
*: 
	I'm only gonna say 'im the once, so them ears o' yourn better be squeaky clean, you 'ear?
*: 
	The thing is, there be a savage monster what's messin' up all our crops in the village.
*: 
	'E's that bad as we'll all likely be dyin' of starvination if we dun't do somethin' smartish.
*: 
	An' that's why I'm 'ere. To find us a good, strong warrior what's gonna scare off the monster.
*: 
	I reckon I gone an' struck gold with you! You'm a right brawny bay, en't ya?
*: 
	I'm not talkin' about workin' for free, y'understand. There's gold in it for ya.

	Three thousand gold's what we's off'rin'. 'Alf now, an' one more 'alf later.
~ %0%a000120 receives one thousand ~

*: 
	You'll get the rest o' the gold after you's scared off that there monster.
*: 
	Fare 'e well then, me 'andsome. I'll be gettin' along now, back to the village.
*: 
	Oops! I nearly forgot! My village is way down south, called 'Ayⓚⓛ No, Hay. That's it. Always drop the aitch, I do. Can't 'elp it! 
*: 
	Does I need to tell you all that again?

	What it is is, we's wantin' you to scare off

*: 
	Talk about the sticks, mind you! There's not exactly a lot to see there.
*: 
	You're searching for the legendary hero so that you can rescue your mother? That all sounds a bit serious.
*: 
	My husband's a bit of a scholar. One day, he suddenly announced he wanted to go off on his travels.
*: 
	Said something strange about looking for the legendary hero so that he could save the world.

	Hello. The name's Ogar. I've been here for nigh on forty years now. No underworld monster's goin' to stop me keepin' the lighthouse runnin'.
Ogar
	Have you had a look through the telescope? You'll have probably seen the big mountain to the south-east if you did.
Ogar
	That'd be Mt Azimuth. Totally impossible for mere humans to climb.
Ogar
	Apart from the chosen ones, that is. They can climb to the top easy as pie.
Ogar
	Who does the choosin'? Well, that's the big question. It must be the Goddess or some other bigwig, though, eh?
Ogar
	Am I an ogre!? How dare you!
Ogar
	I'm gettin' thoroughly fed up with people constantly askin' that same question!

	(sob) Give my son back! Zzzz...
*: 
	I hear there's the most terrible ogre living in the lighthouse.
*: 
	How frightening! And yet I'd still quite like to climb up to the top...
*: 
	I'm a sailor through and through, me. When I get out on the open waves, I have a job forcin' myself back to dry land from time to time.
*: 
	Her indoors don't say a word about it, though. I picked a good'un there.
*: 
	No no no! My husband's coming home and dinner's not even ready yet!
	Zzzz...
*: 
	I'm so worried. My boy's saying he wants to be a sailor, but it's such a dangerous occupation nowadays.

	See that dancing girl Cleo?
	I'm her biggest fan, me!
*: 
	Come on, Cleo!
	Swing over my way!
*: 
	The girl in the middle is a real looker!
*: 
	I wouldn't mind gettin' married if my wife looked like that!
*: 
	Rumour has it that there's this old man livin' to the west of here who researches spells and the like.
*: 
	Apparently, he has this one up his sleeve that makes travellin' dead easy. I don't buy it meself, mind.
*: 
	Oh! Hello! I hear you're on a hunt for the legendary hero.
*: 
	You may not believe this, but I've actually seen him in the flesh!
*: 
	Shall I tell you all about it? Give me a few coins towards a drink and I'm all yours!
~ %0%a000120 agrees to buy the old man a drink for ten gold coins. ~
*: 
	It was ten years ago now.
*: 
	I met a very powerful-looking man who was searching for the Zenithian Sword.
*: 
	He was planning on collecting all of the Zenithian Equipment so that he could enter the underworld of Nadiria.
*: 
	He looked a bit shabby, but he had the bearing of a king. I'm convinced that he was the legendary hero!
*: 
	That's it! I've just remembered his name!
*: 
	It was Pankraz.
	Yes, I'm sure of it! Pankraz!
~ But then discovers he doesn't have enough money! ~
*: 
	Oh dear.
	That's a shame.
*: 
	Sorry, mate. I seem to have spread a bit of a rumour about you being on a hunt for that legendary hero.
*: 
	'Ow romantic! I 'eard all about your quest to find ze legendary 'ero, %A0110%Xchéri%Z%B0110%Xchérie%Z.
*: 
	Maybe I should go on a quest of my own to find ze knight in shining armour...
*: 
	Huh. Coburg's back to normal again now, so I was thinking of heading over there for a spot of trade.
*: 
	Until I found out that the ships aren't running, that is. Of all the luck!
*: 
	Ah-phew...
*: 
	Zzzz... The Grandmaster of the Underworld is attempting to take over our world...
*: 
	I must find the legendary hero and inform him immediately... Zzzz...
*: 
	Ha ha! You've spotted it too, have you?
*: 
	Pretty good, eh? If you use your head, you can find the best seat in the house!
*: 
	Bravo! Bravo!
*: 
	I wonder if that's it for tonight.
Cleo
	Hm? How does it feel to be so popular? It's great for now, but I know it won't last.
Cleo
	No. This kind of work's only good while
	you've got your youth. That's what my 
	mummy always said.
Cleo
	I don't suppose...
	You don't fancy getting married, do you?
Cleo
	Ha ha! If only it was that simple.
*: 
	Zut! I cannot bear it!
	I am dripping in ze sweat!
*: 
	Aaaaah!
