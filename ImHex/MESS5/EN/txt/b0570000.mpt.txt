	What a transformation! Dr Agon looks totally amazing when he turns into the Zenith Dragon!
%0%a001240
	He should try to be a bit cooler in his human form, then it wouldn't be such a shock when he changes.
%0%a001250
	Dad, our quest's over now, isn't it?
	I mean, the world's at peace, right?
Bianca
	Come on, then. Time to go. The people of Gotha are waitin' for their great leader to come home.
Nera
	You've been so good, %a001240. And you, %a001250. You've both been so wonderⓚⓛ
	Oh, no. Now, now I'm going to cry.
%0%a001240 & %0%a001250
	Don't cry, Mum. Oh, Mum...
%0%a001250
	Dad, our quest's over now, isn't it?
	I mean, the world's at peace, right?
%0%a001240
	Yeah, surely he'll go back to being that cool dragon again soon...won't he, Dad?
%0%a001240
	Hey, Dad. We'd better go and tell all the faeries what's happened sometime, hadn't we?
%0%a001250
	Yes! Sweet joy and candy kisses!
	To you, Dad, and to Mum and %a001240.
	And to everyone! Come on. Let's all dance!
Nera
	Oh, yes! Why don't we all dance?
	I haven't felt so happy in years!
%0%a001240
	Busy but happy, though, right?
	I know exactly how she feels.
Bianca
	That Zenithian got in a flap just now, eh?
Bianca
	D'you reckon the Zenith Dragon has a bit of a temper on him if things en't done right?
Nera
	Should we get going soon? I can't wait to see it with my own eyes. The world at peace!
%0%a001240
	I wonder where Dr Agon is.
%0%a001240
	Zenithia looks amazing now too.
%0%a001240
	It's hard to imagine it was completely flooded not that long ago.
Bianca
	It's hard to know what to do with yourself when someone's showin' so much gratitude, eh?
Bianca
	You deserve all the thanks you get, though, %a000090. You're the one who made all this happen.
%0%a001240
	Wow! Zenithia can fly really, really high, can't it!?
%0%a001240
	Whoa... L-Looking down gives you goosebumps!
Bianca
	Forever and ever and ever, eh?
Bianca
	I sometimes think it wouldn't be such a bad thing if
	I got turned into a statue again one day.
Bianca
	That way, we could stay together for all eternity, you and me lined up side-by-side.
Nera
	Forever and ever...and ever?
Nera
	Some people say your feelings die with you when you pass away.
Nera
	But I know I'll always love you, forever and ever and ever.
%0%a001250
	I've been meaning to ask you, Dad...
%0%a001250
	Why does that old man live behind a fireplace?
Bianca
	It has bin a pretty tough old journey at times, eh?
Bianca
	At least the Goddess was there to guide us every step of the way.
%0%a001250
	It's a slime!
%0%a001250
	What a relief! I was worried that the good monsters would've disappeared from the world too.
Nera
	Is this slime trying to block our path?
	Maybe it doesn't want us to leave here yet.
Bianca
	Ooh, what a pretty sky! It's the perfect backdrop for how triumphant we're all feelin', eh?
Nera
	What a beautiful view! In fact, ever since we were reunited, everything's been just perfect.
Nera
	What? What about the hard times? Well, if there were any hard times, I've completely forgotten
	about them now.
%0%a001240
	Wahoo! Look how high we are!
	Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!
%0%a001250
	B-Be careful, Dad. M-Mind you don't fall.
	It looks like it would hurt.
%0%a001240
	Yes! We're going to get to ride on the
	Zenith Dragon again!
Bianca
	It's a shame we only got to meet your mum the once.
Bianca
	But I'm sure she's watchin' over you all the time. You'd better make sure you stay on your best behaviour!
Nera
	I-I'll never forget your mother.
	She was such a wonderful woman, helping people and monsters even while she was held captive.
%0%a001240
	So, as well as having some of you and Mum in me,
	I've got a little bit of Grandma and Grandpa in me too, right, Dad?
%0%a001240
	That's amazing. I, I feel really lucky.
	Don't you, %a001250?
%0%a001250
	Yes! We are lucky, %a001240.
%0%a001250
	I, I wish I'd had the chance to talk to Grandma more, but I know she's happy now.
%0%a001250
	And whenever I think of her, I can feel her warm, loving eyes watching over us. Even though she's gone, she's still a part of all of us.
Bianca
	It would've bin interestin' to hear your mum's version of events, eh?
Nera
	I know exactly how your mother must have felt then.
Nera
	After all, I've had a light lit in my heart ⓚⓛ by you!
%0%a001240
	So Grandma was a captive princess and Grandpa was the knight who came to rescue her! Cool!
%0%a001250
	It's good that the people of Lofty Peak have realised Grandpa wasn't a bad person at last.
%0%a001240
	I don't have to feel sad any more now when I see Grandma's old room.
%0%a001240
	I mean, she's happy now, isn't she?
	She and Grandpa are together again now.
	I bet they're having fun somewhere.
Bianca
	So the world really is at peace. Comin' back down to earth really brings it home to you.
Nera
	A peaceful world... Is it just me, or does everything feel a bit different now? Even the air seems fresher somehow.
%0%a001240
	Everyone looks so happy.
	That's our reward for all the things we've done.
%0%a001250
	Mum, Grandma's happy now, isn't she?
	Somewhere up in the sky...
Bianca
	Yeah. I doubt we could've defeated Nimzo if it weren't for your mum's help.
%0%a001240
	They mean Grandma, right?
	Madalena was Grandma's full name, wasn't it?
%0%a001240
	Everyone loved my Grandma. That's because she was the best!
%0%a001250
	Ha ha ha! This is so embarrassing!
Nera
	I know! It's difficult taking all this praise, isn't it?
Bianca
	I didn't know your mum and dad eloped! Nice one!
Nera
	It is romantic, isn't it? And all thanks to the hand of destiny. Just like me meeting you was.
%0%a001250
	That woman's completely wrapped up in the whole romantic idea of it all!
Bianca
	I'll be prayin' for 'em, prayin' that they all find their way to the Goddess.
Nera
	She's absolutely right. We mustn't forget all those who died for peace. I'm going to pray for them too.
Nera
	I wonder where mine and Debora's hometown is.
	I mean the place I was born, before Mama and Papa adopted us.
Nera
	Oh well, it's not important. My home's wherever you are now, and that's all that matters to me.
%0%a001240
	Another home! Let's come back here sometimes then, Dad. It's a great place to play!
%0%a001240
	I think he should become a florist. Why not?
%0%a001250
	What a nice man! He's not even slightly upset, even though he won't be able to sell any of his stock now.
Bianca
	Ha ha. It's not like we managed it all by ourselves though, eh?
Bianca
	Folk from all over the world put their faith in us. Without that, we never could've done it.
%0%a001250
	That man smelt like old bottles. He's been in the pub, and it's still the middle of the day!
%0%a001240
	And now the world's at peace, she'll probably live lots, lots longer and see lots, lots more days. Right, Dad?
Bianca
	He's talkin' about when your mum and dad met,
	en't he?
Bianca
	I wonder how they fell in love.
	It's a shame we can't ask 'em.
Nera
	You wouldn't expect King Pankraz to get lost, would you? It must've been fate playing a hand.
Bianca
	Harry and Maria make a good couple, eh?
	They seem to get on really well.
Bianca
	We'd better not let 'em beat us in the happily married stakes. Come here and gimme a kiss!
Nera
	I suppose that'll be us now too, won't it?
	I mean, that's how we'll be, back at Gotha castle.
Nera
	It's a little bit hard to imagine at the moment,
	to be honest.
%0%a001250
	Prince Harry looks like a nice man.
	He's got kind eyes just like yours, Dad.
Bianca
	It's nice to have a good friend like that from way back. I'm a bit jealous, in fact.
Nera
	Young and beautiful!? You've got such nice friends, %a000090. I think I'll just block the ⓗblockⓘ part out!
%0%a001240
	Kendrick seems to be a really annoying, selfish brat, but he's alright underneath...I think.
%0%a001250
	It's Kendrick who should become %a001240's lackey, not the other way round!
Bianca
	The weather's amazin', en't it? Even the sky's smilin' down on us today.
%0%a001240
	Zenithia's way, way above the clouds, isn't it?
%0%a001240
	It's a bit hard to believe when you're down on
	the ground.
%0%a001250
	You know what I'd really like?
%0%a001250
	Once we get home to Gotha, I'd like us all to take a packed lunch and go for a picnic in the woods.
%0%a001230
	Alright, then. I'll make lunch for all of us.
%0%a001250
	Really? You will? Excellent!
Bianca
	I wonder how everyone'll react when we get back
	to Gotha.
Bianca
	We've not bin away all that long, and yet I sort of miss the place. Funny, en't it?
Nera
	I feel like I miss Gotha all of a sudden.
Nera
	I don't know why, really. It's not like I've been away for all that long.
%0%a001240
	King Wilbur's not like his brother Harry, is he?
	He seems really nice.
Bianca
	Hey! You mind your mouth! Imagine how Harry would feel if he heard you say that!
Bianca
	This en't our first time in Coburg, but the place feels pretty different today somehow.
Bianca
	It's probably all the folk laughin' away that's doin' it. The atmosphere's totally changed.
Nera
	Coburg Castle seems like a far brighter place now than it used to be. Just listen to all that laughter.
%0%a001240
	Wow! Everyone's heard about us!
	Everyone knows about what we've done.
%0%a001240
	Hey, you don't... You don't think they know about me wetting the bed lastⓚⓛ Oops! I mean... Nothing!
%0%a001250
	ⓗLegendary heroesⓘ!? What, we're all legendary heroes, are we?
%0%a001250
	Ha ha!
Bianca
	Hm? Did that soldier say somethin' just then?
	Sorry, I weren't listenin'.
%0%a001240
	But...it's not a dream. The world really is at peace!
Nera
	It still seems like a dream to me, even though
	I'm awake.
Nera
	No wonder this sleepy soldier can't quite believe it!
%0%a001240
	Nothing beats Gotha Castle, but this castle's really impressive too.
%0%a001250
	Isn't Dr Agon a god too? He's the Dragon God, isn't he? Does that mean he's married to the Goddess?
	Poor Goddess.
%0%a001240
	A slap-up meal? Do you think we can join in if we hang around here a bit longer?
%0%a001240
	But I suppose we've got to get back to Gotha, haven't we? Everyone'll be waiting for the great heroes to return!
%0%a001250
	Wow! She's not scared of the dark! I'm impressed!
Bianca
	That nun's so ecstatic, it's impossible to keep the smile off your face when you talk to her!
Bianca
	This is what it's all about, though. That's why
	we went to all that effort, so that folk could be happy again.
Nera
	I'm... I'm speechless! I don't think I've ever seen a nun so openly exuberant like that before!
%0%a001240
	Yay! Everyone's H-A-P-Y!
	I mean, H-A-P-P-Y!
%0%a001250
	I feel like dancing!
Bianca
	I can't believe it. I feel like I must be dreamin' or somethin'. The village is back to normal again!
Nera
	This is such a quaint little village.
	It's so nice to see it vibrant and alive again.
	You must be really happy, darling.
%0%a001240
	I know what this place is! I know what this place is! It's where you used to live when you were a boy, isn't it, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I think I'd like to live here too. It's got such a welcoming feel.
Bianca
	Folk certainly don't mess around, eh? The world's only bin at peace for a little while.
Bianca
	Maybe the Goddess give them a bit of a helpin' hand, by way of thankin' us or somethin'.
Nera
	I'm quite surprised the village has managed to recover so quickly.
Nera
	It must be the work of the Goddess. She's lent the people here a helping hand, I expect.
Bianca
	I'll bet your old man preferred livin' here to livin' at the castle in Gotha.
Bianca
	Don't you reckon? Everyone liked him here, and he had loads of really good friends.
%0%a001240
	He hit Grandpa on the head!? I'll show him!
%0%a001240
	When he's looking the other way, I'll give him a taste of his own medicine.
Bianca
	Watch it, %a001240! You should think before you speak sometimes.
%0%a001240
	He hit Grandpa on the head!? I'll show him!
%0%a001240
	When he's looking the other way, I'll give him a taste of his own medicine.
Nera
	Good idea, %a001240.
	I'll give him a thump as well!
%0%a001240
	N-No! I was only joking, Mum!
	That went right over your head, didn't it?
Nera
	Oh! I, er...
%0%a001250
	I bet he feels really silly now!
Bianca
	............
Bianca
	I'm feelin' quite relieved. It looks like lots of folk managed to escape to safety when it all went to pot.
Bianca
	Ha ha ha! Imagine what he'd say if he found out you're the King of Gotha now!
Nera
	Ha ha hah. What a jolly old man!
%0%a001240
	Grandpa fooled everyone here.
	No one had any idea he was a mighty king.
%0%a001240
	That's really cool!
%0%a001240
	I... I suppose we won't get attacked by monsters anywhere now, will we? Not outside towns, or in caves, even.
%0%a001240
	I can't really imagine it. I wonder what it's going to feel like.
Bianca
	Proud as Punch, eh? That's nice to hear, en't it?
%0%a001250
	I hope the people of Gotha will all be as proud as Punch of me one day. Although...what was Punch proud about?
Bianca
	So there are folk here who know you too, %a000090.
Bianca
	D'you get the feelin' that the Coburg soldiers let the villagers go before settin' fire to the place?
Bianca
	I could be wrong, but I reckon that's prob'ly
	what happened.
Nera
	It seems like plenty of people have come back here. Whealbrook's going to be fine, I should think.
Bianca
	What's up, %a000090? You looked a bit lost for a minute.
Nera
	What's the matter, darling? I've never seen such a look of relief on your face before.
%0%a001240
	Wow! He managed to eat all of that before his wife noticed what he was doing. That could be a really useful trick!
%0%a001250
	I'm a bit hungry, actually. I hope there'll be something to eat back in Gotha.
Bianca
	Hey! That's the bloke who was studyin' under the man who give us the medicine for Dad all them
	years ago.
Bianca
	It's good to see him back here safe and sound.
Nera
	I'm sure he'll make it.
Nera
	Anyone who refuses to give up on their dreams has the power to make them come true.
Bianca
	This place really takes me back.
	Remember, %a000090?
Bianca
	That time... No, it dun't matter. It's no use just harpin' on about the past all the while.
Nera
	This is the house that was built in place of yours, isn't it?
Nera
	I hope the people who live here now will be happy.
%0%a001240
	You lived here when you were little, didn't you, Dad? Not at the castle?
%0%a001240
	It's like you were a secret prince or something. That's cool!
%0%a001250
	Oh, I wanted to lounge around here for a while.
	I didn't think there'd be anyone living here now.
Bianca
	I don't know where he come from, but he dun't seem like a bad bloke.
Bianca
	Hopefully he'll take care of this place and keep it nice, eh?
%0%a001240
	Let's have his place as a holiday home, Dad!
Bianca
	Dun't be so rude, %a001240!
	There are other folk livin' here now.
%0%a001240
	Oops! Sorry!
%0%a001240
	Why don't we buy this place as a holiday home, Dad?
Nera
	So you'd like to swap it for your castle then, would you, %a001240?
%0%a001240
	I, er, not really...!
%0%a001240
	Mr Briscoletti seems really happy.
	Even happier than the time we defeated Bjørn.
%0%a001250
	Can I ask you something, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Mum seems really nervous coming here.
	Did something happen to her here in the past?
Bianca
	I wonder how Nera and Debora are gettin' on.
	We should drop in on 'em, %a000090.
Bianca
	It weren't just the boat he give us. He paid for our weddin' and everythin'.
Bianca
	I wonder if he's forgotten that bit.
%0%a001240
	We've been using the ship for ages, haven't we?
	Even after we found you again, Dad.
	It's been really useful.
Nera
	Papa really does look happy now.
Nera
	And he's a grandpapa now! That's a funny thought.
Nera
	I suppose I've been holding back slightly from Mama until now. It's probably made her feel a bit sad.
Nera
	But from now on, I think we'll have a proper mother-daughter relationship, with all the girly gossiping and quarrelling you'd expect!
Nera
	Papa's been so good to us. He let us use his ship, and gave us so many presents.
Nera
	We might not have been able to do it without his help, you know.
%0%a001240
	Mr Briscoletti's my grandpa too, isn't he?
	Because he's your dad, right, Mum?
Nera
	That's right, %a001240.
Bianca
	It feels like only yesterday that we were here
	gettin' wed.
Bianca
	Maybe it's all them years we spent as statues
	that makes it feel that way. Nah, I think it's more than that.
Nera
	I've never seen Mostroferrato so lively.
	I think I might join in the dancing!
%0%a001240
	Look at that! Every single person here's dancing.
	It's like a festival!
%0%a001250
	Are you pleased you married Mum, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I am. I think you're both great parents, so it's a good job you married each other.
%0%a001240
	La la-la-lah... La la-la-lah...
	La-di-dah-di-dah...
Bianca
	That girl's probably all excited about %a001240, you know. He is the legendary hero, after all.
Bianca
	So I don't know why you've got such a big smile on your face, %a000090!
%0%a001240
	Peace, man!
Bianca
	They look like they're havin' so much fun.
	Want to dance, %a000090?
%0%a001240
	Here comes my special move...
	The topsy-turvy bop!
%0%a001250
	Oh, I can't dance on my own!
	Will you dance with me, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I think that man was crying. He doesn't seem the type to be moved to tears though, does he?
%0%a001240
	He's not as old as can be yet. He can get loads older now the world's at peace!
Nera
	Bingo's happy too, look. He can probably tell everyone else is, that's why.
%0%a001240
	Did you see how quickly that man gulped down
	that glass? There won't be enough if he carries
	on like that!
%0%a001250
	That sounds like an excellent idea.
	I could get married too.
%0%a001250
	To a handsome slime!
Bianca
	Briscoletti's ever so generous, eh?
Bianca
	I reckon he's pretty canny when it comes to usin' his money, mind.
Nera
	It'd make Papa really happy if he saw everyone in town enjoying themselves in here.
Nera
	Isn't it wonderful, %a000090?
%0%a001240
	Wow. Do you think there'll be a feast as big as this when we get back to Gotha?
Bianca
	%0%a001240 and %a001250 could learn a thing or two from him, eh?
Nera
	I'm sure he'll have his own chance to enjoy the party. He'll be so happy to be able to play safely outside town now.
Bianca
	Crispin looks pretty pleased with himself, eh?
Bianca
	Men always like havin' somethin' or someone to look after. Makes 'em stronger, for some reason.
%0%a001250
	You competed for Nera's hand in marriage?
	You mean, you might have got married to Nera instead of Mum?
%0%a001250
	Is that true, Dad? Is that really true?
	What's he talking about?
Bianca
	Um, %a000090... D'you ever regret choosin' me that day instead of Nera?
Bianca
	I mean, she's so beautiful and graceful and...
Bianca
	Hey! Why en't you interruptin'!?
	Blimmin' charmed, I'm sure!
%0%a001240
	But aren't all years the same length?
Nera
	I hardly recognise Crispin now. He's so much more manly than he used to be.
Nera
	Maybe it's because he's finally found someone to look after and protect.
%0%a001250
	Did you have to compete with that man to marry Mum, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I'm glad you won. I wouldn't want anyone else as
	my parents.
Nera
	And she's turned Crispin into a fine, strong man too.
Nera
	Ashlee must be a wonderful woman. Full of spark!
%0%a001240
	What do you think of Ashlee's outfit, Dad?
	Do you like it?
%0%a001240
	Why don't you get something like that for Mum, then?
Nera
	............
%0%a001240
	Uh-oh! Mum looks really angry now.
%0%a001240
	Oh. I thought you did. You seemed to be looking at it a lot.
Bianca
	Huh! I can never tell with Dad if he's genuinely worried or if he's just takin' the mick.
Bianca
	Either way, I'm not plannin' on comin' back to live here, %a000090. Just as long as you know that.
%0%a001240
	Grandpa must be lonely here all on his own.
%0%a001240
	Why don't we ask him to come and live in Gotha once we're settled in there, Dad?
Bianca
	That's a nice idea, %a001240.
%0%a001250
	I love Grandpa Whitey. He's one of the nicest men I've ever met.
Bianca
	You're very sweet, %a001250.
Nera
	Now the world's a bit more stable, I'm sure there'll be lots of men who'd make a good match for Bianca, don't you think?
Nera
	I hope she finds someone she'll be really happy with.
Nera
	No? You think no one could measure up to you,
	do you? Ha ha hah! You old show-off!
%0%a001240
	Wow! Bianca's so pretty! Er...I mean...
%0%a001250
	What? You were no use, Dad? I don't believe that!
%0%a001240
	It's got nothing to do with being a king or anything though, has it? Friends are friends, right?
%0%a001240
	Let me come with you when you visit here,
	Dad, okay?
Nera
	We feel exactly the same way about Bianca.
	We've all got so much in common.
Nera
	It's almost as if she, Debora and I...
Nera
	No, forget it.
Bianca
	This place never changes, eh?
Bianca
	Knowin' that makes it easier to be away. I can be sure it'll be just the same whenever I come back.
Nera
	It's as quiet as ever here, but you can still tell that everyone's in a good mood.
%0%a001240
	It's okay to shout really loudly here, isn't it?
	Because we're miles away from anywhere, I mean.
%0%a001240
	HELLOOOOOOOO! Ah! That felt good!
Bianca
	I dunno! We go to all the trouble of savin' the world an' that's all he can say! Ungrateful old beggar!
Nera
	Ha ha ha. Well I know I'd like to come to the baths here from time to time. The waters are so relaxing.
Nera
	We should all come together. It'd be a nice
	family outing.
%0%a001240
	He's full of life isn't he! I hope I'm still going strong when I'm his age.
%0%a001250
	Great! I love baths!
Bianca
	That old bloke's always bin the same.
Bianca
	It's good that he's got a bit of life in him, but he does go a bit far sometimes.
Nera
	Well it's nice to see people staying young at heart, even when they're a bit ancient.
%0%a001240
	Everyone's prayers helped us to defeat Nimzo,
	I suppose, didn't they?
%0%a001240
	That's what that man must've meant when he said it's thanks to his boy.
Nera
	Well I didn't expect to find anyone in a place like this! Oh, I see. He works for Mr Whitaker, does he?
Bianca
	I'm sure he'll find someone nice before long.
%0%a001250
	Mum...
Bianca
	Hm? What's up, %a001250?
%0%a001250
	Oh, it's nothing. I just...
	I just wanted to say you're the best.
Bianca
	I'll never forget the look on your face when you brought me that veil, %a000090.
Bianca
	It was like everythin' goin' on around us was some kind of unbelievable dream.
Nera
	I still dream about you bringing me my veil sometimes, you know.
Nera
	Papa was so insistent about it, wasn't he?
%0%a001240
	It wasn't just me, though. It's because everyone pulled together. That's how we all saved the world.
%0%a001240
	It's not right just to say it was me who did everything. I don't want people to say that.
%0%a001250
	It seems like the whole world is on holiday today!
%0%a001240
	I wonder when all the troubles first started. Oh well, it doesn't matter now. The world's at peace, so we don't have to worry.
%0%a001240
	She's screeching so loudly, everyone can hear.
	It's so embarrassing!
%0%a001240
	Are they going to have a feast here as well, then? I'm starting to get really hungry now, you know.
Bianca
	D'you think that's really true? It'd be quite a shock if it was.
Bianca
	Nah, but there's no way it can be true.
Bianca
	There's no way Mum and Dad could've kept somethin' like that from me all them years.
Nera
	What? Bianca too?
Nera
	............
Bianca
	Wow! What a welcome home, eh?
Nera
	Oh look, darling! Everyone's gathered to welcome
	us home.
%0%a001240
	Everywhere we've been has been bustling, but nowhere else can compare to Gotha!
%0%a001250
	There's not a single person who isn't smiling.
	What a fantastic atmosphere! Although...it does
	smell a bit like a brewery.
Bianca
	Yeah, you can't run away, %a000090. I know this is all a bit embarrassin', but you've got to show your face.
Nera
	Aren't you the shy one? Fancy trying to slope off at a time like this!
%0%a001240
	Tuppence! I can go and see him again later, can't I?
%0%a001240
	What's wrong with grown-ups!? Every time something happens to celebrate, they start
	talking funny.
%0%a001250
	Urgh! What a stink!
Bianca
	Patty's bin a big help to us, eh? We'll have to make sure we thank her prop'ly sometime.
Nera
	I suppose there'll be no more party planning now, will there? That's a bit sad.
Bianca
	Yeah, I reckon you could be. We'll make Gotha better than Pankraz ever dreamt.
Bianca
	No rest for the wicked, eh, %a000090?
Nera
	That's quite a compliment, isn't it, darling?
	But it's well deserved. You've worked so hard to bring about peace.
%0%a001240
	I've got a lot to live up to, haven't I?
%0%a001250
	That old man's always been in bed whenever
	I've seen him before. It's great that he's up and about now.
%0%a001240
	ⓗ%0%a001240 was too strongⓘ...
	Heh heh heh! Cool! It sounds better when someone else says it, though.
%0%a001250
	The foe sat on a swan... No, that's not right.
	Oh, it's a really hard poem to remember.
Bianca
	%0%a001210's bin a big help to us, an' all, eh?
Nera
	Look! %0%a001210 looks so calm now.
Bianca
	Did you hear that? Did you hear what he said?
Bianca
	If you didn't, then you should go and talk to
	him again!
Nera
	Listen to him! Oh dear. Am I blushing?
%0%a001240
	Finally! We can actually join in and eat the food this time, right, Dad? We can, can't we?
Bianca
	I can understand how he feels, but we needed folk like him to stay here and protect this place, eh?
Nera
	It's so nice to know we had everyone's support,
	isn't it?
%0%a001240
	Hurray! Hip-hip, hurray!
	Come on, %a001250, join in!
%0%a001250
	Okay! Hurray! Yay! Hip-hip, hurray!
Bianca
	Hopefully monsters and humans should all be able to live together in peace from now on.
Nera
	It's heartening to know that even some monsters helped us out in our hour of need, isn't it?
Nera
	If they're ever in trouble, it'll be our turn to
	help them.
%0%a001250
	Look! The slime's as happy as everyone else.
%0%a001240
	Does that mean we won't be able to see Zenithia any more when we look up in the sky? Oh...
	That's a shame.
Bianca
	Was that funny character really the Zenith Dragon? I've never met him before.
Bianca
	Now I can see why the Zenithians were in such
	a flap.
Nera
	That's Dr Agon? Ha ha hah. What a funny man!
%0%a001240
	Oh, no! Dr Agon's done-diddly-un it again!
%0%a001240
	How's he going to get back to Zenithia?
	He'll be stuck here now, just like he was in the Diggery Pokery!
%0%a001250
	I think maybe Dr Agon wishes he'd been born
	a human.
Bianca
	Looks like he en't budgin' out the way any time soon.
Bianca
	We'll just have to turn back. You don't want to mess with a bloke in his state.
%0%a001240
	Okay, I get that he's happy, but we want to get past.
%0%a001250
	Thank you, little beast. We couldn't have done it without you. You're a good boy, aren't you?
	Yes. Good boy, good boy.
%0%a001240
	Ha ha! A shy monster! Your monsters are all so
	cute, Dad!
Bianca
	Yeah, we'd better hurry up and get to the
	throne room.
Bianca
	Or would you rather have a bit more of a chat with folk first? I'm easy either way.
Nera
	We can't keep everyone waiting any longer than we have already. Come on, darling.
Bianca
	Well, now the world's at peace again, it should be easy to come and go between here and Zenithia.
Nera
	She'll finally be able to go freely back and forth between here and Zenithia now. What a relief that must be for her.
%0%a001240
	I bet she'd be surprised if she knew the Zenith Dragon was right here in Gotha!
%0%a001250
	Is she going to leave Gotha now?
	I was sort of hoping she might decide to stay.
Bianca
	Um, %a000090...
Bianca
	There's not a day goes by when I don't send up a prayer of thanks to the Goddess for havin' met you.
Bianca
	I hope we'll be together forever. Don't ever leave me, will you, %a000090?
Nera
	I don't know if it's seeing everyone's happy faces or what, but I feel like I'm wrapped up in a warm blanket of joy.
Nera
	And just think, if I hadn't met you, I'd never have experienced this wonderful feeling.
Nera
	I love you, darling. Now and for always.
%0%a001240
	Cousin Gertie seems a bit serious today, doesn't she?
%0%a001250
	I can't wait to tell Gertie all about everything that's happened!
Bianca
	We'd better get movin', %a000090.
Nera
	This marks the real end of our quest, I suppose.
%0%a001240
	There he goes again! Blubbing like a baby as usual!
%0%a001250
	Grandpa's watching over us all now.
	He's watching over Sancho too.
Debora
	Time to go! People all over the world are waiting for our return.
Debora
	So my beauty will be recorded for all to see until the end of time!
Debora
	What an opportunity, being able to look down on the world from the back of the Zenith Dragon!
	It's no less than we deserve, of course.
Debora
	She's right. You can hear them all down there hailing my greatness.
Debora
	...What's wrong? There's no need to look so put-out.
	I know you played your part in it too. 
	Surely that's recognition enough.
Debora
	Hmm... Forever?
Debora
	The idea of us being together forever is quite appealing too. No doubt you're thrilled?
Debora
	It means you'll have to dedicate yourself to me until the end of time, of course. And that's an order.
Nera
	I couldn't have said it better myself. We may have done great things, but they were all thanks to the guidance of the Goddess.
Debora
	Nobody guides me but myself! The things I've accomplished are all my own doing.
Debora
	It's an incredible view. I'm sure your mother and father are looking out on it too.
Debora
	Your mother remained strong right up to the end.
	I think she's the first person I've ever met who I genuinely admire.
Debora
	I'm going to use her as a role model from now on and become stronger than ever. I won't be beaten!
Debora
	Your mother was really happy to have met your father, wasn't she? Just like you were happy to have met me.
Debora
	You can tell the world's at peace again.
	You can see it in people's faces.
Debora
	I hardly think that the battle with Nimzo can be described as romantic!
Debora
	Yes, maybe I should say a few prayers too. I can't bear the idea of having to go through all that again.
Debora
	Talking of home, I wonder where it is I'm really from. And Nera too, of course.
Debora
	Not that it really matters any more.
	You and the children are my family now.
Nera
	I'm convinced that our victory was only possible because people all over the world believed in us and prayed for us.
Debora
	He actually seems to get it. The reason we managed it is because of our own strength and that alone. Nothing to do with prayers or luck.
Debora
	It's funny how the littlest of things can spiral into something huge. Much like how we ended up
	being married.
Debora
	That's right. I am too good for you, aren't I, %a000090?
Debora
	Right, %a000090? I know you're a bit slow, but even you must've figured that out.
Debora
	You two get along so well. It should be wonderful for relations between Gotha and Coburg.
Debora
	You'll have to think about things like that from now on, you know. Naturally they'll be lower down your priorities than I am, though.
Debora
	I suddenly feel a bit of a pang for Gotha.
Debora
	It's strange, really. I mean, it's just the place you were born.
Debora
	There's a lot more life to the place than there used to be. I suppose it stands to reason, what with the world being at peace now.
Debora
	Hmph. If he'd helped us, then he could've been sharing the glory too. But maybe that's a little unfair.
Debora
	I don't need to hear the ramblings of someone having a dream. Imagine his shock when he wakes up and finds the world really is at peace!
Debora
	Happy! Happy! Hapⓚⓛ
	Er, I'm not getting carried away. No, not in the slightest. ...What are you laughing at?
Debora
	So this is how your old village should look. You must be pleased to see it back to normal, %a000090.
Debora
	Yes, it's thanks to our efforts for peace that Whealbrook has recovered so well.
Debora
	No doubt having a wonderful wife like me is what motivated you to give your best.
%0%a001240
	He hit Grandpa on the head!? I'll show him!
%0%a001240
	When he's looking the other way, I'll give him a taste of his own medicine.
Debora
	Good idea, %a001240.
	I'll give him a whack as well!
%0%a001240
	N-No! I was only joking, Mum!
	You almost sounded like you meant it.
Debora
	What makes you think I didn't?
%0%a001240
	Yikes!
%0%a001250
	Yikes indeed!
Debora
	Looks like he doesn't recognise you as being Pankraz's son.
Debora
	We'd better not let on.
	The shock might finish him off.
Debora
	It must be good to see a friend safe and sound, %a000090.
Debora
	Maybe the soldiers from Coburg set everyone free before torching the place.
Debora
	So perhaps it wasn't as bad as it seemed after all.
Debora
	What's wrong? You look like a fish out of water!
Debora
	This place is on the mend. Now they have a pharmacist and everything. I'm not sure how
	good he is, mind.
Debora
	Hmm, this isn't a bad little place. It's probably good that it was torched and rebuilt.
Debora
	Maybe this'll help you look to the future a bit, %a000090.
%0%a001240
	I like this place, Dad.
	Let's buy it as a holiday home!
Debora
	Don't be so silly! Money can't buy everything, you know. I wonder who you take after sometimes!
%0%a001240
	Well, Mum, to be honest, er...
	Never mind.
Debora
	Sounds like Papa's behind all this frivolity.
	He's always doing things like this!
Debora
	Still, I suppose I can turn a blind eye just this once.
Debora
	What a good boy. Maybe we'll have to hire him as one of our royal staff when he grows up.
Debora
	How embarrassing! Papa's heart is almost as soft as his belly!
Debora
	It's sweet that he feels that way, but I wish he'd keep a bit of a lid on it.
Debora
	I'm sure Mama's been worried about this for years. Maybe that's why she always let me get away with behaving however I wanted.
Debora
	I'll have to try and tone it down a little bit from now on. ...What do you mean, that's not like me?
Debora
	How dare you say such a thing!
	Er, I mean... Lovely, yes.
Debora
	Papa can be so embarrassing sometimes!
	What he needs is a giant lasagne to shut him up.
%0%a001240
	Mr Briscoletti's my grandpa too, isn't he?
	Because he's your dad, right, Mum?
Debora
	That's right, %a001240. And he spoils me something rotten! I'm sure you could wrap him round your little finger as well.
Bianca
	Debora en't changed a bit, eh?
	It's good to see her well, anyhow.
%0%a001240
	ⓗThe likes of youⓘ?
	What does that mean, Dad?
%0%a001250
	That lady always seems so...scary!
Nera
	I feared as much. Debora...
Nera
	............
%0%a001250
	What's wrong, Mum?
	You look upset.
Nera
	Nothing's wrong, %a001250.
	I'm just so happy, that's all.
%0%a001240
	ⓗThe likes of youⓘ? What does that mean?
	Is she saying she likes you or something?
%0%a001250
	I thought maybe I was imagining it, but now I'm sure. Deep down, she's just like Mum.
Debora
	The whole town's celebrating!
	They're making quite a noise about it too,
	but I suppose I'll let them off just this once.
Nera
	She's embarrassed? Not nearly as embarrassed as I am to be spoken to like that!
Debora
	Oh my, indeed! It stands to reason %a001240's legendary. He's my son after all.
Debora
	He seems very excited. Maybe he can sense that everyone's in a good mood.
Debora
	Same old Crispin. He's always been that way, ever since he was little. Always getting carried away.
Debora
	Still, if it doesn't bother Nera, then who am I
	to judge?
%0%a001250
	You competed for Nera's hand in marriage?
	You mean, you might have got married to Nera instead of Mum?
%0%a001250
	I can't imagine that at all! She's so different toⓚⓛ Er, nothing, Mum. 
Debora
	I know it's a bit late to say this now, but...
Debora
	If you'd chosen Nera, I wouldn't have had to end up being related to Crispin!
Debora
	Oh well. As long as she's happy, I suppose.
%0%a001240
	But aren't all years the same length?
Debora
	Bianca seems well.
	You must be relieved.
Debora
	I'm quite relieved too.
	I feel connected to Bianca somehow.
Debora
	Maybe because we've both had to put up with you over the years.
Debora
	Hmph. If you're still worried about her, then why don't you just take her back on home to Gotha?
Debora
	Ha ha! I'm not really angry, don't worry.
	And I don't mind you coming back every now and then to check she's okay. With me along, of course.
%0%a001240
	Wow! Bianca's so pretty! Er...I mean...
%0%a001250
	What? You were no use, Dad? I don't believe that!
%0%a001240
	It's got nothing to do with being a king or anything though, has it? Friends are friends, right?
%0%a001240
	Let me come with you when you visit here,
	Dad, okay?
Debora
	So Bianca feels it too.
	Nera and I have said the same thing.
Debora
	It's almost as if we all met once, a long long time ago.
Debora
	We're probably just imagining it, though.
Debora
	There's nothing here but the baths, just like always. There's a cheerful air to the place, though.
Debora
	What a silly old man. He wouldn't last five minutes in a fight at his age.
Debora
	If you turn out like him, %a000090, I'll never forgive you.
Debora
	You'll settle down and become a nice, obedient, docile old man. Or else!
Debora
	Hmm... So he's doing work on Bianca's place, is he?
	Ha ha! I see!
Debora
	I still haven't forgotten the look on your face when you brought me that veil.
Debora
	It was as if you thought everything going on around you must be some kind of dream.
Debora
	Not Bianca too?
Debora
	...............
Debora
	Our people have obviously been dying to see our homecoming. Just look at them all!
Debora
	Where do you think you're off to at a time like this? I'm not going anywhere!
Debora
	We won't be setting off on any more adventures from here again. I feel a little bit sad in a way.
Debora
	You are great, %a000090. I've always known it.
	I wouldn't have hired you as my servant otherwise.
Debora
	You'll have to work hard now to be a an even finer king than your father was. I know you'll manage it, because you want to keep me happy.
Debora
	%0%a001210 looks really happy.
	I suppose he played his part too.
Debora
	If I had a gold coin for every time someone called
	me beautiful!
Debora
	That wasn't the most eloquent version of it I've heard, but it still counts nonetheless.
Debora
	Do you ever think it might've been better to just take a royal army along to defeat Nimzo?
Debora
	You fool! We'd never have all fitted through the entrance to Nadiria!
Debora
	Quite a few monsters helped us out, didn't they?
	I don't mind having the nice ones live alongside us here in Gotha.
Debora
	Don't talk to me at the moment.
	I need to think.
Debora
	That man's Dr Agon... And Dr Agon is the Zenith Dragon! Ha ha! I don't believe it!
Nera
	Oh dear, he seems rather drunk. I'm afraid we probably won't be able to persuade him to make
	way for us.
Debora
	Why are drunks always so irritating? I know he's happy, but can't he just get out of my way?
Debora
	We have been a while. We'd better make our way to the throne room now, %a000090.
Debora
	I suppose she can go home to Zenithia now it's been restored to its former glory. She won't find the Zenith Dragon there, though!
Debora
	This is perfect, %a000090.
Debora
	I couldn't be any happier.
Debora
	It's such a wonderful feeling to be adored by everyone like this.
Debora
	He cries at the drop of a hat, that one!
	I suppose it's quite sweet in a way.
Debora
	Anyway, it's time to go. You'd better follow me.
	You don't want to be late.
%0%a001250
	I'm so happy that the people here are thanking Grandpa at last.
Debora
	I'm pleased too, %a001250.
	It's nice to see you so happy.
