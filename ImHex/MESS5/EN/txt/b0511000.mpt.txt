Tuppence
	Waaah! Ghosts!
Bianca
	The Order of Zugzwang!? Then they must've bin at the temple that time. I hope they're alright.
Nera
	I'm sorry, darling. I'm just finding it hard to have a conversation with a ghost.
%0%a001240
	It's not our fault. It was already in a bad state when we found it.
%0%a001250
	Is there no way we can make the tea set all nice again for him, Dad?
Sancho
	There was a f-fine tea set een Gotha a l-long, long t-t-time ago.
Sancho
	I n-no remember what h-happened to eet now.
	Maybe esomeone, they br-broke eet? Si...
	M-Maybe eet was djour cl-clumsy Uncle S-Sancho...
Tuppence
	Waaah! Ghosts!
Bianca
	The Order of Zugzwang!? Then they must've bin at the temple that time. I hope they're alright.
Nera
	I'm sorry, darling. I'm just finding it hard to have a conversation with a ghost.
%0%a001240
	I'm not scared of ghosts if they're all like him!
%0%a001250
	The Count wants us to help him. What's this tea set he's on about, though? Do you think it's here in the castle somewhere?
Sancho
	Uf. Thees c-count, hees esoul can n-no rest, eh?
Tuppence
	Waaah! Ghosts!
Bianca
	Do you think it's really okay for us to get hold of a crown like this? I dun't feel worthy!
Nera
	A p-p-present from a ghost. How l-lovely...
%0%a001240
	(sniff sniff)
%0%a001240
	It's okay! I was thinking it might be a bit stinky because it's so old, but it's actually not too bad.
%0%a001250
	Don't give that crown to me, will you? I'm worried
	I'll stop growing if I wear something too heavy on
	my head .
Sancho
	Uf! Ees a f-fine article, eh, chico?
	Djou m-must look after eet, okay?
Tuppence
	Waaah! Ghosts!
Bianca
	It's funny seein' the flash of light when he's angry
	at you sayin' no! Takes me back to the last time we met him!
%0%a001240
	Did the Count make that flash of light? It's a bit
	mean of him to do that just because he didn't like
	our answer.
%0%a001250
	That tea set used to belong here in the castle, right? But now it's got into a bad way.
%0%a001250
	I thought you were supposed to keep precious things like that safe, though. Don't all adults know that?
Tuppence
	Waaah! Ghosts!
Bianca
	Well, we can hardly accept responsibility for that now, can we?
Nera
	What a shame they've been disappointed!
%0%a001240
	It must be a bit rubbish being dead. I'll have to be careful it doesn't happen to me.
%0%a001250
	Don't the Count and Countess need to go and be
	with the Goddess? Or are they just going to stay here forever?
Tuppence
	You can't taste anything when you're dead? How tiresome! I'll have to make sure I eat and drink as many delicious things as I can while I'm alive, then.
Bianca
	Fancy comin' back here! Dun't you worry, though.
Bianca
	I still en't forgotten how good it was to come explorin' here with you when we were kids.
Nera
	If there was a castle like this near Mostroferrato, I know I would've had to explore it when I was little.
Nera
	Oops! I'd better not let the children hear me say things like that.
%0%a001240
	Do you know this place, Dad? That's cool! Maybe I should go off adventuring of a night, too!
Bianca
	Oi! I dun't think so! Your dad and I only came here adventurin' for good reason, I'll have you know.
%0%a001240
	Huh!
%0%a001250
	I can hear the little birds singing. They're saying that all is well here at the castle now.
Sancho
	I n-no believe djou and Bianca, djou w-went out of the town alone like thees all those djears ago, chico.
Sancho
	But ees okay. Ees n-no esomething to be a-angry about now. Ees t-too long ago. And djou are n-no the muchacho djou were then.
Sancho
	I n-never came to thees place weeth señor Pankraz. I believed ees j-just an old ruin.
Tuppence
	Are there ghosts here?
Tuppence
	I suppose I'd consider a beautiful female ghost if I had to. You can't accuse me of being closed-minded.
Bianca
	I reckon it was the bad ghosts that made it so scary last time. Walkin' around now, even of a night, dun't scare me at all.
Nera
	You and Bianca came adventuring here in the middle of the night once, didn't you? I wish I'd been there.
%0%a001240
	I reckon %a001250 and I are big and brave enough to explore somewhere like this on our own!
%0%a001250
	When you were here as a boy, there were lots of evil ghosts, weren't there? How scary!
Sancho
	Djou and Bianca, djou c-came here to thees place een the m-m-middle of the night, si? When djou were j-just a leettle muchacho.
Sancho
	Djou know, I b-believed djou were a well-behaved djoung boy, but no. Djou are tr-truly the eson of señor Pankraz. I, I am eso h-h-happy!
Tuppence
	Brrr... There's a bit of a chill in the air here. Oh...
	I'm the only one feeling it, am I?
Bianca
	I can't sense anything sinister here now.
	That's a relief.
%0%a001240
	It'd be really fun to come exploring here just with kids of my own age.
Bianca
	The place looks a bit tidier than the last time
	we came, eh? Maybe those two lovebirds
	fixed it up a bit.
Bianca
	We did a good job of rescuin' %a001210 by comin' here all those years back. I couldn't have done it without you, %a000090.
Nera
	Old buildings always have a certain smell to them. Maybe it's just mould, I don't know. But it's not a
	bad smell.
Nera
	I can't imagine how worried I'd be at the thought of %a001240 and %a001250 here all alone.
Nera
	You'd be worried too, right? That's probably just how Pankraz felt when you came here as a boy.
%0%a001240
	Are all the bad ghosts gone now? If I see any, I'll soon send them packing!
%0%a001240
	Look! There's a huge spider's web up there. Wow!
	It looks amazing.
%0%a001240
	We don't have any ghosts in Gotha.
	It would be fun if we did.
%0%a001240
	I reckon I could stay undiscovered here for ages if we had a game of hide-and-seek.
%0%a001250
	This castle's not scary. Not now all the nasty ghosts have gone away.
%0%a001250
	There are so many stairs and corridors here.
	I'm worried I'm going to get lost.
%0%a001250
	You did well here, Dad. The people seem really grateful to you.
%0%a001250
	My favourite castle of all is Gotha, of course. That's where all my friends are. And it's much warmer than here, too.
Sancho
	Djou no think ees a r-really beeg castle?
	Ees like a g-giant paella. Ees a w-waste
	to leave eet.
Sancho
	To restore thees c-c-castle to eets f-former glory, ees gonna take muchos, muchos time, eh?
	Si. Many, many djears.
Tuppence
	Tuppence Castle... No, not grand enough. Great Tuppence Castle? Hmm... I know! I could call it Tupptaten Towers!
Tuppence
	Sorry! I was just trying to figure out what name I'll give my castle in the future.
Tuppence
	Watch where you're walking, won't you, %a000090? The floorboards might be a bit weak in places.
%0%a001240
	It's funny to find a house hidden in the woods
	like this.
%0%a001240
	Wow! Did you hear that, Dad?
	You can get to the Realm of the Faeries from here!
%0%a001240
	You spent some time with a faerie once, didn't you, Dad? That means you must be able to see them!
Sancho
	Uf! Now ees a f-forest we g-get lost een?
	Thees quest, ees n-no easy, eh?
Tuppence
	So if I can find my way through this forest, that'll prove that I'm someone special. Right then!
%0%a001240
	Ha ha! We've already been to the
	Realm of the Faeries!
Sancho
	I hope ees n-no eso hard to g-g-go there thees time.
%0%a001250
	I saw a funny shadow just then.
	You don't think...?
Tuppence
	It's funny how she remembers being a little girl.
	I don't remember being a little boy. I suppose I must've been in Gotha.
%0%a001250
	Does that mean you can't see faeries any more
	when you grow up? If that's true, I never want to grow up!
%0%a001240
	This forest goes on forever! It'd be a never-ending job looking after all these trees.
%0%a001240
	Hang on! Which way did we come from again?
	Can you remember, Dad?
%0%a001240
	You've met a faerie before, right, Dad? What was she like? Was she taller than me?
%0%a001240
	And could she fly? Did she have wings? Do you think she'd be my friend? Tell me everything!
%0%a001250
	The trees here in the forest are saying that they never let bad people through, but we're good, right?
%0%a001250
	My hair ribbon's come undone again. It keeps getting caught on the branches of the trees.
%0%a001250
	Look! Over there!
	...Oh. It's disappeared.
Sancho
	M-Maybe ees gonna take a l-long time to get
	out of thees f-forest, no? Now I weesh I p-pack
	the c-c-cold paella.
Sancho
	Djou know, once señor P-Pankraz, he eshow me the way to g-get out of the maze. But ees n-no gonna work here, I think.
Sancho
	Ees m-muchos dangerous eef djou r-r-run
	around weeth n-no purpose. Djou must t-take
	eet eslow now.
Tuppence
	My life of brilliance is about to start right here! You have to guide us through this forest, %a000090!
Tuppence
	That's odd. This path looks rather familiar.
	I do hope you're concentrating, %a000090!
%0%a001240
	I've heard about the Realm of the Faeries from Sancho. Do you know much about it, Dad?
%0%a001240
	I don't know what Mum looks like, but I'll bet she's even more beautiful than the Faerie Queen!
%0%a001250
	I'd really love to live in the Realm of the Faeries.
%0%a001250
	Is there a land for faeries and a land for monsters?
	Um, which one do you think this is?
%0%a001250
	Um, is it okay if we go and play in the Realm of the Faeries again soon, Dad?
Sancho
	We n-no have anything to do here in the forest, eh, chico? We leave now, okay?
Sancho
	Djou must n-no lose thees f-faerie horn, okay?
Sancho
	Esometimes djou have the c-careless moment, eh, chico? Ees true, si?
Tuppence
	Treacle was quite a beauty. I should imagine the Faerie Queen must be exquisite.
Tuppence
	Imagine how envious people would be if one married a faerie. Yes, what an idea! A faerie bride...
%0%a001240
	I reckon I know all the paths through here now.
	How about you, Dad?
%0%a001240
	It's okay. I know we have to keep the thing with the gold bauble a secret from the faeries.
%0%a001240
	They've all been such a big help to us. We'd better make sure we do our best.
%0%a001250
	Do you think that I'll still be able to see faeries when I grow up if I make sure I behave myself and I'm good all the time?
Sancho
	Eef ees p-possible to t-turn back time, ees...
Sancho
	No. Ees n-no important.
	Come. We go, okay?
Bianca
	This is a pretty dense forest, eh? You can hardly see the sky at all.
Bianca
	Ouch! I've got a crick in my neck from lookin' up
	so much!
Nera
	The air smells so fresh inside a forest. I wonder how far this one stretches on for.
Nera
	So only the children could see the faerie the first time you were here? How interesting!
%0%a001240
	Over by the bonfire, Dad!
	We should go and have a look.
%0%a001250
	I saw her! I just saw a faerie over there by the bonfire! Can we go and talk to her?
Sancho
	Ees esome kind of g-game?
	Si. I remember djou like to p-play like thees when djou are djoung, chico.
Tuppence
	Yes, I, er, I saw it, too! Over by the bonfire...
	Er, it was a huge bearded man!
Tuppence
	Yes, with six legs...and, er, four ears... Um, no, maybe it was two legs... Anyway, there's something there!
Sancho
	Eh!? Ees n-no one there, b-but...
	Djou n-no hear a voice?
Sancho
	My Majesty! Run! R-Run away before djou
	are k-k-keelled!
Tuppence
	Hm? Did I hear a voice then, or am I just
	imagining things?
%0%a001240
	Did you see her that time, Dad?
	She made it so adults can see her, too.
%0%a001250
	Are we going to Faerie Lea again?
	I love it there!
Tuppence
	You can see her, can't you, %a000090? It doesn't make sense! Why can't I? It's not fair!
Bianca
	You had a little bit of an adventure with a faerie when you were a kid, din't you?
Bianca
	You've certainly got your fair share of tales to
	tell, eh?
Nera
	I saw her, too! I saw the faerie! She looks just like the faeries I saw all those years ago.
%0%a001240
	So is it different to the time you came before,
	or hasn't it changed much?
%0%a001240
	Oh. There used to be more faeries about?
	I wonder where they've all gone, then.
%0%a001240
	There only seem to be girl faeries.
	I feel like a bit of an intruder.
%0%a001250
	The faeries and the monsters all get along fine together here. That's the way it should be.
%0%a001250
	Is it always spring here? I'm sure that's not the
	only reason for the place having such a warm
	feel to it, though.
Sancho
	Uf! I always know thees qu-quest of djours, eet ees hard, b-but I n-no think ees eso hard djou must
	tr-travel to the R-Realm of the Faeries.
Sancho
	But djou know, ees n-no eso bad here, eh?
	Ees a v-very b-b-beautiful place.
Bianca
	It was the depths of winter when you came here as a boy, eh, %a000090? It's hard to imagine it now.
Bianca
	Thanks for bringin' me here.
	I always wanted to see the Realm of the Faeries.
Nera
	This place looks exactly like a picture I saw in a book once when I was a child.
Nera
	%0%a001250 seems to really like books. I'll have to find it and read it to her one day.
Nera
	Thank you, darling. I was just thinking how I'd love to visit the Realm of the Faeries.
Bianca
	Dwarfs make all kinds of things, eh? They're pretty impressive creatures by all accounts.
%0%a001250
	That slime looked really cute, don't you think?
%0%a001250
	I knew you'd agree, Dad!
	You see things like that.
%0%a001250
	Oh. You think all slimes look the same?
	That's weird.
Bianca
	It's funny to think that you came to a place like this all them years ago. I wish I could've come with you.
%0%a001240
	So you really did used to be a little boy.
	Does that mean Sancho was small once, too?
Sancho
	Eh, chico! I n-no tell djou then that djou must
	st-stay eenside the town? But djou c-come eso
	far away to thees p-place.
Sancho
	Qué? Djou c-come here from eenside our house!?
%0%a001240
	Is Treacle a friend of yours, Dad?
	I'd like to meet her if she is.
Tuppence
	Aah. Faeries really are rather sweet, aren't they?
Tuppence
	Aah. All of these faeries are just so
	incredibly sweet!
%0%a001240
	So she wasn't the queen, then?
%0%a001240
	So when we blow this horn, we get to meet the Queen? Will you let me blow it, Dad? Pleeease!
%0%a001250
	There are so many faeries here! Do you think I might be able to make friends with some of them?
%0%a001250
	Ooh, what a pretty horn! Is it some kind of musical instrument? I wonder what kind of music it plays.
Sancho
	Ees all c-connected, si? Djou help esomeone e-een the past, and now they h-help djou.
%0%a001240
	Did you hear that!? So there really is a Zenithian castle out there somewhere! We have to find it, Dad!
%0%a001250
	I'm not very good when it comes to heights. I should be okay in the castle, but I'm not too sure about the stairway...
Sancho
	Thees señorita ees eso djoung, but she r-rules thees place eso well.
Tuppence
	Mmm... Treacle. She really is terribly sweet.
%0%a001240
	Treacle's got such a lovely smile, and she's so friendly. I wonder if Mum's like her.
%0%a001240
	When you get the chance, will you tell me all
	about what happened here in the past? I really
	want to know!
%0%a001250
	Treacle's clothes are so beautiful. If only I could try on some clothes like that.
Sancho
	Thees señorita ees eso djoung, but she r-rules thees place eso well.
Sancho
	My Majesty, we no have anything m-more to do here, no? Ees time to leave?
Tuppence
	Mmm... Treacle. She really is terribly sweet.
Bianca
	D'you think you're really supposed to climb up into the heavens to get to Zenithia?
Bianca
	I think it looks quite good floatin' about in the middle of the sky like it is at the minute, personally.
Nera
	It looks like we were wrong about peace being restored to the world just by the Zenith Dragon being resurrected.
%0%a001240
	Everybody wants peace, don't they? I'll do my best, as long as you stick by me, Dad.
%0%a001250
	Peace doesn't mean a world without monsters, right? Peace will be when we can all live together
	in harmony.
Sancho
	Anda! Everyone, they esay n-nothing but p-peace, peace, peace. But ees n-no easy to find the peace, djou know? 
Tuppence
	So the lovely Treacle is praying, too! Ooh, I feel better already! I'm raring to go now!
%0%a001250
	I'm going to make friends with some faeries
	just like you have, Dad. And one day, we'll all
	go off adventuring together.
Sancho
	Ees amazing... Djou r-really c-came here when djou were eso djoung, eh, chico?
Sancho
	Djour father, señor Pankraz, he w-was also the escape artist when he was djoung, but ees
	n-nothing compared to djou!
Tuppence
	Your Majesty! You absolutely must introduce me to that delightful creature!
%0%a001240
	Was Honey a bit more chatty the last time you met her, Dad?
%0%a001240
	I'll bet she's being quiet now to show respect
	to Treacle.
%0%a001250
	Treacle... Honey... Sherbet...
	Faeries' names are all so sweet, don't you think?
Bianca
	There are all sorts of odd places dotted about the world, eh?
Nera
	You look a bit disappointed, darling. Was your last adventure with Honey really that much fun?
%0%a001240
	Do you think all of the faeries obey what the Queen says? If it were me, I'd probably sneak off there when no one was looking.
%0%a001250
	That's good, Dad. It's nice that Honey has good memories of your adventure together, too.
%0%a001240
	Just the idea of staying the night in the Realm of the Faeries is really exciting!
%0%a001250
	We'd probably all have lovely dreams if we stayed the night here, don't you think, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I wish I could live in a room like this.
Bianca
	What's goin' on with that wall? The more times I look at it, the more odd it seems.
Nera
	We're inside a tree, and yet it's like being in the water. Just what you'd expect from a faerie's home, I suppose! Full of illusions.
%0%a001250
	The walls and the stairs are all watery!
	Faeries are so amazing!
%0%a001240
	The Faerie Palace is pretty deep into the woods,
	isn't it?
%0%a001250
	I really like being out in nature, with trees and water all around. It just makes me feel good.
Sancho
	Djou are l-like djour father, si? Djou n-no have the sense of rheethm and djou n-no can sing, si?
Sancho
	But thees horn, ees m-made by the faeries.
	Ees okay. Anyone, they can make eet work.
%0%a001240
	Everybody wants peace, don't they? I'll do my best, as long as you stick by me, Dad.
%0%a001250
	Peace doesn't mean a world without monsters, right? Peace will be when we can all live together
	in harmony.
Sancho
	Anda! Everyone, they esay n-nothing but p-peace, peace, peace. But ees n-no easy to find the peace, djou know? 
Bianca
	Where d'you think the feather came from?
	I didn't think faeries had wings.
Nera
	So faerie quills really do exist! I always thought they were just made up in books.
%0%a001240
	Hey, that's pretty cool. I reckon I might even be able to knuckle down and study if I had something like this to write with!
%0%a001250
	I can spell some really difficult words, you know,
	so you could let me use that quill sometime if
	you wanted.
Tuppence
	This must've been made by pulling a feather out of some poor creature's back. Dear me!
Bianca
	I get it. You have to use the quill with the right kind of ink, then.
%0%a001240
	Oh! I can't wait to have a go at using this quill!
%0%a001250
	Um, Dad, it might be better not to let %a001240 use the quill, you know.
%0%a001250
	It's just, he's always breaking normal pens, and they're much stronger. I don't know how he does it!
Bianca
	The walls and the stairs feel all watery, and
	yet you dun't get wet when you touch 'em.
	It's all very weird.
%0%a001250
	There's water everywhere, but it doesn't feel cold.
	I suppose that's because it's spring water. I mean, water in the spring!
Sancho
	I n-never get used to thees f-f-floating estairs.
	The estairs, they must be firm, djou know.
	Si. V-Very, very firm.
%0%a001240
	You know Dwight and that slime, don't you, Dad? Sometimes it feels like you know everyone in the whole world!
%0%a001250
	I wouldn't mind living in a cave if I had a slime to keep me company. ...But maybe it's not such a 
	good idea.
Tuppence
	So this Dwight character killed his grandfather?
	No? Barking up the wrong tree, am I?
Tuppence
	It amounts to the same thing, as far as I can see.
Bianca
	That's got me thinkin'. I wonder if Mum died because someone made her worry too much...
%0%a001240
	Well, it's fun travelling around with lots of different characters, right, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Dwight never says very much, though.
	It's a bit of a shame, really.
%0%a001250
	His grandad is definitely happy for him.
	He's really very fond of Dwight.
Sancho
	Thees s-señor Dwight, he ees esharp l-like the machete. I believe he ees a v-valuable comrade
	and a f-f-fine matador.
Tuppence
	Ha! Only because he'll more than likely come to some harm on his travels!
Tuppence
	The old man couldn't stand Dwight, could he?
	No? Barking up the wrong tree, am I?
Bianca
	He's got a nerve, callin' us funny! Still, it's refreshin' to hear someone speak their mind, eh?
Nera
	There's nothing wrong with a young man having a bit of spirit like that. %0%a001240's so well-behaved.
%0%a001240
	Hey! Are you saying you'd rather have a kid who's more like Dwight?
Nera
	Don't be silly, dear! You know you and %a001250 are my favourite people in all the world. Along with your father, of course.
%0%a001240
	It'll be fun to see how Dwight behaves on the battlefield, won't it, Dad? Ha ha!
%0%a001250
	Did you beat Dwight in a fight once, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Phew! Then I don't have to worry about him being around as long as you're here, too.
Sancho
	Anda! I was n-no expecting thees!
Tuppence
	He's just going to be lumped in with the other monsters though, correct? He won't be part
	of your select elite like I am.
%0%a001240
	That's weird. How come Dwight couldn't join us? Have we got too many monsters already?
%0%a001250
	To be honest, I'm quite relieved. Dwight gives me the creeps for some reason.
%0%a001240
	You should always say please when you ask someone a favour, right, Dad?
%0%a001250
	You're not cold! You're just doing what's best for us, aren't you, Dad?
Sancho
	Thees s-señor, he ees f-full of garbanzos, si?
	Djou n-no want heem to j-join us? Ees good to have esuch a f-fiery fighter. Si, fiery like a jalapeño.
Tuppence
	The cheek of it! How dare he address the King of Gotha with such insolence?
%0%a001240
	Dwight's pretty wild, isn't he? The way he fights has to be seen to be believed!
%0%a001250
	Do you think Dwight had fun travelling about with us? I don't find him as scary as I used to.
Sancho
	Ees g-good for us to have esomeone eso djoung weeth us, no? Djour Uncle S-Sancho, he n-no the djoung espring pollo he was before, djou know.
Tuppence
	Hmph! I won't allow that Dwight character to outshine me!
Bianca
	Well, we've got quite a fighter back on the team, eh?
Nera
	I'll have to stay on my toes now if I don't want Dwight to make fun of me.
%0%a001240
	Oh! Isn't Dwight going to be able to tag along?
	That's a shame.
%0%a001250
	I really like all the monsters you've had join the party so far, Dad.
%0%a001250
	So it'd be tricky to decide on someone to leave behind just so Dwight could take their place.
Tuppence
	You have plenty of good hardy fighters on side already, %a000090. There's no need to stoop to the likes of that Dwight character.
Bianca
	Huh? How come he couldn't join us?
Nera
	Oh dear. Dwight's certainly rather quick to throw in the towel, isn't he?
%0%a001240
	So Dwight moved back here! We should come back sometime and invite him to join us again.
Sancho
	Chico! Djou n-no learn these b-bad habits from me, djou know! Ees n-no good to esay ⓗnoⓘ all the time.
	No, no, no.
Sancho
	Djou m-must have the faith and answer ⓗsiⓘ.
	But ees n-no my fault eef djou esometimes f-f-find djourself een trouble because of thees, okay?
Tuppence
	I thought we parted with Dwight back over
	at Monty's.
Tuppence
	And yet here he is back in his cave. I suppose
	you have to admire him for making that journey
	all by himself.
Bianca
	You shouldn't tease him like that, %a000090! Surely he can come along?
Nera
	If the wagon was full, he'd end up having to go to Monty's, though.
Nera
	Do you think he'd really be alright with that?
Bianca
	What is it about caves? They're always so cold and damp, the whole world over.
Bianca
	You en't never spent a long stretch of time livin' in one place, right, %a000090?
Bianca
	Nope, you've bin on the road for pretty much all your life so far.
Bianca
	Eh? You lived at the Crocodilopolis? Ha! You can hardly call that livin'! ...Sorry. I didn't mean to bring back bad memories.
Bianca
	We should get a wriggle on to Nadiria if we're done and dusted here.
Bianca
	We're the sort of guardians of the legendary
	hero, after all. It wouldn't do for us to distract
	him too much.
Nera
	It's good to be able to walk around without fear in such a dank, cold place, isn't it?
Nera
	Waah!
Nera
	Sorry! There was some kind of furry insect by my foot. It took me by surprise, that's all.
Nera
	We should really try to move on if you're ready to, darling. We don't have much time.
%0%a001240
	You came here when you were little, right, Dad?
	With that faerie friend of yours.
%0%a001240
	You're so lucky! It'd be so much fun to go off adventuring with a faerie.
%0%a001240
	Now we're here, we should explore every nook and cranny. I want to see everything you saw when you were here last.
%0%a001240
	So this is where you came to find ⓗLots about Locksⓘ...
%0%a001240
	If only you still had the book with you now.
	I'd love to know what was in it.
%0%a001250
	I thought this cave would be so much nicer, what with it being in the Faerie Realm and everything.
%0%a001250
	I imagined flowers all over the walls, and lots of shiny things everywhere. Hmph.
%0%a001250
	I've never got lost in a cave before.
%0%a001250
	But %a001240 gets lost all the time. He just wanders on in without giving any thought to how to get back out again.
%0%a001250
	Whenever I walk through a cave, I always wonder what would happen if the sun suddenly shone right into the middle of it.
%0%a001250
	It would certainly give everyone a shock,
	wouldn't it?
Sancho
	Ah, ees another cave. Si, si...
	When I tr-travelled weeth s-señor Pankraz, we explored een m-m-many, many caves.
Sancho
	Djou know, ees n-no eso easy to t-take a djoung bebé weeth djou when djou are tr-travelling.
	Si, señor Pankraz, he was eso t-tough. Eso macho.
Sancho
	Esometimes now, chico, djou look j-just like djour father, señor P-Pankraz.
Sancho
	Si. Djou have gr-grown eento a f-f-fine man now, My Majesty.
Sancho
	Ees n-no good to be een a c-c-cave like thees where ees n-n-no action, djou know. I estart to ch-chatter like the castanets.
Tuppence
	The monsters around here are rather puny.
	I could fight these fellows off with one hand
	tied behind my back!
Tuppence
	I wouldn't turn down a bit of assistance if things took a dangerous turn, mind you.
Tuppence
	There don't appear to be any faeries here.
	Shall we be heading off, then?
%0%a001240
	Look, Dad! It's a Treasures & Trapdoors board!
%0%a001240
	I love T 'n' T just as much as you do! Is that why you brought me here?
%0%a001250
	Have you got a T 'n' T ticket, Dad?
	I'd love to have a go!
%0%a001250
	Of course! We've got a free pass so we can play as many times as we like! That's okay, right?
%0%a001250
	Hmm. This is a tricky one.
	I wonder which way to move.
Sancho
	When I ees travelling weeth señor Pankraz, we find many boards of T 'n' T. But we never estop to play, djou know.
Sancho
	I no put the espoon in. Ees good. Ees l-like the
	fiesta. Sancho, he likes the fiesta almost as
	m-much as the paella!
Tuppence
	This is a big T 'n' T  board. Quite an achievement for whoever built it, I'd say.
Tuppence
	You must let me try, %a000090! I've got lucky fingers, you know. I'll win us something good, trust me!
Bianca
	I'm not really very good at T 'n' T. I never seem to roll a good throw.
Bianca
	It can't hurt to let our hair down every once in a while. We could have a game here before movin'
	on, eh?
Nera
	I absolutely adore T 'n' T. It's so much fun
	rolling the dice!
Nera
	It's a shame that only one of us can go up on
	the board. It's so tense having to watch from
	the sidelines!
%0%a001240
	You defeated a bad monster here once, didn't you, Dad? You're cool!
%0%a001250
	Has that skeleton been left here all on his own?
	Poor thing!
Sancho
	Djou can walk all around thees b-board, si?
	Ees a good idea to esee what djou must do
	b-before djou estart the game, no?
%0%a001240
	Wow! He made this place all on his own?
%0%a001250
	Wouldn't it have been easier to build some
	stairs so he could get out, rather than
	building a T 'n' T board?
Sancho
	Thees man, he make esomething from nothing, eh?
	Ees a g-good quality, thees.
Tuppence
	Some people would have probably just given up the ghost if they fell down a hole like that.
Tuppence
	We're lucky that it was someone like him instead. Now, let's have some fun!
Bianca
	He certainly rolls with the times, eh? Fancy buildin' a T 'n' T board just because he got stuck in a hole!
Nera
	It's understandable that he felt the need to do something to ease his boredom. I was so bored I could have cried during those years as a statue.
