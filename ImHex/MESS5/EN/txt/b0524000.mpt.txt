Bianca
	So we're finally here in Gotha.
	It was a long old journey, eh?
Bianca
	I wonder why they've got walls all 'round the castle like that.
Nera
	So this is Gotha. We're here in your birthplace at last. It's been quite a journey to get here.
Nera
	It's certainly an impenetrable-looking castle.
	I wonder what it's like inside.
Bianca
	We can't prove it yet, eh? He'll be in for a shock when he finds out you are royalty, though!
Nera
	How frustrating! We can't argue with him at the moment, but the truth is that you really are royalty!
Bianca
	Looks like we can't get any further, then. We'll have to try another route.
Nera
	The King is probably just inside. How frustrating not to be able to reach him.
Bianca
	She's got a bit of a mouth on her, but bein' a princess alone is enough to impress me.
Nera
	That poor princess seems rather down in the dumps. Still, I think I can imagine how she must feel.
Bianca
	The more things we hear, the harder it is to forget we're here in your birthplace, eh, %a000090?
Nera
	We should try to find this Sancho character, then.
	It sounds like he's somewhere in the castle.
Bianca
	Wow! This place is amazin'! There's a whole town inside the castle walls!
Bianca
	There's prob'ly some folk here who know about you, %a000090. We should talk to as many of 'em as we can.
Nera
	So the town is inside the castle walls. I must say, it's a lovely place, with all its gardens and light spaces.
Nera
	Let's try talking to as many people as we can.
	We might just find someone who remembers you.
Bianca
	Hearin' him say that really brings it home to me that we've made it here to Gotha at last!
Nera
	So we've finally made it to Gotha. Thank the Goddess we were able to get here safely.
Bianca
	D'you think King Pankraz was really your dad, %a000090?
Bianca
	It's a bit hard to get your head 'round it all, eh?
Nera
	King Pankraz must've been quite a man to go to such trouble to ensure the safety of his people.
Bianca
	Sounds like they all got tired of waitin' for the old king to come home, eh?
Nera
	I wonder what kind of character this Prince Albert is. I do hope he's not a bad sort.
Bianca
	A craftsman, eh? It's funny that he left the castle like that. He must've bin ever so attached to
	King Pankraz.
Nera
	A god among jewellers? This must be a good place to live if they've had people of that kind of calibre here.
Bianca
	What a funny little boy! It could've bin fun to take him along with us if only he was a bit older.
Nera
	By the time he's grown up and become a soldier,
	we'll be middle-aged.
Bianca
	I second that! If I was a mum, I'd be sayin' exactly the same thing.
Nera
	I couldn't agree more. I hope our children never have to experience battles and danger like we've had to.
Bianca
	If it's the same Sancho as our Sancho, I'll bet he was in the church the whole time prayin' you'd be safe, %a000090.
Nera
	In church every day? Maybe he was praying someone dear to him would come home safe
	and sound.
Bianca
	We'd better try and find this Sancho character a bit sharpish. Come on!
Nera
	I wonder where we have to go to find this
	Sancho fellow.
Bianca
	Ten thousand gold coins? That's a bit neither here nor there, eh? Not a fortune, but not somethin' to be sniffed at neither.
Nera
	It looks like the new king did what he could to try to find the missing royal couple.
Bianca
	I can understand folk wantin' to remember King Pankraz, but they're goin' to have to move on
	sooner or later.
Nera
	It's not good for people to be so resistant to
	the truth.
Nera
	I'm sure King Pankraz wouldn't want him to be living in the past like that.
Bianca
	I wonder what this Albert character's like.
	I'm startin' to get a bit worried now.
Nera
	Does that mean King Albert has no dreams, then?
	It doesn't sound like he's very popular, does it?
Bianca
	Did you see that!? She had wings on her back!
	D'you think they were real? Just what kind of a character was she!?
Nera
	I think that lady was probably a Zenithian. I've read about them in the past.
Nera
	I never imagined I'd ever meet one in the
	flesh, though.
Bianca
	Sounds like Queen Mada was a lot like you, if she was the sort to keep a slime as a pet!
Nera
	Did you see that slime? He has the same kind of look in his eyes as the monsters you've befriended.
Bianca
	That's a shame. Dun't look like we're goin' to get any further this way.
Nera
	Oh well. We'll just have to try somewhere else.
Bianca
	Researchin' Zenithia, eh? King Pankraz was certainly a man of many secrets.
Nera
	I wonder why King Pankraz was carrying out research on Zenithia.
Nera
	If only that were clear, then there might be a way of putting the results to good use.
Bianca
	Do you know how to play?
Bianca
	Really? When did you learn that? Oh right, Pankraz taught you when you were little, eh?
Bianca
	Me neither. I wonder if it's really as much fun as it's cracked up to be.
Nera
	I remember watching Mama and Papa play that a
	long time ago. I'm afraid I've no idea what the rules are, though.
Debora
	It's fairly impressive as castles go.
Debora
	There are probably people here who know you.
	Let's hurry up and go inside.
Debora
	I can't wait to see his face when he finds out who you really are!
Debora
	Well there's no point in just hanging around here forever. Let's move on.
Debora
	I think I could probably get on with her.
Debora
	If this Sancho's a friend of yours, we should go and hunt him out.
Debora
	There's a whole town inside the castle walls.
	It's quite an interesting place by all accounts.
Debora
	I wonder if there's anyone who knows you here.
	You may not recognise them, but maybe they'll recognise you.
Debora
	I'm tired after all that trekking in the mountains.
	I wouldn't mind a bit of a rest.
Debora
	This is great. You can even shop here in the rain without getting wet.
Debora
	It doesn't seem to have done the place any harm not having a king all these years.
Debora
	I don't really see the need for them to have bothered having someone take his place.
Debora
	I remember Papa telling me that story once.
Debora
	I thought about having him make me something.
	I wonder if his son's any good.
Debora
	He seems nice and obedient. If he's lucky, I'll hire him as a servant when he's older.
Debora
	That's the reason why you have to get on and find the legendary hero.
Debora
	He's probably sick of the sight of the place.
	Three days would be about my limit.
Debora
	I doubt that Sancho character will turn up here.
	We should go and look for him somewhere else.
Debora
	Only a measly ten thousand gold coins for whoever finds the King?
Debora
	That's nothing! I certainly couldn't be bothered to go looking for him for that paltry reward.
Debora
	Why do some people have to insist on living in the past? This is why I always find old folk so annoying.
Debora
	I should think it's more important for a king to be realistic than to be forever chasing dreams.
Debora
	I think she was probably a Zenithian. I saw a picture of one before in a book of Papa's.
Debora
	I wonder what a Zenithian would be doing here in Gotha.
Debora
	So you're not the only one who can befriend monsters then.
Debora
	The soldiers' quarters are bound to be filthy anyway. Nothing in there of interest to us.
Debora
	Surely he can figure that out for himself rather than just moaning about it.
Debora
	Mama and Papa used to play that a lot.
	I was never interested myself.
