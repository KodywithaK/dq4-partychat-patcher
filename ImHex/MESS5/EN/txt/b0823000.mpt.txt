*: 
	Here's the line-up for the next fight.
	Which monster do you want to back?
*: 
	Yikes! You don't seem to have any tokens at all! Why don't you come back when you've bought a few?
*: 
	You want to bet on %a020030, right?
*: 
	It's one token per ticket, and you can buy up to fifty of them. How many do you want?
*: 
	You want to buy %a000710 ticket%H0710%X%Ys%Z for %a020030? Alrighty! Enjoy the show!
~ %0%a020030 comes out on top!  ~
*: 
	Congratulations! You won a monstrous %a000720 casino token%H0720%X%Ys%Z!
*: 
	Looks like you already have the maximum number of tokens there. Sure you still want to play?
*: 
	The next fight's about to start.
	Care to place another bet?
*: 
	Sorry, %a000120! %0%a020030 you bet on was knocked out.
*: 
	Oh well! You win some, you lose some.
*: 
	You'll lose your bet if you leave now.
	You're not really going so soon, are you?
*: 
	Then we'll call an end to the fight here.
*: 
	Hope to see you back again soon.
*: 
	Great! Hope you enjoy the rest of the show!
*: 
	Oh! So you're leaving already.
*: 
	Hope to see you back again soon.
*: 
	I have an announcement.
*: 
	Seeing as the battle's been going on for so long now, we've decided to call it a draw.
*: 
	We'll return the tickets you bet so you can use them on the next match.
*: 
	So you've had enough for today?
	As you wish! Come again soon.
~ %0%a020030 loses the match.  ~
*: 
	You can't pull out of this one.
	Which monster are you going to back?
*: 
	You've racked up more than 10000 tokens, so I'm afraid we're going to have to call an end to it here.
*: 
	You can bet the tokens you just received straight on the next fight. Are you game?
