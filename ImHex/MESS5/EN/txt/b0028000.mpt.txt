	Ⓠ With a hand to the soil,
	I work my honest toil,
	and listen out for gossip as I sow Ⓡ
*: 
	Chopping wood and living your life are just the same, really. The most important thing in both is
	good timing.
*: 
	I'll let you in on a little secret. I did battle with a fearful monster in a cave just west of Hay not long ago.
*: 
	You'll never guess what it was...
	A great sabrecat of all things!
*: 
	I say it was fearful, but I could tell it'd had some contact with humans. It might even have been someone's pet once.
*: 
	Maybe it could be tamed if it recognised something from its younger days.
*: 
	I tell you what. If you're feeling bored, why don't you take a look at that book on the counter there?
*: 
	We have all sorts in here, you know. And they all write things in it. You travellers certainly like to keep up on your gossip, don't you?
*: 
	Oh, is that the Scuttlebutt Alledger you've got there? Oh, yes. That's full of tittle-tattle, that is.
*: 
	Keep it if you want to. It's all gossip, mind. Don't take it too seriously!
*: 
	You can't help having a few thoughts on the subject when you run an inn, you know...
*: 
	If you ask me, I'd much rather travel with a few friends than on my own. It'd be like having a family with you.
*: 
	These two lads here are both my boys.
*: 
	I only wish they'd find themselves a couple of lovely brides and give me some grandchildren.
*: 
	Ssss!
*: 
	Welcome you to Stockenbarrel!
*: 
	The baths are a-cookin', so the place be a bit full of folk just now.
*: 
	Welcome you to Stockenbarrel!
*: 
	Bianca! Well, I'll be! We en't see your face 'round these parts in a good long while. I've bin a bit worried about you, so I have.
Bianca
	Yeah, well. Sorry about that. I didn't mean to make you anxious or nothin'.
*: 
	Welcome you to Stockenbarrel!
*: 
	Good to see you lookin' well as usual, Bianca.
*: 
	Purrr!
*: 
	That son of mine's only sayin' he wants to be a priest now, of all things!
*: 
	He's got the inside of our house decked out like it was a church, y'know.
*: 
	Meow.
*: 
	There's no need to be shy now. Why dun't you come a bit closer, eh?
*: 
	Oh! I thought you was the old girl!
	How embarrassin'!
*: 
	That one just refuses to accept he's no spring chicken any more, the silly old fool!
*: 
	Strike a light! You went an' found me!
*: 
	But that don't mean you're gettin' the treasure
	I nabbed!
*: 
	Huh! I'll get you for this one o' these days!
*: 
	I was soakin' in the bath and, when I got out, I realised my clothes was missin'!
*: 
	Maybe someone stole them! Yuck!
*: 
	Well, well, well! It's bin a while since we've seen you 'round here.
*: 
	What's bin keepin' you so busy that you couldn't even pop by and say hello, eh?
*: 
	When I think of the two of you out there on your travels in amongst all that danger, I'm beside myself with worry, I am!
*: 
	Well, well, well! It's bin a while since we've seen you 'round here.
*: 
	Bianca's bin ever so worried about you, %a000090. You should pop in on her more often, you know.
*: 
	Sorry, mate.
	Pub en't open durin' the day.
~ ⓗSee ya, everyone! I'm off to join that religion and go to that White King's Paradise place!ⓘ ~
*: 
	You as well, eh? I don't blame you.
	The baths here turn up some real beauties.
*: 
	I'm talking about bath crystals, of course!
	The famous Stockenbarrel scintillating sinter!
*: 
	I'm afraid no good things in life come for free, though. What I'd really like is a desert rose.
*: 
	You sometimes come across them in the desert. If you could find me one, I'd be more than happy to give you some sinter in exchange.
*: 
	Wait a minute! Don't go telling any of the villagers about this, okay? This is just between you and me.
*: 
	You as well, eh? I don't blame you.
	The baths here turn up some real beauties.
*: 
	I'm talking about bath crystals, of course!
	The famous Stockenbarrel scintillating sinter!
*: 
	Uh oh! You live here, don't you, love?
*: 
	N-Never mind all that I was saying.
	It was nothing. Ha ha!
*: 
	Hey! That's a desert rose you've got there. Wow! I've been after one of those for ages!
*: 
	I don't suppose I could have yours?
*: 
	Blimey! Thanks a lot, mate! Here, I'll give you some of the world-renowned scintillating sinter in return.
~ %0%a000120 receives some scintillating sinter! ~

*: 
	Yep, there's nothing prettier than a desert rose.
*: 
	It's all the better now because it gives you a taste of the outside world, holding somethin' so exotic.
*: 
	Well, that's a disappointment. I was planning on giving you some scintillating sinter in return, as well...
*: 
	Yep, there's nothing prettier than a desert rose.
*: 
	By the way, have you ever heard of a loyalty card? It can make all the difference to your shopping experience, apparently.
*: 
	Rumour has it that you can win it as a special prize at the tombola.
*: 
	En't you that ole friend of Bianca's?
*: 
	Dun't you go puttin' her into any danger, d'you hear? Else you'll have me to answer to.
*: 
	Blimey! Bianca! Where in the world have you bin!? We en't seen you here in donkey's years!
Bianca
	I know. Sorry. Things have bin really busy and it was hard to find the time to come back and visit.
*: 
	Fair 'nough. Just make sure you come and see that old dad of yours once in a while, eh?
*: 
	That daft young lad at the inn just can't seem to get to grips with his work. Old Whitey's at the end of his tether.
*: 
	En't you that ole friend of Bianca's?
*: 
	So you got wed to that town girl, did ya?
*: 
	I know it's a bit late, but I want you to have this as a little pressie. It en't much, mind.

*: 
	Oh, it's such hard work learnin' how to run an inn.
*: 
	Of all the luck, bein' born son of an innkeeper!
Whitey
	Zzzz... Zzzz...
Whitey
	Oops! I nodded off again. That'll never do!
Whitey
	Hm? Oh! Heavens above! It's you, %a000090!
Whitey
	Where in the world have you bin all these years,
	me old friend?
Whitey
	Good grief! You were turned into stone!? Well, of all the things!
Whitey
	Talk about bad luck, eh?
Whitey
	There's no need to discuss Bianca.
Whitey
	I know you'll rescue her. I trust you, see, %a000090.
Whitey
	By the way, are these kiddies by any chance...?
Whitey
	I knew it! So they're yours and Bianca's, eh?
Whitey
	Yeah, I can see it actually. They look just like the two of you when you were little. And a bit like me, oddly enough!
Whitey
	It sounds like things have bin far from easy up to now, but they're growin' up wonderfully!
Whitey
	You know, it must be eight years now since you and Bianca disappeared, %a000090.
Whitey
	That makes me feel ever so old! Ha ha!
Whitey
	I dun't imagine there's much an old man like me can do.
Whitey
	But if there is anythin' at all that you can think of, you just let me know.
Whitey
	I'll be prayin' that you're all safe. And my dear wife in heaven will be too, of course.
Whitey
	Come on now, %a000090! You can't pull the wool over my eyes!
Whitey
	Those kiddies are yours and Bianca's, en't they?
*: 
	Oh, it's such hard work learnin' how to run an inn.
*: 
	Of all the luck, bein' born son of an innkeeper!
*: 
	At least I get to see Bianca, mind you!
	Huh huh huh!
Whitey
	Zzzz... Zzzz...
Whitey
	Oops! I nodded off again. That'll never do!
Whitey
	Hm? Oh! Heavens above! It's you, %a000090!
Whitey
	We haven't seen hide nor hair of you for years! Bianca's bin ever so worried, you know.
Whitey
	There's bin all sorts of odd rumours
	flyin' about just lately too.
Whitey
	Hey! Who are them kiddies with you?
Whitey
	Crikey! Yours, are they!? Now there's a turn-up!
Whitey
	They do look an awful lot like you, come to think of it.
Whitey
	Well, well, well. So now you're a father, %a000090. That makes me feel ever so old!
Bianca
	%0%a000090! Thank the Goddess you're safe!
Bianca
	I was wonderin' what'd become of you after all those years of you not showin' your face.
Bianca
	You've had a bit of a tough time of it, eh? You really have grown so big and strong, though.
Bianca
	You were no use to man or beast that time we went off ghost-bustin' together all them years ago!
Bianca
	I'm sure you have what it takes now to make Pankraz's dream a reality.
*: 
	Meow.
*: 
	(splish splash)
*: 
	Aaah! You can't beat havin' the baths pretty much to yourself.
*: 
	Strike a light! You went an' found me!
*: 
	But that don't mean you're gettin' the treasure
	I nabbed!
*: 
	Huh! I'll get you for this one o' these days!
*: 
	Stop right there! If you've come to give me the hard sell, you're wastin' your time!
*: 
	Oh! You're not one of them, eh? I thought you were another o' those Order of Zugzwang folk come to drum up support.
*: 
	Goo! Goo!
*: 
	Well, well, well! It's bin a while since we've seen you 'round here.
*: 
	What's bin keepin' you so busy that you couldn't even pop by and say hello, eh?
*: 
	When I think of the two of you out there on your travels in amongst all that danger, I'm beside myself with worry, I am!
*: 
	Well, well, well! It's bin a while since we've seen you 'round here.
*: 
	Bianca's bin ever so worried about you, %a000090. You should pop in on her more often, you know.
*: 
	Ah-phew, ah-phew...
*: 
	Uuurgh, my 'ead! Hic!
*: 
	Zzzz... Oh, Bianca... Zzzz...
*: 
	That guy's so lovely.
*: 
	It sounds like he fancies some girl called Bianca, but I can soon make him forget about her!
*: 
	I was in the water so long today that my hands have gone all shrivelled-up and pruny!
*: 
	Hic! She's a scary old woman, that wife o' mine.
	A man's gotta drink if he wants the courage to face that one!
*: 
	Oh dear. That fella from the armour shop is on a roll again tonight. That wife of his'll be livid.
*: 
	Purrr...purrr...purrr...
*: 
	This is Lodestar Harbour.
*: 
	Hey, mate! You 'eard of the famous thief,
	M. Bezzler?
*: 
	He plundered stuff from all over the world after nickin' the ultimate key, but he can't do no more damage now.
*: 
	Seems he came to a sticky end by bein' gobbled up by a monster the size of a mountain!
*: 
	I wonder who managed to lock a monster that big up in the first place!
*: 
	I s'pose it just goes to show that even the best of the best can meet 'is match, though, eh?
*: 
	My son was always a fine sailor.
*: 
	But then his boat was attacked by monsters.
*: 
	It's very painful for me to think about what happened to him.
*: 
	But I'm old now. My one consolation is that it won't be long before I meet with my son again.
*: 
	Hey! Have you heard?
*: 
	So the rumours are true!
*: 
	Seems that they're building a huge temple at the very top of Mt Azimuth.
*: 
	People are saying that the Grandmaster of Nadiria is trying to destroy our world.
*: 
	We need a plan! Then we can attack him first and put a stop to all this, rather than just sitting back and waiting for it to happen!
*: 
	According to ancient manuscripts, there's a giant dragon god that reigns over our world.
*: 
	If that were true, though, why would he allow the monsters to run riot like they are?
*: 
	I used to want to be a pharmacist, y'know.
*: 
	But then the bloke who was teachin' me all about medicine went and popped his clogs.
*: 
	That all feels like a lifetime ago now.
*: 
	I always dreamt of bein' a sailor, even when I was a young lad.
*: 
	There are too many monsters about for us to sail too far afield at the moment.
*: 
	But one of these days, I'm goin' to sail around the whole world huntin' out treasure!
*: 
	Travellin' about by boat, are you?
*: 
	No? You're flyin' around on a magic carpet!?
*: 
	Don't make me laugh! I'm not fooled that easy, you know! People can't fly!
*: 
	Aaah. Monsters can be quite cute when they're tame like that.
*: 
	What!? Travelling with monsters!? You shouldn't tease a man when he's sloshed, you know. Hic!
*: 
	Greetings! Welcome to the best pub in Lodestar Harbour...the only pub in Lodestar Harbour,
	in fact.
*: 
	Well, well. Been a customer of ours in the past, have you?
*: 
	I only started work here recently, so you probably know the ropes here better than I do!
*: 
	My husband and I are travelling the world in search of the legendary hero.
*: 
	But countless years have passed now, and we still don't seem any closer.
*: 
	This is our second time here in Lodestar.
	The last time we were here was probably nigh
	on a decade ago now.
*: 
	Zzzz... The Grandmaster of the Underworld is attempting to take over our world...
*: 
	I must find the legendary hero and inform him immediately... Zzzz...
Lyn Gerie
	I am sorry, but if you are wanting ze autograph, I cannot give it. I say non to everybody.
Lyn Gerie
	Dancing on ze stage every night is more zan enough to keep me busy.
Lyn Gerie
	But I always give a performance zat is la crème de la crème!
Lyn Gerie
	Tonight will be another dance extraordinaire, so I 'ope you will come and watch, cherie.
*: 
	Our performances are only at night, cherie.
*: 
	Come back zen if vous voulez un show you'll never forget.
*: 
	Alors! I just cannot seem to get ze make-up right at all today.
*: 
	Maybe I 'ave 'ad too much of ze old joie de vivre. 'Ic!
*: 
	Step right up! Get your souvenirs here! One of these famous Lodestar ships in a bottle could be yours!
*: 
	Look at the superb construction! See the fine finish! And all for just one thousand gold coins! What d'you say?
*: 
	That's right! You'd be crazy to pass up this unbelievable offer. I'll just pop it in your bag for you.
*: 
	Oh dear! You haven't got enough cash.
	I can't discount something of this quality, you understand, %A0110%Xsir%Z%B0110%Xmadam%Z.
*: 
	Shame. But maybe next time, eh?
*: 
	Aargh! I dropped my ship in a bottle!
*: 
	I'm travelling around in search of a legendary key that's said to open almost any door in the world!
*: 
	Folk say the grand thief, M. Bezzler,
	had his hands on it once, but that was
	a long time ago now.
Ogar
	Have you had a look through the telescope? You'll have probably seen the big mountain to the south-east if you did.
Ogar
	That'd be Mt Azimuth. Totally impossible for mere humans to climb.
Ogar
	People are saying that the Dragon God has disappeared of late.
Ogar
	And that some folk are trying to take advantage of that by getting up to no good now there's no one there to stop them.
*: 
	Meow.
~ It's a telescope. ~
~ Look through it? ~
*: 
	Huh! Stupid curtains stopping me from seeing properly! Oh, my dear beautiful Lyn Gerie...
*: 
	Hic! This 'ere's Lodestar 'Arbour.
*: 
	The monsters out in the ocean are stronger than ever nowadays. You really take your life in your hands if you take to the waves.
*: 
	(sob) Give my son back! Zzzz...
*: 
	From time to time, a flickering flame rises up from the dark depths of the ocean.
*: 
	That flame is a sad reminder of the many
	lives lost at sea when boats have been attacked
	by monsters.
*: 
	Oh dear. The thought of it makes me too choked up to even think about my poetry.
*: 
	I'm only just back from a long trip out to sea.
*: 
	But seein' my wife's happy face as she's sleepin' is enough to make me forget my exhaustion. Ah, it's good to be back!
*: 
	Ah-phew, ah-phew...
*: 
	I'm so worried. My boy's become a sailor, and it's such a dangerous occupation nowadays.
*: 
	He's saying he wants to go off around the world hunting out treasure.
*: 
	I just wish he'd realise life itself is the greatest treasure he'll ever have.
*: 
	Gurgh-phew, gurgh-phew...
*: 
	Yay! A treasure map!
	Zzzz...
*: 
	I've been workin' here for fifteen years now, y'know.
*: 
	I ain't like other folk, choppin' and changin' all the while. This is my career!
*: 
	No matter how bad things get, you can
	always relax with a nice little tipple
	and a good dance show.
*: 
	That's the great thing about being a man, I suppose. Ha ha ha!
*: 
	See that dancing girl there?
	I'm her biggest fan, me!
*: 
	Come on, Lyn Gerie!
	Swing over my way!
*: 
	See that girl in the middle? She's the latest big hit. Goes by the name of Lyn Gerie.
*: 
	She's the best, as far as I'm concerned.
	Whenever she changes towns, I follow her!
*: 
	Yep... I reckon this must be the eighth time I've been back here in Lodestar!
*: 
	Travellin' about by boat, are you?
*: 
	No? You're flyin' around on a magic carpet!?
*: 
	Don't make me laugh! I'm not fooled that easy, you know! People can't fly!
*: 
	You may not believe this, but I once met the legendary hero, you know. In the flesh and everything!
*: 
	It was a long time ago now, but I can still remember his name.
*: 
	Let's see... It was Pancreas! ...No, that's not right. Um...Pancakes! Hmph. That's not it either.
*: 
	Never mind, anyway! I met him and that's all that matters. And he's going to save the world, so none of us need worry!
*: 
	Greetings! Welcome to the best pub in Lodestar Harbour...the only pub in Lodestar Harbour,
	in fact.

*: 
	%H0860%XA traveller%YTravellers%Z, are you? I was on the move myself until recently. Heading for that White King's Paradise everyone's talking about.
*: 
	But these ships in bottles I was making for fun were selling like hot cakes, so I thought to myself, ⓗHow much better can it get!?ⓘ
*: 
	Ah, you never know in this life, do you, eh?
*: 
	Zzzz... The Grandmaster of the Underworld is attempting to take over our world...

*: 
	Pretty good, eh? If you use your head, you can find the best seat in the house!
*: 
	The secret of this little spot has been passed down the generations, so to speak. I'm the sixth bloke here!
*: 
	No doubt you're hopin' to sneak a peek
	as well, right?
*: 
	I wish I could help you, mate, but there are already ten people in the queue before you!
*: 
	You'll have to just try and find a good spot of your own, eh? Heh heh heh.
*: 
	Oh yeah? No need to put up a front with me, mate. Heh heh heh.
*: 
	That girl who was here all them years ago, Cleo... She weren't a bad sort.

Lyn Gerie

	That's it, Bailiff. Them gets some proper feisty scrappers in that there pub.
*: 
	No! I dun't like the idea.
