Bianca
	Come on, let's go and explore! I can show you around so you don't go gettin' yourself lost, %a000090.
Bianca
	Mum still treats me like I'm just a little baby.
Bianca
	I hope Dad gets better again soon.
Bianca
	Your father looks so strong and powerful.
Bianca
	You're a bit weedy compared to him. Maybe you'll get more like him as you grow up, though, eh?
Bianca
	Ha ha! Did that little story give you a fright, %a000090?
Bianca
	It dun't scare me one bit. I've heard it so many times now that I just take it with a pinch of salt.
Bianca
	Our place is an inn, so we've got quite a lot of crockery and the like. I dun't remember seein' anythin' silver, though.
Bianca
	There's quite a few shops here in Roundbeck, y'know. Our inn's the biggest, though.
Bianca
	He's got a blimmin' cheek, thinkin' we're out to cause trouble!
Bianca
	Ha! What he dun't realise is that I know he falls asleep of a night. I've seen him!
Bianca
	Those kids are always up to no good.
Bianca
	You wun't believe what they did to me the othⓚⓛ Never mind. It's nothin'!
Bianca
	Now I dun't have any choice but to go off ghostbustin'. Will you give me a hand, %a000090?
Bianca
	Really!? You're braver than you look!
	I never expected you to say yes.
Bianca
	Oh, go on! I'll be with you, so you wun't come to any harm or nothin'. Let's go!
Bianca
	I wonder if there really are ghosts there.
Bianca
	We can't let those nasty brats get away with bullyin' that poor little cat!
Bianca
	Hang in there just a bit longer, puss. We'll rescue you, dun't you worry.
Bianca
	That's a funny old purr you've got goin' there, though!
Bianca
	It's hard to imagine that old man was ever young, eh!?
Bianca
	Kids aren't supposed to come in here, %a000090! I suppose you couldn't have known that, though.
Bianca
	I bet my mum would be just the same if I said I wanted a cat. Mums, eh!?
Bianca
	It's a lot livelier than little old Whealbrook, eh? You look a bit surprised.
Bianca
	You used to come 'round my house to play quite a lot when you were little. Don't you remember?
Bianca
	This is the best room in the house.
	The view from here's amazin'.
Bianca
	Mum planted a grapevine last year.
Bianca
	When we get some grapes off it, I'll let you have a taste.
Bianca
	You still a bit sleepy, %a000090?
Bianca
	You'd better get with it if we're off to Uptaten Towers on our ghostbustin' mission.
Bianca
	I'm not sure I believe you. Unless you're sayin' you always look that dopey.
Bianca
	This time we'll manage it. We'll sort them ghosts out and set that poor kitten free.
Bianca
	Watch out, %a000090! We'll be in trouble if you wake him up.
Bianca
	I dun't think I'd be scared of a ghost if it was just standin' there cryin'.
Bianca
	I hope Mum dun't catch Dad's cold, sleepin' that close and all.
Bianca
	We've had cold weather for ages now.
	It's no surprise Dad got ill with it.
Bianca
	Fancy thinkin' we're ghosts! Charmin'!
Bianca
	I knew he'd be asleep. Looks like we can leave.
	I'm a little bit nervous now, though.
Bianca
	It's hard to imagine that old man was ever young, eh!?
Bianca
	Oops. Looks like we're in trouble. But it's not like we were up to no good or nothin'.
Bianca
	Looks like it's not a good idea for kids to go in a pub of a night after all.
Bianca
	I know! We should come back here again one day when we're all grown up, %a000090!
Bianca
	We'll do it! And that's a promise.
Bianca
	I understand what he's gettin' at. The glass you drink from can be just as important as the drink itself.
Bianca
	I wonder why grown-ups act so funny when they've bin drinkin'. I dun't get it.
Bianca
	Are you okay, %a000090? Maybe we should've bin a bit more careful, eh?
Bianca
	We'd better try and take it a bit more slowly this time.
Bianca
	I've never snuck out of town like this before.
	It's well excitin'!
Bianca
	We saved the cat and we helped those nice people at the castle, so it was worth all the effort.
Bianca
	Ha! So he dun't think I'm a wimp any more.
Bianca
	I wun't too sure if I'd manage it either! I doubt I could've done it without you, %a000090.
Bianca
	%0%a001210 seems pretty happy. I hope he likes his new name.
Bianca
	That guard always falls asleep of a night, so he can't stop us goin' out. You've seen it for yourself now, eh, %a000090?
Bianca
	I'm startin' to feel a bit weird havin' all this praise lumped on me.
Bianca
	She must have blimmin' good ears to be able to hear cries from the castle at this distance!
Bianca
	I thought I'd really be for it, but Mum dun't seem all that angry.
Bianca
	I bet it's because you were there with me, %a000090.
Bianca
	You're pretty brave considerin' you're two years younger than me and all that.
Bianca
	I reckon havin' you along helped me to be that bit braver as well.
Bianca
	Looks like you'll be goin' back to Whealbrook once you've said your goodbyes, eh?
Bianca
	Um... Never mind. You'd better get around and tell everyone you're off.
Bianca
	You should take %a001210 along with you, %a000090. Make sure you give him a stroke from me every now and then.
Bianca
	That's all that old bloke ever says. We must really remind him of how he used to be.
Bianca
	All we were tryin' to do was save %a001210. You wouldn't have thought it'd cause such a fuss.
Bianca
	It's good that your dad's got over his cold already.
Bianca
	But I wish it didn't mean you have to go home today. We've bin havin' a good laugh together, you and me.
Bianca
	It's a little bit odd-lookin', but it's still quite cute as cats go.
Bianca
	I wonder why there are so many gravestones here at the entrance to the castle.
Bianca
	I dun't much like the look of this.
Bianca
	That's weird! Last thing I knew, we were stayin' at the inn inside the castle.
Bianca
	So how did we end up outside?
	I dun't like this one bit!
Bianca
	It dun't look like we're goin' to get that door open. This castle's fallin' to bits.
	I s'pose no one comes here no more.
Bianca
	I've got a horrible cold feelin' up and down my spine. You be careful, okay, %a000090?
Bianca
	Keep your eyes peeled, okay, %a000090?
	I've got a nasty feelin' about this place.
Bianca
	.........!
Bianca
	I was a bit scared for a while back there, but it's all just show, I reckon.
Bianca
	Nothin' can frighten me now!
Bianca
	I wonder if she used to be the head of the castle.
	Shall we try goin' down those stairs?
Bianca
	That poor woman. Fancy still havin' to suffer even after you're dead!
Bianca
	Come on, %a000090! Let's get to work. We came here to get rid of ghosts, after all.
Bianca
	Yikes! That was a bit of a shock! The lightning's so strong all of a sudden.
Bianca
	I wonder if that fella who just disappeared was the king or suchlike of this place.
Bianca
	Why do the both of them keep disappearin' rather than just comin' out with whatever it is they want to say?
Bianca
	Those must be the folk who are made to keep dancin'. The poor things. They look exhausted.
Bianca
	Where's this king fella off to!?
Bianca
	He's a bit of a pushy one, eh? Still, we can agree to what he wants because that's the reason we're here anyway.
Bianca
	I s'pose the Count's tryin' to help us out as much as he can. That's good.
Bianca
	Shall we head on down to the kitchen and get that torch then, %a000090?
Bianca
	I s'pose it's time then. It's a bit scary, but I'm sure we can do it, %a000090.
Bianca
	I was a bit frightened at first, but when I saw the Count and Countess, it wasn't all that scary.
Bianca
	And this room's so full of people that it sort of feels nice and lively, not spooky at all!
Bianca
	Still, it is a bit weird when you think we're the only ones here who are actually alive. Hm, maybe it is a bit scary, after all!
Bianca
	What's so scary about these spirits of Nadiria?
	I don't really get what he's on about.
Bianca
	I wonder why there are some human ghosts and some non-human ghosts too.
Bianca
	Maybe they lost their bodies somehow, so they can't go back to how they used to look.
Bianca
	What nasty creatures!
Bianca
	I never imagined skeletons could get hungry.
	I wonder what happens to the stuff they eat.
Bianca
	What d'you suppose skeletons like to eat, anyway? Nah! Maybe it's best not to know.
Bianca
	They don't seem to be able to see us.
	I suppose skeletons must be blind.
Bianca
	That poor girl. They've probably bin makin' her dance like that for years now.
Bianca
	I wonder if this %a000100 is part of the tea set.
Bianca
	It's as dirty as anything, though. The Count and Countess would be really sad if they saw it in this state.
Bianca
	It must be horrible wantin' to sleep but not bein' able to.
Bianca
	I want to sort these ghosts out and then get off to bed myself, to be honest. Best get crackin'!
Bianca
	The door's open! I didn't much like the feel of that warm breeze just then, mind.
Bianca
	There's somethin' too weird about this. I dun't like the idea of stayin' the night with a dead spirit!
Bianca
	I heard somethin' about there bein' treasure here too. Looks like it was just a rumour. Oh well.
Bianca
	Crikey! What a smell! Come on, %a000090. 
	Let's get out of here!
Bianca
	I feel a bit sorry for the special ingredient, havin' to be smothered in that stinky sauce!
Bianca
	Now we'll be able to find our way in the dark. Thanks, Count Uptaten!
Bianca
	Make sure you dun't burn yourself, %a000090.
Bianca
	It's a million times easier to walk about the place now. Ouch! That's hot! Have a care, %a000090!
Bianca
	Phew! That was a close one. That smelly sauce has made me stink, mind you!
Bianca
	I didn't expect that hole to be there, did you?
Bianca
	Looks like we put that cook's mind at ease, anyway.
Bianca
	Now we just have to sort out the boss man.
	Come on, %a000090!
Bianca
	That really is a pretty ball.
	It's like a huge jewel or somethin'!
Bianca
	I wonder if the ghosts came here and ransacked the place because they were tryin' to find it.
Bianca
	That's weird! Our clothes are all nice and clean again!
Bianca
	The Count and Countess must've got rid of the nasty sauce stains for us somehow.
	That's handy!
Bianca
	I dun't like it here. It's dark and creepy. I reckon there are ghosts about.
Bianca
	But we have to stick it out for the sake of that poor cat. Come on, %a000090. Let's keep goin'.
Bianca
	The creepy feelin' about this place has suddenly gone now the ghosts are defeated.
Bianca
	It's like everythin' about the place has changed, even the air!
Bianca
	Looks like it'll be mornin' soon.
	We'd best get back to Roundbeck.
Bianca
	We can't seem to get out of here now. B-But I'm sure we'll be okay if we keep goin' forwards!
Bianca
	I thought it'd be too dark to get anywhere, but we should be fine now. On we go, %a000090.
Bianca
	I wonder what made the ghosts come and live here in the first place.
Bianca
	What is it about this castle that attracted them, d'you suppose?
Bianca
	Now everyone's bin able to get off to sleep nice and peacefully. It's great to have done a good deed like that.
Bianca
	This room's enormous. Just look at the height of the ceilin'!
Bianca
	I'll bet they had some amazin' balls and parties here in the past.
Bianca
	You've bin a bit quiet, %a000090.
	Are you wishin' you hadn't come?
Bianca
	I know how you feel. But try not to worry. I won't let anythin' bad happen, I promise.
Bianca
	You're probably a bit nervous, eh? But try not to worry. We'll be fine. Come on!
Bianca
	It's so dark in here! Make sure you dun't bang into the walls, eh, %a000090?
Bianca
	I think there's somethin' there, %a000090. But I doubt it'll hurt us. We can probably just ignore it, right?
Bianca
	It's finally time for our ghost-bustin', eh?
	Are you ready for this?
Bianca
	Then let's go! We can do this!
Bianca
	Why en't you ready? D'you need to go to the toilet or somethin'!?
Bianca
	Honestly! Just go over there and hurry up
	with it!
Bianca
	Let's go get the boss man! He'll pay for all this!
Bianca
	Those were weird ghosts, eh? I wonder if they were the spirits of Nadiria.
Bianca
	This castle's enormous! I dun't know how anyone could find their way around.
Bianca
	I can't really tell the difference between ghosts and monsters and spirits. They're all the same
	to me.
Bianca
	This must be the kitchen. Let's find that torch.
Bianca
	Let's go. I know you're probably wonderin' about the food, but we need to get that ghost before we do anythin'.
Bianca
	I dun't think I've ever seen so much dust. I wonder how long it's bin since this place had a good clean.
Bianca
	What's wrong, %a000090?
	Are you scared?
Bianca
	Just keep thinkin' about that cat.
	You want to help it, right?
Bianca
	Ha ha! You're braver than you look, %a000090. I'm impressed!
Bianca
	Looks like the monsters have all gone now.
	That's good news.
Bianca
	It'll be mornin' soon.
	We'd better get back to Roundbeck.
Bianca
	The Whealbrook guard has a snooze at night-time, dun't he?
Bianca
	Still, he's there blockin' the village entrance even so. I'd say that puts him above the fella at Roundbeck.
Bianca
	En't we supposed to be gettin' over to Uptaten Towers for a spot of ghostbustin', %a000090?
Bianca
	Then what are we doin' here in Whealbrook? You don't have much sense of direction, eh?
Bianca
	We're done with the ghostbustin' now, and it'll be mornin' soon. We should hurry up and get back to Roundbeck.
Bianca
	Dun't you think we'd better get a move on with our ghostbustin'?
Bianca
	We'll be in trouble if the grown-ups wake up and spot us here.
Bianca
	What are you doin', %a000090!? What's the point in speakin' to folk when they're asleep, eh?
Bianca
	No way! I can't believe we made it this far all on our own!
Bianca
	What am I sayin'!? We shouldn't be standin' 'round here pattin' ourselves on the back. We need to get over to Uptaten Towers!
Bianca
	I've come over all sleepy all of a sudden. Can we go back to Roundbeck now?
Bianca
	This fella's doin' a good job of standin' guard, eh? He's not sleepin' on the job even though it's night-time.
Bianca
	It's great fun bein' able to wander about outside the village like this, eh?
Bianca
	I'm well impressed that we've made it this far, though. We've come a long way, you and me.
Bianca
	Aren't you feelin' tired, %a000090? I'm ready to go back to Roundbeck myself.
Bianca
	What are you up to, %a000090? We've done our ghostbustin', so it's time we got off home.
Bianca
	People say you run into monsters if you wander about outside of town, dun't they? 
Bianca
	Still, we got to go and sort out those ghosts at Uptaten Towers, so it's no good worryin' ourselves about that.
Bianca
	You and your old man Pankraz have bin travellin' about together for a good long while now, haven't you, %a000090?
Bianca
	You're so lucky. The only place I've ever bin is borin' old Whealbrook.
Bianca
	This ghostbustin' trip will be the furthest I've travelled, y'know.
Bianca
	Let's hurry up and sort them ghosts out so we can save that poor cat!
Bianca
	Maybe we've gone and agreed to somethin' a bit too tricky. I hope we'll be able to save that poor little cat.
Bianca
	We did it! We're the bee's knees, you and me!
Bianca
	I won't get a wink of sleep tonight now!
Bianca
	I can hardly wait for mornin' to roll around.
	It'll be wonderful to get that poor cat away from them horrible boys.
Honey
	It wasn't a dream, you know. Faeries are real!
	And so is Faerie Lea, and everything else in the Realm of the Faeries.
Honey
	I mean, you're talking to me now, aren't you?
	So it couldn't have been a dream, could it?
Honey
	Your dad looks really tough. Yes, he's the kind of human I was hoping to find to help us.
Honey
	Oops-a-daisy! I didn't mean I'm not happy with you. I am. Honest! Tee hee hee!
Honey
	I bet you'll grow up to be a great man too, %a000090. Just like your father.
Honey
	I mean, you got the Herald of Spring back for us. That's amazing!
Honey
	No one else would understand, even if you told them all about me and the other faeries.
Honey
	It'd better be our little secret. Just between you and me. Tee hee! It'll be fun, won't it?
Honey
	It is a little bit chilly here, I suppose.
	But compared to where I come from, it's like an oven.
Honey
	I'm sorry. I've put you in danger, and you're just a boy too.
Honey
	If only grown-up humans could see me as well. Then I wouldn't have had to ask you to help us.
Honey
	All the grown-ups just see you as a normal little boy, don't they? Well never judge a book by its cover! That's what we faeries say.
Honey
	If winter never ends, everything'll be frozen by the ice, and no one will have anything to eat.
Honey
	We have to get the flute back! We need the Herald of Spring to bring an end to the freezing winter.
Honey
	Now you can grow your vegetables again. Those sweet potatoes you humans eat are yummy. I'll sneak back and have some more sometime!
Honey
	Your village has such a warm atmosphere, %a000090. Not the temperature, silly! I mean all the nice people.
Honey
	It's true. If you were a bit older, things wouldn't be so difficult for me, either.
Honey
	Oops! I, I didn't mean that.
	I mean... Tee hee hee hee!
Honey
	That old man's a silly billy! What does he know?
Honey
	You'd be a great help to your father, if only he'd let you.
Honey
	That young man looked like...
	No, it can't be...
Honey
	He had a strange look in his eyes, didn't he?
	Just like you...
Honey
	I didn't want to ask you to help us. I don't like putting you in danger. But I had no choice.
Honey
	The danger's passed now. Come on, let's go and tell Treacle the good news!
Honey
	You've been moving from place to place your whole life, haven't you? That's why you're so used to travelling.
Honey
	It wasn't me! Not this time.
Honey
	Tee hee hee! He's worse than me, that old man with his tricks!
Honey
	Hee hee! He's really puzzled!
	Well I wrote it, so I get to rub it out. That's fair, isn't it?
Honey
	You see, I'm really quite a good little faerie.
	That's why Treacle chose me.
Honey
	Someone's after your father?
	Oh no! I suppose we faeries aren't the only ones with problems.
Honey
	You'll help protect your father. I know you will. And I'll be looking out for you both too.
Honey
	The legendary hero? But...he's not real, is he?
	I mean, a legend's a legend, isn't it?
Honey
	If your father really was a king, that would make you a prince!
Honey
	So, Prince %a000090! I, Honey the faerie, humbly request your assistance to save my homeland. ...Tee hee hee!
Honey
	If your father really was a king, that would make you a prince!
Honey
	Well, Prince %a000090! One is most honoured to have been assisted by Your Royal Highliness! ...Tee hee hee!
Honey
	That's exactly what I think too! When you look at me, I feel all fuzzy and warm inside!
Honey
	And you can see me. You've definitely got better eyes than all the other humans!
Honey
	There's a lovely warm atmosphere in this little town.
Honey
	You're ready to go back to the Realm of the Faeries now? Alright then, better prepare for battle!
Honey
	Let's go back to Faerie Lea, then.
	Treacle will be over the moon!
Honey
	Actually, this is where I first met you, isn't it, %a000090?
Honey
	I was at such a loss because no one could see me that I started to sing at the top of my voice.
Honey
	And then you spoke to me. I was so happy, I could have burst!
Honey
	So some of you humans live in little caves like this? I thought only the dwarfs did that. You're a funny lot.
Honey
	Tee hee! Maybe we overdid it a bit.
Honey
	You're only young. I shouldn't push you so hard...
Honey
	No one would believe we beat the Winter Queen before, getting wiped out like that! Must've been a lapse of concentration, I suppose.
Honey
	Anyway, Treacle's expecting us. I can't wait to see her face when we take her the Herald of Spring!
Honey
	I hope we'll make a good team, %a000090!
Honey
	I knew it. Treacle's not sure about you because you're so young.
Honey
	That's why she wants me to go along with you:
	to make sure nothing happens to you.
Honey
	It's true that we faeries aren't very strong, but we're amazing at magic. You can leave all the healing and support spells to me!
Honey
	Maybe the world really will freeze over completely if we can't get the Herald of Spring back...
Honey
	None of us faeries knows what's going on inside the Winter Palace, you see.
Honey
	What's wrong with everyone!? You'll make a great warrior, they'll see. Come on! We need to head out into the cold...
Honey
	Oh, yes! The spring in Faerie Lea is wonderful!
	Blossom covers everything. Even the air takes on a sweet, pink tinge.
Honey
	Well I think Treacle's right. Why shouldn't we all live together? That faerie's called Butterscotch, but we call her Bitterscotch! Tee hee hee!
Honey
	I'm sure faeries and humans and monsters can all live together if we all try really hard!
Honey
	That slime always used to say, ⓗI'm not a bad slime, you know!ⓘ And it's true. It left all its bad monster instincts behind.
Honey
	It was just wandering about on its own when Treacle invited it to live in Faerie Lea.
Honey
	What!? That little kitten's a great sabrecat!?
Honey
	Heⓚⓛ Hee hee! O-Of course it is! I knew that. That's how I knew you were special just as soon as I met you.
Honey
	Ⓠ When you're cold and blue, Ⓠ
	You need a bath 'n' shampoo Ⓡ
	Tee hee hee! I wish I could get in too!
Honey
	The last village elder was really strict. You could get in trouble for anything. Even if you upset the peace just a teeny-weeny bit.
Honey
	He only passed away recently. So Treacle's only been village elder for a little while, you see.
Honey
	There are quite a few dwarfs living here in Faerie Lea, you know. They're merchants, mostly. And artisans too.
Honey
	It still feels good to come home, even though things aren't quite right here.
Honey
	That's unforgivable, thinking so sourly about Treacle! Dwight's mean!
	...Er, who is this Dwight dwarf anyway?
Honey
	Unforgivable, thinking so sourly about Treacle!
Honey
	That old dwarf's been living here all this time because he was thrown out of Faerie Lea.
Honey
	What Dwight's done is unforgivable, but I do feel sorry for the old dwarf. So I suppose I can understand why Dwight did what he did.
Honey
	I don't trust that slime. It came out with ⓗI'm not a bad slimeⓘ before we'd even said anything.
	And who is this Dwight, anyway?
Honey
	That man talks funny. I don't trust him. If you ask me, I think he's looking for ⓗLots about Locksⓘ to help him steal things.
Honey
	Come on! We've got to find it first!
Honey
	We never used to have people like him in our world.
Honey
	Maybe it's a sign of bad things to come. I suppose that's why the old village elder was so strict.
Honey
	Tee hee hee! ⓗLots about Locksⓘ for me! Ⓡ
	I can't believe you told him you'd already found it!
Honey
	He looked so scary. You're really brave, %a000090.
Honey
	Yippee! Now we can open locked doors all over the place!
Honey
	But no peeking behind doors you shouldn't be peeking behind! Tee hee! Tee hee hee!
Honey
	Wowee! It really works!
	You really can open locked doors now!
Honey
	Tee hee hee! It makes you think of all sorts of cheeky tricks and naughty things we could get up to! No wonder the village elder was worried.
Honey
	I never knew there was a cave here before.
Honey
	I wonder how far it goes down...
Honey
	This is my first time in a cave. In fact, I've hardly been outside Faerie Lea at all until now...
Honey
	If I'd come here on my own, I don't know if I'd have found my way out again.
Honey
	It's a bit embarrassing actually, but...well...
	Hee hee hee! My sense of direction is abysmal.
	It's lucky I came with you.
Honey
	This place is yucky. It's dark and wet and infested with monsters and yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yucky!
Honey
	And that old dwarf's had to live in here all this time. Tee hee heⓚⓛ
	Oops! I mean, poor thing!
Honey
	I'd never been in a cave until now. I thought it'd be really exciting and fun, but I'm bored.
Honey
	I'm so bored I could die! I don't know how you put up with it, %a000090.
Honey
	Do you think that Dwight boy is really sorry for what he did? I'm not so sure...
Honey
	That slime said it was Dwight right from the start, didn't it?
Honey
	I knew it was telling the truth all along.
	Tee hee hee!
Honey
	You see!? That Dwight boy's not sorry at all!
Honey
	He's just a troublemaker if you ask me.
Honey
	Er...%a000090...
	Treacle wants the Herald of Spring back as soon as possible.
Honey
	Hello? Can you hear me?
	No more side trips, okay?
Honey
	You're teasing me, aren't you? You know I hate caves.
	Tee hee hee! You're worse than me, %a000090!
Honey
	It's locked, just like everyone said.
	Weren't you listening, %a000090?
Honey
	Hey! Didn't someone tell us about a dwarf who was thrown out of Faerie Lea for writing a book called ⓗLots about Locksⓘ or something...?
Honey
	Sweet! We're in!
	But now it gets scary!
Honey
	We've no idea what's waiting in here.
	Better tread gingerbreadly... Tee hee hee!
Honey
	Unbelievable! The White Dwarⓚⓛ I mean, Dwight, just left without so much as a sorry!
Honey
	Come on! Time to get the Herald of Spring at last!
Honey
	This p-palace is so b-beautiful, but so c-c-cold!
	Brrr...
Honey
	If it was summer, a cool place like this would be yummy. But in winter it's yucky!
Honey
	You can't underestimate anyone, you see. Even a child. But we'll beat that Dwight dwarf next time!
Honey
	Tee hee hee! You are a warrior, see. I was right!
	I knew it all along!
Honey
	We better not let Treacle down. She's probably watching us even now...
Honey
	Hey, wait a minute! We can't leave without the Herald of Spring.
Honey
	Yippee! Now we can summon springtime at last!
Honey
	But we can't relax just yet. This adventure's not over till we make it home!
Honey
	Ow, ow, ow, ouch! Ouch!
	I hate this place! Who puts holes in the middle of such a slippery floor anyway!?
Honey
	Hee hee! You can't stop where you think, can you?
	We need to think about this a bit...
Honey
	Erm... First we move to there... Then to there... And then...erm...to...err...
	Tee hee! Got you! I haven't got a clue, silly!
Honey
	I, I'm a bit amazed too. I wasn't really sure you'd be able to get it back either, %a000090. Sorry. Hee hee hee!
Honey
	I wonder too... A bit! But who cares now!?
	Ⓠ We beat the Winter Queen,
	ner-nee ner-nee ner ner! Ⓡ
Honey
	If it got really, really cold, do you think a slime might stop wobbling about and go all hard like a stone?
Honey
	Tee hee hee! That'd be fun!
	I wish we could try it.
Honey
	ⓗEven bigger problemsⓘ? What a cheek! We should all be yahooing now, not boohooing!
Honey
	You are brave, it's true. And strong. And clever. And nice. And, and, and... Are all humans like you?
Honey
	This is our world, where all the faeries live.
	You come from the human world. And then there's the underworld, where the monsters live.
Honey
	What? Where is the underworld?
	Well, er......it's, er......I...
	It's...underneath us! Yes, that's where it is!
Honey
	(gulp) I knew it. Treacle's been watching us the whole time.
Honey
	I didn't do anything silly, did I?
	Or say anything bad?
	Oh, no. I bet I'm in trouble...
Honey
	I'm sorry, %a000090. Some faeries don't like humans very much.
Honey
	But I'm sure they'll all feel differently now that you've saved the day!
Honey
	I can't wait for spring!
	I want to watch all the pretty blossoms dancing around me in the warm breeze!
Honey
	Only Treacle can summon spring. She has to blow the Herald of Spring herself.
Honey
	At the first sweet sound of the flute, spring will burst into life!
Honey
	We can't keep the Herald of Spring forever, silly! We've got to give it to Treacle.
Honey
	The snow goes on and on forever, you know.
	But really, it should be spring by now. All the pretty flowers should be bursting into life...
Honey
	You're very quiet, aren't you?
	Do you miss your home already?
Honey
	I wonder if we'll manage to get the Herald of Spring back. I mean, you're only small, aren't you? Tee hee hee!
Honey
	I wonder why Treacle asked me to accompany you... I suppose she wants me to keep an eye on you.
Honey
	You're just a boy after all. You need someone a bit older to make sure you don't get into trouble. ...That's me!
Honey
	There's something special about you. I'm sure of it. We faeries are never wrong about things like that, you know. Never.
Honey
	It's always cold in winter, but never this cold. Something's not right...
Honey
	This is the first time I've ever been exploring like this, so I'm feeling a little bit nervous.
Honey
	I know it's still freezing cold, but inside I feel like spring already! Yippee!
Honey
	You really are amazing! I bet that inside you're just full to the brim of special magic bits and bobs!
Honey
	Treacle will be waiting for us.
	We must get back to Faerie Lea.
Pankraz
	I'm sorry I left you behind at the castle before.
	I was just so worried about Prince Harry.
Pankraz
	I'll take the rear this time, so you don't need to worry about keeping up with me.
Pankraz
	Why would they kidnap the Prince? If it was just for ransom money, I'd be less concerned, but I'm not so sure...
Pankraz
	I fear for Prince Harry's life. We can't afford to waste any time!
Pankraz
	I'm sorry, %a000090. I was so focused on finding Prince Harry, I wasn't paying enough attention to you.
Pankraz
	But in times of crisis like this, I need you to look after yourself. You can do that for me, can't you, %a000090?
Pankraz
	A monster too? Hm, I don't like the sound of this.
	We must find the Prince at once.
Pankraz
	Argh! The barefacedness of these thugs!
	If we had more time, I'd teach them a lesson right now.
Pankraz
	But we must find Prince Harry first.
	Come on, %a000090, you lead the way!
Pankraz
	I knew it! The Queen Consort was involved!
Pankraz
	The King was right to be worried. But what a way for his fears to be realised!
Pankraz
	Oh, yes. I've been meaning to ask you about that young man you were talking to in Whealbrook before we left for Coburg.
Pankraz
	When I spoke to him, he asked how our travels were going. I felt like I recognised him, but
	I just can't put a name to his face.
Pankraz
	I'm worried about Prince Harry. There's no time to talk. Just keep moving.
Prince Harry
	I... I don't like this place...
Prince Harry
	I wonder if... I wonder if your father will be alright?
Prince Harry
	Your father was right. I suppose I ought to speak with Father when I get back to Coburg.
Harry
	I forgot to tell you, but I found this T 'n' T ticket during the time I was a slave.
Harry
	I would've thrown it away in the blink of an eye back in the old days!
Harry
	But you hang on to any little scrap of anything you come by when you have so little.
Harry
	I'm right behind you too, %a000090! We'll do this together!
Harry
	It looks like Maria really is going to stay on here.
Harry
	What!? Why are you looking at me like that, %a000090? You must feel a little sad about it too, right?
Harry
	We'll just have to hope we'll have the chance to meet up with her again one day.
Harry
	How can you be so cold? Oh well, it's no skin off my nose.
Harry
	Fortuna? I don't think I've ever heard of such a town before.
Harry
	Just walking back through the gate of this place makes me feel more relaxed.
Harry
	I wonder how Maria's getting along.
	Shall we pop inside and see her?
Harry
	Did you bring me here to make me feel better, %a000090?
Harry
	You didn't have to, really you didn't.
	But thank you.
Harry
	That's quite an impressive statue!
Harry
	We should keep it with us all the time.
	It probably has divine powers.
Harry
	It's hard to imagine either of us as good husbands when you think we were both slaves until just recently!
Harry
	But we know what it feels like to be miserable because of someone else's violence, so at least we'll never be like her brute of a husband.
Harry
	We know more about suffering than most, that's for sure. It's been a rocky ride for us so far.
Harry
	Huh... Now we have even more worry and sadness to be burdened with.
Harry
	I wonder why Maria seems so lonely.
	Maybe it's because I'm not around.
Harry
	Er, no, I'm sure that's not it.
	If only it was, though...
Harry
	I hope Joshua didn't get into trouble for helping us to escape.
Harry
	I just wish there was something we could do. Argh! I feel so helpless!
Harry
	As long as I have a bed to sleep in, I'm happy. We've got another long day ahead of us, %a000090!
Harry
	I feel much better after that rest.
	Thanks, %a000090.
Harry
	To tell you the truth, I'm still not quite used to sleeping in a bed again. I suppose it's because I was a slave for such a long time.
Harry
	You don't need to worry about me, %a000090. Let's move on.
Harry
	The Order of Zugzwang was so odd, kidnapping rich and high-class children like that.
Harry
	Children are too weak to be of any use, so what's the point? Maybe it's because they're easier to influence.
Harry
	I didn't realise rich girls came here to do domestic goddess training of all things!
	It sounds like a terrible bind.
Harry
	Did you bring me here to make me feel better, %a000090?
Harry
	You didn't have to, really you didn't.
	But thank you.
Harry
	I wish I was a cat. Then Maria and I could beⓚⓛ Er! Never mind!
Harry
	How wonderful it must be to be a cat.
	They never have anything to worry about.
Harry
	After all we've been through, being able to sleep in a comfortable bed is pure bliss. Here's to another fruitful day, %a000090!
Harry
	I feel much better after that rest.
	Thanks, %a000090.
Harry
	Why don't we stay here for the night? It's late now, and this is where Maria is. Let's stay!
Harry
	You don't need to worry about me, %a000090. Let's move on.
Harry
	You know... Maria is the first woman I've ever met who I can truly say is both beautiful and kind-hearted.
Harry
	She's so warm and friendly. She reminds me of my mother, who died when I was just a small boy.
Harry
	Hm? You have a childhood friend like that?
Harry
	You lucky thing! You'll have to introduce me to her one day. Don't forget now, will you?
Harry
	You know... Maria is the first woman I've ever met who I can truly say is both beautiful and kind-hearted.
Harry
	She's so warm and friendly. She reminds me of my mother, who died when I was just a small boy.
Harry
	You've got a childhood friend like her, you said.
	Bianca, wasn't it?
Harry
	I hope you get to see her again one day.
Harry
	Maria's face is red?
Harry
	Maybe she's gone and caught a cold from staying up too late. Oh dear! I do hope she's alright!
