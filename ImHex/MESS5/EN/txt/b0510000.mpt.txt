Bianca
	It's pretty amazin' findin' such a huge buildin' in the middle of the woods like this, eh?
Nera
	What a beautiful mansion. I wonder if someone famous lives here.
%0%a001240
	Wow! Who do you think built such a huge mansion?
%0%a001250
	It's a very impressive building, but it looks like it was put up quite a few years ago now.
%0%a001250
	It feels calm on the surface, but there's a very strange air to it.
Sancho
	Look at thees! I, I no expect to esee esuch
	beauty een a place like thees.
	Ees, ees eso moving! (blub)
Tuppence
	Good heavens! I'm rather bowled over by the place, it's so beautiful.
Bianca
	Fancy waitin' so long you end up dyin'! Maybe we should try and help the old guy out, eh?
Bianca
	So this place is a museum. It's a lovely spot, but it en't exactly on the beaten track, is it?
Nera
	Um, d-do you think that old gentleman is a
	real g-ghost?
Nera
	I was hoping I might have misheard.
Nera
	A haunted old museum... Hardly the kind of place most people would be happy about going inside.
%0%a001240
	So is that old man dead, then?
%0%a001240
	The knick-knackatory? That sounds like fun!
%0%a001250
	What a funny old man, with his funny-looking halo and his funny old stick.
%0%a001250
	Maybe he's not properly dead yet.
Sancho
	Ees no easy to run a museum, you know.
Sancho
	But thees old señor, he esees very well, no?
	He knows what we are carrying estraight away.
Tuppence
	Hmm. We already have quite a lot on our plates as it is, really.
Tuppence
	But if agreeing to this means we take control of such a fabulous building, we can't possibly say no!
Bianca
	We've got our own agenda, so we can't very well go travellin' about the place huntin' out souvenirs the whole time.
Bianca
	Still, if we just happen to come across a few along our way, then I dun't see that doin' any harm.
Nera
	I should think most people would question a strange proposition like that.
%0%a001240
	Sancho always told us we should do what we could to help people in need.
%0%a001240
	That old man's not exactly a person any more because he's a ghost and everything, but maybe we should still lend a hand?
%0%a001250
	The museum, or knick-knackatory as he calls it, obviously means a lot to him. That's why he can't tear himself away.
Sancho
	Ees true. For thees old señor to find the knick-knacks heemself, ees gonna be very hard. Harder than when he was alive, even.
Sancho
	You no theenk we eshould help heem?
Tuppence
	Ooh, that old man's eyes were so distant!
	That's quite a trick!
Bianca
	A hidden treasure in a castle! That sounds like fun! We should go and have a look, %a000090.
Nera
	If the old man was unable to find it, I'm a bit doubtful as to whether we'll have any more luck.
%0%a001240
	King Dominicus's Dominion...
	I thought that place was just famous for its chocolate medalliyums.
%0%a001250
	Sancho took us to King Dominicus's Dominion before.
	I don't remember hearing anything about a dream souvenir there, though.
Sancho
	The castle of King Dominicus, ees no eso far from here, sí? Maybe we eshould go there and esee what we can find.
Tuppence
	A dream souvenir... Wonderful! There's nothing like a good treasure hunt.
Bianca
	D'you reckon this dream souvenir over at King Dominicus's Dominion can really be all that special?
	I'm startin' to get a bit curious now!
Nera
	I wish we could bring it to him, I really do, but this dream souvenir of his is proving rather hard to find.
%0%a001240
	The old man's still standing there looking hopeful, even though he's dead and everything.
%0%a001240
	I feel a bit sorry for him, really. Shall we try
	and find that dream souvenir he keeps going
	on about, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I think we should try to help the old man out
	a little, Dad.
%0%a001250
	He'll never make his way to the Goddess with his dream unfulfilled like this.
Sancho
	Ees eso esad to look at thees old señor when he ees eso unhappy. I, I... (blub)
Tuppence
	A dream souvenir... Wonderful! There's nothing like a good treasure hunt.
Bianca
	It's ours? This whole place is ours?
	I can hardly believe it!
Nera
	He j-just... He went right through the d-door...
	I feel all giddy.
Nera
	It's a delightful museum, but it does feel rather like it has a bit too much history to it.
%0%a001240
	The old man just disappeared! Let's go inside!
%0%a001250
	The maxi medal was just causing problems for everyone back at King Dominicus's Dominion.
%0%a001250
	And yet look how happy it made Old Man Nick Knack! I'll bet the medal itself feels much more contented here too.
Sancho
	But friend. I no theenk ees the time for us to be playing the museum curator, no? We have muchos, muchos to do.
Tuppence
	Good heavens! So now this museum is all miⓚⓛ
	Er, I mean, all yours, %a000090.
	I'm rather envious, I must admit.
Bianca
	So it's goodbye Old Man Nick Knack.
	He did so much for us here at the museum.
Bianca
	Shame we didn't have enough time to
	thank him properly.
Nera
	So the old man's spirit has finally made its way to
	the Goddess.
Nera
	I'll miss him, but it's good that he's made his journey to the heavens at last.
%0%a001240
	He's gone! Does that mean we won't get to see him any more?
%0%a001250
	Old Man Nick Knack may be no longer with us...
%0%a001250
	But I can't help feeling that he's not too far away.
Sancho
	Ees because of your efforts, My Majesty, that thees knick-knackatory ees esuch a fine place now.
Sancho
	Thees old señor, now he can rest at last.
Tuppence
	I always knew the time to say goodbye would be upon us one day.
Tuppence
	But that doesn't stop it from being hard to come to terms with when it happens.
Bianca
	Well, there's a turn-up! He just meant he was goin' off for a kip!
Nera
	It's good that he's having a nice sleep, but...
	Ooh, this is all rather bemusing.
%0%a001240
	The old man seems to have forgotten he's a ghost!
%0%a001240
	He doesn't look like he'll be waking up for a while.
	But we can cope on our own now, right?
%0%a001250
	I did feel like I could still sense his presence, but I didn't realise that was because he was still here!
%0%a001250
	He's in such a deep sleep. Do you think it's okay that he's not making any moves to go to the Goddess?
Sancho
	Sí, thees ees how you take the siesta!
Sancho
	Now thees old señor, he ees esleeping, eet means you have become the real man, My Majesty.
Tuppence
	I don't believe I've ever seen a snoring ghost before.
Debora
	That's a decent-sized building.
	I wouldn't want to live here, though.
	There's nothing for miles around.
Debora
	I see. He had work left undone when he died. That's why he became a ghost and couldn't leave the place.
Debora
	If he wants to see it that much, why doesn't he just go and find it himself? He's a ghost now, so it's not like the journey would wear him out.
Debora
	I don't like taking orders from anyone.
	Let's get out of here.
Debora
	You're not planning on going in search of it, are you?
Debora
	Fine, fine, if you insist. I'll come with you, but I'm not going to help you look.
Debora
	Hm, that's odd. I was sure a little challenge like this would be just your cup of tea.
Debora
	A dream souvenir... Sounds like a bit of a pain, but shall we see if we can find it?
Debora
	Museum curator? It'd better not be too much work.
Debora
	Now that he's enlisted our help, it looks like his business here is done and he can finally leave.
Debora
	Hmph! He could've picked his turn of phrase more carefully. I thought he meant he was gone for good when he said he was going to rest in peace.
