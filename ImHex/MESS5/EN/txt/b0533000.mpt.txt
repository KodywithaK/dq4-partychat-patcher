	If only I'd been bigger when Mum was snatched away, then I could've done something.
%0%a001250
	I came here before with Sancho and %a001240. We wanted to see the places you'd been through yourself.
%0%a001240
	You came here before with some talaria,
	didn't you, Dad?
%0%a001240
	I wonder who would make flying shoes like that. What a funny idea!
Sancho
	I no eso happy to be here again.
Sancho
	When I theenk about all the pain and the esuffering you have been through, friend, eet, eet makes me eso miserable... (sob)
Tuppence
	When I think about the Chancellor, it strikes
	me how odd people can be, being taken in
	by monsters like that.
Bianca
	I think I came by here when the monsters snatched me, but I can't be sure.
Nera
	I wasn't all that scared when the monsters snatched me away.
Nera
	I was much more worried about you getting hurt if you tried to come and rescue me.
%0%a001240
	I know all about this! Normal ink goes all faint and hard to read if it's left for a long time.
%0%a001240
	So people have to rewrite everything before it ends up impossible to read. I remember the nun in Gotha doing it.
Nera
	I remember being shown the manuscript during my time at the abbey. It's a wonderful piece of work.
Nera
	Imagine being written in its own special ink!
	That shows how grand it must be.
%0%a001240
	It's weird to find an inn with a church upstairs.
	But maybe it means the Goddess watches over
	people who sleep here.
%0%a001240
	Is this the amazing ink people talk about so much?
	I'd love to try using it sometime!
%0%a001250
	Do you think this ink really stays put for, say, a hundred or even a thousand years?
%0%a001250
	That means you can't write anything too weird, otherwise people in the future will be laughing
	at you.
Sancho
	Anda! Ees cooking for eseveral years!?
	You must look after eet well, friend.
Tuppence
	Do you think it's really alright for us to accept this ink if it took so much effort to make it? I should imagine it would cost a fortune to buy.
%0%a001240
	I've seen that man here before. He's been working on that ink for ages.
Tuppence
	I say! If you don't want any, %a000090, then I'd beⓚⓛ No, never mind. I'm sure you're right.
%0%a001250
	He seems so happy that he's succeeded that he can't manage to think of anything else!
%0%a001240
	If I were him, I'd tell everyone how it's done and have them all making ink for me.
%0%a001250
	These local specialities can bring in so much
	money to places. I suppose that's why they're
	so important to people.
Sancho
	I remember thees eenk, we order eet once when I was leeving een Gotha.
Sancho
	Eet was used at the wedding of señor Pankraz and señora Mada for esigning the marriage certificate. Eet, eet was esuch a happy time!
%0%a001240
	I wonder what the statues here are of. Do you think Mum looks something like this?
Bianca
	You really had everyone worried when you went off lookin' for me, %a000090.
Bianca
	In an ideal world, it would be nice not to have to worry them again, but still...
Nera
	Who would have thought back then that it would
	be so many years before we returned home safe and sound?
Nera
	It's such a shame that we caused so much trouble and worry for everyone.
%0%a001240
	Ever since we were tiny, I remember that people were always trying their hardest to find you again.
%0%a001240
	And in the end, %a001250 and I grew big enough to be able to come looking for you ourselves.
%0%a001250
	Don't go disappearing again, will you, Dad.
	It was really hard work trying to find you.
Sancho
	I remember when you were missing, friend. Prince Albert, he would no esleep unteel you were found.
Sancho
	You are eso lucky, friend... I mean, My Majesty.
	You are loved by eso many peoples...
Tuppence
	This place isn't all that far from Gotha, but you
	can't get here on foot. It must've been quite tricky for them.
Sancho
	Qué? Who ees the estronger man, you or señor Pankraz?
Sancho
	No, no, friend. You are estill just a child. You can no compare yourself to your father.
Bianca
	Never a truer word has bin spoken. Pankraz really was an incredible man.
Bianca
	Don't look at me like that, %a000090!
	You're Pankraz's son, after all. So you en't
	that bad neither!
Nera
	In all my years in this world, I don't think I've ever met a more solid character than you! He he he!
Tuppence
	I see! That means looks are probably a factor in all this too. Maybe I should spend more time working on my eyebrows...
%0%a001250
	If Grandpa was such a good man, then that means you must be pretty amazing too, Dad.
Debora
	I remember this place. When I was kidnapped by those monsters, I put up quite a fight!
Debora
	I can't think of a job more boring than transcribing text to make copies of a manuscript.
Debora
	The idea alone almost sends me to sleep.
Debora
	I know I caused people a lot of worry when I went missing, but I can't help it if they hold me in such high regard.
Debora
	By the way, it wasn't just you who was out looking for me all that time, was it? There were other soldiers too, right?
Debora
	There's a solid character standing right in front of him. Don't you agree, %a000090?
Debora
	Oh, don't just stand there looking gormless!
	Snap to attention now, there's a good servant!
