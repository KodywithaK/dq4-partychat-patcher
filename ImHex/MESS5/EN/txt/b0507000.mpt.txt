Bianca
	I was a bit too casual about this desert lark.
	If it weren't for this oasis, I'd have prob'ly shrivelled up and died!
Bianca
	There's even some greenery here! It really is an oasis in the middle of a desert. Wouldn't want to
	live here, mind.
Bianca
	I reckon I could drink enough water to fill a small lake at the moment! Mustn't drink this place dry, mind.
Nera
	I'm okay, r-really. Don't worry about me. I'm fine now we're here at the oasis.
Nera
	We should make sure we have some water while we're here so that we can rehydrate a little.
Nera
	Do you think people set up home here so that they could help weary travellers like us?
Nera
	Whether that's the reason or not, I don't think I could be more grateful to find them here!
Bianca
	It must be awful bein' a dog in the heat like this.
	It's not like it can take its coat off.
Nera
	That poor dog! It must be absolutely boiling.
Bianca
	It's nice and cool inside the tent. If you can just get out of the sun, it makes a big difference.
Nera
	It only looks like a small tent from the outside, but it's surprisingly well-equipped. You could probably live here quite comfortably.
Bianca
	Looks like not many people pass by here.
	Not surprisin', really.
Bianca
	I always thought people who live out in the sticks like this would be a bit unfriendly, but he was lovely.
Nera
	Helmunaptra to the west and King Dominicus's Dominion to the south-east. That's right, isn't it?
	I'm terrible at remembering directions.
Nera
	You can decide where to go. I'll go along with whatever you choose.
Bianca
	He was a bit aggressive at first! I wonder what them desert roses he was talkin' about are.
Nera
	I think a desert rose is a special kind of mineral you get around these parts.
Bianca
	A museum. That sounds like it could be
	a bit of a laugh!
Nera
	I wonder how long ago that man was here. I'd quite like to visit the museum if it's been built by now.
Bianca
	Hah! We've got a desert rose of our own,
	thanks very much!
Nera
	He must have an awful lot of desert roses for him to call it a collection.
Bianca
	Brrr. It's quite chilly in the desert of a night, eh?
Bianca
	I reckon I might've caught a cold.
	I'm feelin' a bit feverish.
Nera
	Boiling hot in the day and freezing cold at night.
	The desert is certainly a place of extremes.
Nera
	Take care not to catch a cold or anything,
	won't you?
Bianca
	It's not quite as cold inside the tent. Looks like the dog has that figured out too!
Nera
	I think that dog's trying to protect the old man,
	you know. Isn't that sweet?
Bianca
	Looks like not many people pass by here.
	Not surprisin', really.
Bianca
	I always thought people who live out in the sticks like this would be a bit unfriendly, but he was lovely.
Nera
	Helmunaptra to the west and King Dominicus's Dominion to the south-east. That's right, isn't it?
	I'm terrible at remembering directions.
Nera
	You can decide where to go. I'll go along with whatever you choose.
Nera
	Oops! We woke that old man up. We should try to be quiet so that he can get some sleep.
Debora
	You know what you have to do now we're at the oasis, right?
Debora
	Precisely. Bring me some water. Not just to drink, either. I'm going to have a wash too, so make sure you bring plenty.
Debora
	Do I have to spell everything out for you? You have to bring me some water. I want a drink, of course!
Debora
	And you'd better bring plenty while you're at it, because I'm going to have a wash as well.
Debora
	It's a bit shabby, but at least it should give us a bit of respite from the heat.
Debora
	What are you waiting for, %a000090?
	I'm going in.
Debora
	I wish I'd brought my swimming costume now. It would be lovely to have a splash about and cool off.
Debora
	It must be unbearably hot with all that fur.
	It's bad enough for us.
Debora
	It's cooler in here than I thought it would be.
	Aah, just what I needed. Bring me a glass of water, will you, %a000090?
Debora
	It doesn't sound like many people make it all the way out here.
Debora
	Helmunaptra to the west... King Dominicus's Dominion to the south-east, right? You'd better write it down so I don't have to bother remembering it.
Debora
	A museum? For some reason, I always seem to get very drowsy whenever I visit museums.
Debora
	His way of greeting people certainly leaves a lot to be desired. What a yob!
Debora
	I bet he was actually desperate to show off his collection. Well, I don't want to see it, so there!
Debora
	His way of greeting people certainly leaves a lot to be desired. What a yob!
Debora
	I bet he was actually desperate to show off his collection. Well, I'm not interested, so there!
Debora
	It's getting cold now. There's no happy medium in the desert, is there? You're either too hot or too cold.
Debora
	So you'd better take care, %a000090. Make sure you don't let me catch a cold or anything.
Debora
	I wonder how Bingo's getting on. He always liked to have company. A bit like me, really. Maybe he's lonely...
Debora
	Sorry? Ha! No, I'm fine. I'm not lonely any more.
	How could I be, with you always hanging around?
Debora
	This dog's trying to protect the old man, isn't he? That's what I like about dogs: they always obey their masters.
Debora
	What are we standing around for? Let's go!
	We can't hang around here forever. That poor
	man will never get any sleep otherwise.
Debora
	Helmunaptra to the west and King Dominicus's Dominion to the south-east?
	I'll just pick one and go there.
Debora
	All you have to do is follow.
