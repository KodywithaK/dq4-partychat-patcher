	You know Dwight and that slime, don't you, Dad? Sometimes it feels like you know everyone in the whole world!
%0%a001250
	I wouldn't mind living in a cave if I had a slime to keep me company. ...But maybe it's not such a 
	good idea.
Tuppence
	So the poor old man worried himself to death?
	What a fiend this Dwight character must be!
Bianca
	I s'pose too much worry could kill you if you weren't careful. Dun't you go gettin' too stressed out, will you, %a000090?
%0%a001240
	Well, it's fun travelling around with lots of different characters, right, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Dwight never says very much, though.
	It's a bit of a shame, really.
%0%a001250
	His grandad is definitely happy for him.
	He's really very fond of Dwight.
Sancho
	Thees señor Dwight, he ees esharp like the machete. I believe he ees a valuable comrade
	and a fine matador.
Tuppence
	Ha! Only because he'll more than likely come to some harm on his travels!
Tuppence
	The old man couldn't stand Dwight, could he?
	No? Barking up the wrong tree, am I?
Bianca
	He's got a nerve, callin' us funny! Still, it's refreshin' to hear someone speak their mind, eh?
Nera
	There's nothing wrong with a young man having a bit of spirit like that. %0%a001240's so well-behaved.
%0%a001240
	Hey! Are you saying you'd rather have a kid who's more like Dwight?
Nera
	Don't be silly, dear! You know you and %a001250 are my favourite people in all the world. Along with your father, of course.
%0%a001240
	It'll be fun to see how Dwight behaves on the battlefield, won't it, Dad? Ha ha!
%0%a001250
	Did you beat Dwight in a fight once, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Phew! Then I don't have to worry about him being around as long as you're here too.
Sancho
	Anda! I was no expecting thees!
Tuppence
	He's just going to be lumped in with the other monsters though, correct? He won't be part
	of your select elite like I am.
%0%a001240
	That's weird. How come Dwight couldn't join us? Have we got too many monsters already?
%0%a001250
	To be honest, I'm quite relieved. Dwight gives me the creeps for some reason.
%0%a001240
	You should always say please when you ask someone a favour, right, Dad?
%0%a001250
	You're not cold! You're just doing what's best for us, aren't you, Dad?
Sancho
	Thees señor, he ees full of garbanzos, sí?
	You no want heem to join us? Ees good to have esuch a fiery fighter. Sí, fiery like a jalapeño.
Tuppence
	The cheek of it! How dare he address the King of Gotha with such insolence!
%0%a001240
	Dwight's pretty wild, isn't he? The way he fights has to be seen to be believed!
%0%a001250
	Do you think Dwight had fun travelling about with us? I don't find him as scary as I used to.
Sancho
	Ees good for us to have esomeone eso young weeth us, no? Your Uncle Sancho, he no the young espring pollo he was before, you know.
Tuppence
	Hmph! I won't allow that Dwight character to outshine me!
Bianca
	Well, we've got quite a fighter back on the team, eh?
Nera
	I'll have to stay on my toes now if I don't want Dwight to make fun of me.
%0%a001240
	Oh! Isn't Dwight going to be able to tag along?
	That's a shame.
%0%a001250
	I really like all the monsters you've had join the party so far, Dad.
%0%a001250
	So it'd be tricky to decide on someone to leave behind just so Dwight could take their place.
Tuppence
	You have plenty of good hardy fighters on side already, %a000090. There's no need to stoop to the likes of that Dwight character.
Bianca
	Huh? How come he couldn't join us?
Nera
	Oh dear. Dwight's certainly rather quick to throw in the towel, isn't he?
%0%a001240
	So Dwight moved back here! We should come back sometime and invite him to join us again.
Sancho
	Friend! You no learn these bad habits from me, you know! Ees no good to esay ⓗnoⓘ all the time.
	No, no, no.
Sancho
	You must have the faith and answer ⓗsíⓘ.
	But ees no my fault eef you esometimes find yourself een trouble because of thees, okay?
Tuppence
	I thought we parted with Dwight back over
	at Monty's.
Tuppence
	And yet here he is back in his cave. I suppose
	you have to admire him for making that journey
	all by himself.
Bianca
	You shouldn't tease him like that, %a000090! Surely he can come along?
Nera
	If the wagon was full, he'd end up having to go to Monty's, though.
Nera
	Do you think he'd really be alright with that?
Bianca
	What is it about caves? They're always so cold and damp, the whole world over.
Bianca
	You en't never spent a long stretch of time livin' in one place, right, %a000090?
Bianca
	Nope, you've bin on the road for pretty much all your life so far.
Bianca
	Eh? You lived at the Crocodilopolis? Ha! You can hardly call that livin'! ...Sorry. I didn't mean to bring back bad memories.
Bianca
	We should get a wriggle on to Nadiria if we're done and dusted here.
Bianca
	We're the sort of guardians of the legendary
	hero, after all. It wouldn't do for us to distract
	him too much.
Nera
	It's good to be able to walk around without fear in such a dank, cold place, isn't it?
Nera
	Waah!
Nera
	Sorry! There was some kind of furry insect by my foot. It took me by surprise, that's all.
Nera
	We should really try to move on if you're ready to, darling. We don't have much time.
%0%a001240
	You came here when you were little, right, Dad?
	With that faerie friend of yours.
%0%a001240
	You're so lucky! It'd be so much fun to go off adventuring with a faerie.
%0%a001240
	Now we're here, we should explore every nook and cranny. I want to see everything you saw when you were here last.
%0%a001240
	So this is where you came to find ⓗLots about Locksⓘ...
%0%a001240
	If only you still had the book with you now.
	I'd love to know what was in it.
%0%a001250
	I thought this cave would be so much nicer, what with it being in the Faerie Realm and everything.
%0%a001250
	I imagined flowers all over the walls, and lots of shiny things everywhere. Hmph.
%0%a001250
	I've never got lost in a cave before.
%0%a001250
	But %a001240 gets lost all the time. He just wanders on in without giving any thought to how to get back out again.
%0%a001250
	Whenever I walk through a cave, I always wonder what would happen if the sun suddenly shone right into the middle of it.
%0%a001250
	It would certainly give everyone a shock,
	wouldn't it?
Sancho
	Ah, ees another cave. Sí, sí...
	When I travelled weeth señor Pankraz, we explored een many, many caves.
Sancho
	You know, ees no eso easy to take a young bebé weeth you when you are travelling.
	Sí, señor Pankraz, he was eso tough. Eso macho.
Sancho
	Esometimes now, friend, you look just like your father, señor Pankraz.
Sancho
	Sí. You have grown eento a fine man now, My Majesty.
Sancho
	Ees no good to be een a cave like thees where ees no action, you know. I estart to chatter like the castanets.
Tuppence
	The monsters around here are rather puny.
	I could fight these fellows off with one hand
	tied behind my back!
Tuppence
	I wouldn't turn down a bit of assistance if things took a dangerous turn, mind you.
Tuppence
	There don't appear to be any faeries here.
	Shall we be heading off, then?
Nera
	I'm afraid I'm probably causing Mama and Papa no end of worry.
Nera
	Darling, I don't suppose it would be possible to take the occasional detour to Mostroferrato to put their minds at ease, would it?
Debora
	Knowing Papa, he'd worry himself so much that he'd be too tense to die! I am a bit concerned about Mama, though.
Debora
	We should stop by in Mostroferrato every once in a while, %a000090.
Debora
	It's good news as far as I'm concerned.
	Characters like him make perfect servants if you train them right.
Debora
	How annoying! I was looking forward to putting him into shape. You'll have to sort something out, %a000090.
Debora
	So that's one more servant along for the ride.
	I'm quite looking forward to seeing what he can do.
Debora
	How annoying! I was looking forward to having another servant on board. You'll have to sort something out, %a000090.
Debora
	He's obviously not a graduate of the charm school, is he? He's got potential, though. Let him join us, %a000090.
Debora
	I think he could be a good learner. It would've been a shame not to take him on.
Debora
	We still haven't finished training him up as a decent servant, so we'd better take him along.
Debora
	There's no reason for us to be here, is there?
Debora
	I'd say there isn't, so let's head back outside.
	I've never liked caves much.
Debora
	Waah!
Debora
	Wh-What are you thinking, %a000090?
	Don't just start talking at me like that!
	You made me jump.
