Bianca
	Do you think that big boat over there is the Ventuno casino ship Briscoletti was on about?
Bianca
	I wonder if the whole boat has bin made into a casino. This could be fun! Come on, let's go and
	see what's what.
Nera
	It was all so busy when we were here for our wedding. I hope you'll be able to enjoy looking
	around a bit more today.
Bianca
	Yeah, you need a fair bit of cash before you can really have a good go at gamblin'. Otherwise it's
	all over in an instant.
Bianca
	Part of me wants to go a bit wild, what with it bein' our honeymoon. But I know we need to be sensible about the future too.
Nera
	I think you can still have fun with a small amount of money, as long as you set your sights accordingly.
Bianca
	I wonder what her story is. D'you think she's got some kind of problem?
Nera
	She wants to go on board the Ventuno, and yet
	she can't. You can really sense the sadness in
	that poor woman.
Bianca
	Come on! What are we waitin' for?
Nera
	Mind how you go when you step onto the pontoon, won't you, darling?
Bianca
	Huh. He's probably right, but he en't exactly got a nice way of puttin' it, eh?
Nera
	I wonder if that fellow spends all his time there, teasing the casino customers like that.
Bianca
	But she's not actually on the ship!
	...Or is that splittin' hairs?
Nera
	What a strange occupation it is just to be standing there like that all the time.
Bianca
	What a huge ship! It's much bigger than the boat Briscoletti give us, eh?
Nera
	I'm not very familiar with the layout of the ship, either. So we can explore it together.
Bianca
	So this was Briscoletti's own idea, eh?
	Pretty impressive stuff.
Nera
	I knew Papa was a big fan of this place, but I had no idea that it was his creation.
Nera
	He must have set it up during the time I was away at the abbey.
Bianca
	Yeah, I might end up feelin' a bit dicky myself.
	I'm sure I'd feel better if I won, mind!
Nera
	Maybe the rocking about would put you into a kind of trance and you'd end up winning at the slot machines without even trying!
Bianca
	Briscoletti must be pretty loaded to be able to employ someone like him all the way out here, eh?
Nera
	Casinos do have a tendency to get rather wild. It's important to make sure the customers are safe.
Bianca
	Let's just forget about everythin' else while we're here and have a good time, eh, %a000090?
Nera
	We are on our honeymoon, I suppose. It can't hurt to let down our hair a little bit and have some fun.
Bianca
	A weddin' on a boat, eh? Still, our weddin' was nicer than anyone's, I reckon!
Nera
	I think we were the first couple to be married here. And I know we're going to be really happy.
Bianca
	I s'pose sailors have to work shifts so there's always someone on duty at any time of day.
	Looks like pretty hard work.
Nera
	Oops! Looks like we've invaded the sailors' quarters.
Bianca
	Yeah, if only we could get in the kind of wins we expected, eh?
Nera
	Papa did something to the slot machines because he says it's boring if casinos pay out too predictably.
Bianca
	Yeah, you'll have to make sure you dun't get too carried away, eh? Still, I'm here lookin' over your shoulder, so you should be okay.
Nera
	I wonder which one of them is her husband.
Bianca
	D'you think he'd really be havin' fun if he lost, then?
Nera
	That's exactly right. It's probably a good idea to
	find something to do that will lift your spirits
	when you lose.
Bianca
	I s'pose the place does need a captain, bein' a boat and all.
Nera
	He really doesn't take no for an answer. It can be quite embarrassing at times.
Bianca
	That is pretty impressive, but you've bin through at least ten times that many fights, eh, %a000090?
Nera
	............
Nera
	I think you're much more accomplished than that.
Bianca
	It does seem a bit frivolous to be travellin' about for fun in this day and age.
Nera
	She must be a strong woman to be travelling about under these circumstances.
Bianca
	Blimey! You wouldn't have thought they'd have rooms this grand on a ship, eh, %a000090?
Nera
	I've come to like the sea since we started our journey together, %a000090. It's wonderful to look at the stars from onboard a ship.
Nera
	He he he! It was like sleeping in a big rocking cradle last night, wasn't it, darling?
Bianca
	That was the best night's sleep I've had in ages.
	You were out for the count as well, %a000090.
Bianca
	What a dance! If any bloke fancied a closer look at the footwork, she'd knock him for six no trouble!
Nera
	I wouldn't get too close if I were you, otherwise you might get kicked too.
Bianca
	You can see right up everyone's nostrils when they crane their necks up at the stage like that. Yuck!
Nera
	The dance is thrilling, indeed, but I think the outfits might be even more so!
Bianca
	Maybe I should give it a go, eh?
Bianca
	Ha ha! Only jokin'!
Nera
	If only I had the courage to dance in front of people like they do.
Bianca
	Maybe I should get a job here if ever we run out of money then, eh?
Nera
	It's a terrible thing that young girls have to do work like this just for the money.
Nera
	But with Papa running the place, I'm sure it's a lot more highbrow than other establishments.
Bianca
	I wonder if that's what happens to you if you end up doin' that kind of job too long.
Nera
	People say that women become more beautiful if they're looked at with appreciation. It makes me
	feel all embarrassed, though.
Bianca
	Do you reckon she's new here? She seems a bit unsure of herself.
Nera
	One, two... One and two...
Nera
	I can have a little go at dancing here because no one can really see me.
Bianca
	All these dancin' girls make themselves up the same way, so it's hard to tell 'em apart!
Nera
	Oh! I think that girl was at the abbey when I was!
	No, I must be imagining it.
Bianca
	Watch where you're treadin', %a000090! Are you tryin' to get yourself in trouble or somethin'?
Bianca
	Huh! If it's trouble you're after, I'll give you plenty if you're not careful!
Bianca
	Hmmm...
	Are you sure about that?
Nera
	Darling...
	Did you tread on that girl's foot?
Nera
	How rude!
Nera
	Good. I'm not sure I'd like to be married to the kind of man who goes around treading on people's toes.
Bianca
	I get it. But I'm not sure he'll catch any cheats standin' there.
Nera
	Does that mean you can cheat at the casino, then?
Nera
	Hmm, I've no idea how.
Bianca
	If he reckons he knows so much, why dun't he get up an' 'ave a go then, eh?
Nera
	That man was rather opinionated, wasn't he? It sounded as if he knew what he was talking about, though.
Bianca
	Ha ha! I wish I could've seen him get hit, that would've bin funny!
Nera
	He must've been trying to get a very close-up view for that to happen.
Bianca
	Does that mean this boat belongs to Briscoletti, then? That bloke's got it made, eh?
Nera
	Papa donated some money to the abbey I stayed
	at too.
Nera
	But I asked Abbess Abovall to treat me just like everyone else regardless, which was nice.
Bianca
	He seems a bit shook up, eh? It can be a bit of a blow when you lose, I s'pose.
Nera
	Papa often used to say it's a good idea to pray to the Goddess before you end up losing too much.
Bianca
	Yeah, I'll bet. He certainly en't gettin' his money together by defeatin' monsters.
Nera
	Yes, well, I've never really thought about that before. I wonder how everyone's getting on.
Bianca
	Typical! There's all them desperate, greedy people
	out there, and then someone like her comes along
	and wins!
Nera
	She's lucky that she won without even trying. I just hope she doesn't end up addicted as a result. That wouldn't be so lucky.
Bianca
	Now I'm jealous! We could do with a win like that.
Nera
	The problem with winning is that it's hard to know where to draw the line.
Bianca
	Yeah, but ten thousand can turn into a hundred,
	and a hundred can turn into one too. It works
	both ways.
Nera
	We'll have to keep steadily building up our tokens, just like he said.
Bianca
	That's the first time I've seen a priest in a casino!
	I wonder if the Goddess'll answer his prayers.
Nera
	Surely it's not the done thing to waste a prayer to the Goddess on such a thing! I certainly wouldn't
	do it.
Bianca
	It's bigger than I expected. Looks like we could have a lot of fun here!
Nera
	Where do we start? I quite like going for Double or Nothing at the poker table myself.
Bianca
	That was a stroke of luck! I wonder why no one else spotted it, though. It's so shiny that it's pretty hard to miss.
Nera
	How fortunate! Maybe we're having a bit of a
	lucky streak.
Bianca
	Dun't look like they've got any of the special Zoomshine, though, eh? Life is but a drink...ha ha ha!
Nera
	Oh yes! These are all Papa's favourite drinks!
Bianca
	They've even got a T 'n' T board! This ship's just one big fun palace, eh?
Nera
	You're probably surprised to see a T 'n' T board here, right? I know I am!
Bianca
	Yeah, you can never get as far as you think you can. It's a tricky old game.
Nera
	Yes, you have to keep checking your position and figuring out the best route forward. It's not easy.
Bianca
	I dun't remember the ship rockin' all that much,
	do you?
Nera
	There were probably times when the boat rocking worked in his favour as well, though.
Bianca
	Yeah, and you can't buy the tickets, neither, so you have to think pretty hard before you use them all up.
Nera
	That reminds me. I heard once about a T 'n' T free pass that lets you play as many times as you like.
Bianca
	Nope. I could never just laze about havin' fun if there were things to be won.
Nera
	I don't think I think too much.
	So I win some and I lose some.
Bianca
	So this is where the casino prizes are kept? Ooh! Gimme, gimme, gimme!
Bianca
	Yeah!
Bianca
	Oh.
Nera
	It looks like I'd be in a lot of trouble if I messed with anything here, no matter that I'm a Briscoletti myself!
Bianca
	There's certainly a lot of gear in here. Looks like everyone must've come to stay for a while, eh?
Nera
	It's as if people are planning on staying as long as it takes to have a big win, don't you think?
Bianca
	He may not go off playin' in the casino, but surely sleepin' on the job is just as bad!
Nera
	Sailors like him have people's lives in their hands, so you'd really hope for a little more care to be taken.
Bianca
	I s'pose it would be pretty nice gettin' married
	here, but it'd be tricky to get your guests to come
	all this way.
Nera
	I was only ever allowed in my own room and out on deck when I rode on ships with Papa.
Nera
	I had no idea that he felt so strongly
	about it, though.
Bianca
	That's a fair old load of cookin' utensils there, eh? You could make anythin' you liked with them.
Nera
	Mmm, what a lovely smell! I'm starting to feel a bit hungry now.
Bianca
	Do you think that big boat over there is the Ventuno casino ship Briscoletti was on about?
Bianca
	I wonder if the whole boat has bin made into a casino. This could be fun! Come on, let's go and
	see what's what.
Nera
	It was all so busy when we were here for our wedding. I hope you'll be able to enjoy looking
	around a bit more today.
Bianca
	Yeah, the casino can almost be a bit romantic of a night. Perfect for honeymooners, eh?
Nera
	She's resting here? Do you think she lost all her money and can't afford to pay for an inn?
Bianca
	Come on! What are we waitin' for?
Nera
	Mind how you go when you step onto the pontoon, won't you, darling?
Bianca
	Maybe I should make a wish too. I wish I'll spend the rest of my life with %a000090!
Nera
	I've wished upon a star more times than I can count.
Nera
	I always wished that I'd find the boy I once met on Papa's ship again.
Bianca
	En't it a bit sad drinkin' on your own like that?
Nera
	Well, we're enjoying a nice walk under the stars, aren't we, darling?
Bianca
	So they dun't sail this ship no more, eh?
Nera
	How sweet! It must take a lot of dedication to become a ship's captain.
Bianca
	Blimey! It's all go for him whether he's awake or asleep, eh?
Nera
	He must be a keen gambler to be fretting about it in his sleep!
Bianca
	He's in a bit of a state, eh?
Nera
	That poor man! He seems rather disturbed.
Bianca
	Fair enough. I'd prefer to just get a bit of
	fresh air, personally.
Nera
	Maybe we should have a little dance once we've finished playing, then?
Bianca
	Brrr. His eyes are really scary.
Nera
	People can get far too wound up by the whole
	casino experience. It should just be about having
	a bit of fun.
Bianca
	What a funny old man! I hope he dun't hurt himself with that kind of carry on!
Nera
	He he he! He obviously doesn't like to be beaten,
	does he?
Bianca
	Yeah. I wonder why the sea air makes everythin'
	so sticky.
Nera
	Yes, she seems a sticky character, that's for sure. Sorry... I was just making a joke.
Bianca
	It's hard work tryin' to sleep durin' the day.
	I much prefer sleepin' of a night.
Nera
	He seems a reliable sort.
	I'm sure the ship's safe in his hands.
Bianca
	He en't got a bad voice, but I dun't have a clue what them lyrics are all about.
Nera
	What a voice! He certainly knows how to command everyone's attention.
Bianca
	His voice is hardly high-pitched, eh?
Nera
	Um... Moonwort bulb can be great for stopping
	the wobbles!
Bianca
	He may not look the part, but it's his job to be on the lookout for cheats, eh?
Nera
	The atmosphere certainly is relaxed. It's rather romantic, in fact...
Bianca
	I think we'd prob'ly better leave him be.
Nera
	There can only be one reason for being miserable in a place like this. He's obviously lost all his money and can't afford to travel home.
Bianca
	It en't a bad voice, that's for sure. It certainly gives the place a unique kind of atmosphere.
Nera
	It's amazing to see how people are so enthralled with this man's singing. I wonder if he's famous.
Bianca
	I didn't know priests gambled. He seems a bit hooked, actually. Do you think that's okay?
Nera
	I suppose priests are people too. It can't hurt for him to have a little bit of fun.
Bianca
	The idea of a floatin' casino is all well and good, but it's a bit of a pain for people to get to.
Nera
	This is a lovely spot. And the island's nice too, with its lovely crescent shape. Just like a new moon!
Bianca
	There's no point hangin' around a T 'n' T board if you en't got no T 'n' T tickets.
Nera
	Oh dear. He won't be able to play any more, then.
Bianca
	I never heard of that before. Crikey! A free pass to T 'n' T would be like a dream come true, eh?
Nera
	I've heard about that. Yes, the T 'n' T free pass,
	it's called.
Bianca
	I can think of better ways to go down in history, thank you very much!
Nera
	Don't worry. The sea around here isn't very deep, so there's nothing for us to sink in.
Bianca
	What a poor excuse for a sailor!
	...We won't sink, will we!?
Nera
	I can't swim either. You'll have to rescue me if it ever comes to it, okay?
Bianca
	Fancy sayin' that in his sleep! He really is a shirker!
Nera
	I'm afraid that chap's likely to lose his job before long if he's not careful.
Bianca
	Now that's dedication, dreamin' about cookin' even in your sleep!
Nera
	I find cooking really good fun. It's always so exciting to see how things turn out.
Debora
	I didn't have the chance to play at the casino when we were here for our wedding, so I'm really going to have some fun today.
Debora
	Poor people are so boring! I don't want you guarding the purse strings. Spend as much as it takes!
Debora
	Sounds like she'd like to be aboard herself.
	She'll just have to make do with being close by instead.
Debora
	You know, they usually charge people just for getting on the pontoon. But I did some name-dropping and mentioned Papa, so we got on for free.
Debora
	%0%a000090! I hope you're not going to show me up!
Debora
	Work? I'd hardly call it work. Looks to me like those bunny girls just stand about the place the whole time.
Debora
	Papa's not here today, so we can really go to town and have some fun!
Debora
	I heard that Papa had this place built back when Nera was away at the abbey.
Debora
	And as I remember it, Mama refused to speak to him for about three days when she found out!
Debora
	It's easy to forget about the motion if you put your mind to it.
Debora
	Everyone that comes here is really rich, so it would be bad news if anything untoward happened.
Debora
	Absolutely! We should make the most of it and really enjoy ourselves while we're here.
Debora
	Indeed. Except your promise to me was more one of eternal devotion than love.
Debora
	What have you brought me to this filthy hole for? We're supposed to be here to have fun.
Debora
	Papa said something once about how he'd fixed it so wins on the slot machines couldn't be predicted.
Debora
	I'll never tell you that you can't visit a casino.
Debora
	I will tell you that you have to take me with you, though!
Debora
	Good fun? There's nothing fun about being a loser.
Debora
	Yep, once Papa makes his mind up about something, there's absolutely no changing it.
Debora
	Only five? That's hardly worth boasting about.
Debora
	Sounds like she enjoys her travels. There's no sign of a husband with her, though.
Debora
	There wouldn't be anything elegant about it if she ate too much and then felt seasick!
Debora
	That bed was so comfortable!
	Trust Papa to get it just right.
Debora
	She must be really into her dancing.
Debora
	Watch it, %a000090! I don't like the way you're staring.
Debora
	Can I keep up? Ha! I could give her a run for her money if I wanted to.
Debora
	I wonder just how much Papa is paying these girls.
Debora
	I don't blame her. I always find it really irritating when men make it so obvious they can't take their eyes off me.
Debora
	She's obviously new. She's totally out of synch with the other girls.
Debora
	All of these dancing girls wear such heavy make-up.
Debora
	I suppose it's because they don't have the natural beauty I have.
Debora
	You didn't tread on that girl's foot then, did you?
Debora
	Tsk! You're a disgrace.
	I can't take you anywhere.
Debora
	I wonder... Wimp that you are, you always go red when you tell a lie, so it's a bit of a giveaway.
Debora
	If he's supposed to be on the lookout for cheats, then what's he been doing staring at the stage all
	the time?
Debora
	I hardly think he's in a position to pass judgement on the dancing! I'm sure they can dance a lot better than he can.
Debora
	Serves him right for getting too close.
Debora
	I never knew Papa did that.
Debora
	Quick, let's get away from him!
	Bad luck can be catching, you know.
Debora
	Yes, no matter how many times I ask Papa why he's so rich he won't tell me.
Debora
	So she managed to win even though she doesn't know how to play? Some people have all the luck.
Debora
	Your luck in a casino can run out just as quickly as it comes.
Debora
	Don't you go being stingy over each and every coin, will you? You have to spend money to make money!
Debora
	I wouldn't mind worshipping the Goddess if she granted prayers like winning at the casino!
Debora
	What shall we start with? I like going for broke on the poker table myself.
Debora
	It seems a bit desperate, picking up tokens from the floor like that.
Debora
	It's true. I've seen Papa drinking all of these.
Debora
	I can't believe Papa even built a T 'n' T board here!
Debora
	It's better just to go for it and see what happens rather than trying to plan a route. You never know your luck!
Debora
	We'd better watch out for that when we're rolling too.
Debora
	I wonder who makes T 'n' T tickets anyway.
Debora
	Precisely! It's better just to go with your gut.
	That's the way to win, if you ask me.
Debora
	As if I would! How dare he insinuate such a thing!
Debora
	It looks like some people have moved here permanently, what with all this luggage.
Debora
	He's got some nerve slacking off from his work so blatantly right in front of me!
Debora
	He's probably the reason Papa didn't want me down here.
Debora
	Well, they're all rich folk, so I suppose they're bound to be quite fussy when it comes to their food.
Debora
	I didn't have the chance to play at the casino when we were here for our wedding, so I'm really going to have some fun today.
Debora
	She's going on about the Ventuno at night, but what would she know about it from being stood here?
Debora
	You usually have to make a reservation to get on the pontoon, but they're letting you on because you're with me.
Debora
	Wishing upon a star?
	Waste of time if you ask me.
Debora
	Mmm, sounds nice. You look like you'd prefer a decent meal to a flute of champagne, mind you.
Debora
	Come to think of it, are you filling out our ship's log properly every day?
Debora
	I've never seen you doing it.
	Why the secrecy?
Debora
	What!? Who do you expect to do it if you don't?
Debora
	Huh! You'd just better make sure you do it from now on.
Debora
	Imagine the disappointment if you dreamt you'd had a big win and then woke up to find it was just a dream!
Debora
	What a fool! Surely he could've stopped before he ended up that bad.
Debora
	When I need to unwind, I find a good bit of shopping works much better than any gentle dancing could.
Debora
	Ah, but the problem with that philosophy is that tomorrow never comes.
Debora
	He certainly doesn't look like he's up to it nowadays.
Debora
	The sea air is just terrible for messing up my hair.
	I'll never get on with it.
Debora
	Um, isn't he the only one in charge?
	What happens to the ship when he sleeps?
Debora
	What a weird little ditty he's singing!
Debora
	I always prefer men with nice, deep voices, personally.
Debora
	I know it's his job, but he's the one ruining the atmosphere if you ask me.
Debora
	He's obviously gone and lost all his money and now he can't afford the fare home.
Debora
	Why don't you give us a tune, %a000090?
	On second thoughts, maybe not.
Debora
	Are priests even allowed in casinos?
Debora
	I wonder if they'll put the Ventuno out to sea once it's peaceful again.
Debora
	It'd make it a bit awkward to get to, though.
Debora
	You're good for T 'n' T tickets, right, %a000090?
Debora
	You'll be in a lot of trouble if you tell me now we don't have any and I can't play!
Debora
	Yes, the free pass. I remember Papa talking
	about that.
Debora
	Hmph! It's bad luck to even say things like that when you're on a boat.
Debora
	Why would anyone become a sailor if they couldn't swim? I'd find another job if I was him.
Debora
	Maybe I should tell Papa and have him fired.
Debora
	Maybe we should sample some of his food if it's that perfect. You can try it first, though, and make sure it's good enough for me.
