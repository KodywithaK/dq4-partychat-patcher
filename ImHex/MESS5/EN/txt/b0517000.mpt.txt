Bianca
	That bloke's veggies taste amazin'. We have him deliver 'em to our place, and they're great!
Nera
	I love outdoor baths like this. Maybe we could have a soak together a little bit later?
Nera
	Ooh, that'll be nice. With any luck, we might even have the place to ourselves.
Nera
	Oh! There's no need to be shy around me, you know.
Bianca
	That bloke may moan, but what his son's doin' is probably a big help.
Nera
	Ooh! A priest. I probably would've become a
	nun myself if I hadn't had Rodrigo Briscoletti
	for a father.
Bianca
	Ha ha ha! I hadn't realised you was walkin'
	around with such a beamin' smile on your
	face, %a000090!
Nera
	It makes me really happy to see you so pleased that we're married, darling.
Bianca
	That cat's not exactly a pet of ours, but it seems to like hangin' around our place all the time.
Bianca
	Come to think of it, I wonder how %a001210's gettin' along.
Nera
	I wonder if this cat belongs to Bianca.
	It really is very sweet.
Bianca
	Just because it's a mixed bath, it dun't mean people shouldn't observe some kind of limits!
Nera
	Now I feel all embarrassed too. Let's hurry up and get away from here.
Bianca
	Oh, I see. So that's the way it is then, eh?
Nera
	Oh! You do like your jokes, don't you, %a000090? He he he!
Bianca
	We moved here to Stockenbarrel because we thought the bath water might do Dad some good.
Bianca
	It seems to have worked too. He's much better now than he was.
Nera
	You can't beat the feeling of a nice outdoor bath. Being here with you only makes it all the better.
Bianca
	I wonder how Dad's doin'. Maybe we could drop in on him after, eh? I should try and show me face a bit more often really.
Bianca
	Once we're done with all our travellin', it might be quite nice to settle down here, eh? If you like the idea too, of course.
Nera
	Don't worry about me. I don't mind at all if you'd like to go and see how Bianca is doing.
Nera
	You were childhood friends after all, so I know she means a lot to you.
Nera
	This village is so lovely and quiet. Blissful!
Bianca
	The bloke here's the one who made the veil for the weddin', eh?
Bianca
	It wasn't half pretty. I had no idea he could make somethin' so lovely.
Nera
	That wonderful veil I wore at our wedding was made here, wasn't it?
Nera
	It's funny. He doesn't seem like the kind of fellow to take on work like that, and yet he made such a lovely job of it.
Bianca
	Oh yeah. I remember one of the villagers headin' off to join up with that religion a while back.
	I wonder how they're gettin' on.
Nera
	Dear me, this White King's Paradise sounds a bit grand for mere humans to be building.
Bianca
	It's a bit of a pain havin' to traipse past the inn to get to the baths.
Bianca
	But they're the ones takin' care of them, so I s'pose it's fair enough.
Nera
	What a lovely inn this is, with the baths nearby and everything. It's certainly nice and relaxing.
Bianca
	There's somethin' about goin' into a pub durin' the day. It always seems quieter than everywhere else, dun't you think?
Nera
	I'm surprised to find a pub in a small village like
	this. I suppose it's a good place for people to relax after work.
Bianca
	The White King's Paradise? That sounds a bit serious. This kind of talk really gives me the willies for some reason.
Nera
	This White King's Paradise must be rather special
	for people to abandon their family and friends to
	go there.
Bianca
	I know it'll be time for the off again soon, but have a rest here first, eh?
Nera
	I feel a bit awkward getting in the way here when Bianca's not around.
Bianca
	If we're stayin' here tonight, let's get a room at the inn, eh?
Bianca
	I'd feel all funny sharin' a room with you at
	Dad's place.
Nera
	Are we staying here in the village tonight?
Nera
	I think I'd feel a bit strange sleeping by your side with Bianca so nearby.
Bianca
	Ha ha ha! I hadn't realised you was walkin'
	around with such a beamin' smile on your
	face, %a000090!
Nera
	It makes me really happy to see you so pleased that we're married, darling.
Bianca
	If only he wasn't around, we'd have the place to ourselves, eh?
Nera
	There are actually quite a few people about, and yet he doesn't seem to feel at all self-conscious about washing his back like that.
Nera
	I could wash your back if only we had the place to ourselves. It's so nice and muscular!
Bianca
	Blimey! He's even made veils for royalty, then?
	And for your dad, of all people!
Nera
	It really was an exquisite veil. I sometimes fetch it out and gaze at it in wonder even now.
Bianca
	Ha ha! There you go again, tryin' to speak to folk when they're sleepin'! You're a funny one sometimes, %a000090.
Nera
	He really is fast asleep. It must be tiring work trying to grow things day in day out.
Bianca
	That woman always stays up into the night until her old man comes home.
Bianca
	She makes all this fuss and moans about him
	bein' late, but I think she's just anxious
	when he's not around.
Nera
	I think it's nice that she stays awake and waits for her husband to come home like that.
Bianca
	Those girls certainly seem to be gettin' in a
	decent rest.
Nera
	You shouldn't really be bothering people when they're asleep, you know, %a000090. I think we should leave them alone.
Bianca
	There only ever used to be old folk comin' to the baths here, but it seems like they're popular with all the young girls just lately.
Nera
	We mustn't disturb their beauty sleep, darling.
Bianca
	He really seems to have a thing for me, that one. Shame I couldn't ever repay the favour.
Bianca
	You're the only one for me, see, %a000090. Always have bin, always will be.
Nera
	I do hope Bianca will live happily ever after too.
Bianca
	Oh yeah. I remember one of the villagers headin' off to join up with that religion a while back. I hope they're okay.
Nera
	I wonder who started a rumour like that.
	And, more importantly, why.
Bianca
	You've seen my house, right? That bloke had it up in no time!
Bianca
	Suddenly carpenterin' is more fun than
	it sounds!
Nera
	Oh! Another admirer of Bianca's, by the sounds of it.
Bianca
	You can hardly blame his missus for bein' angry. He'll be no good to anyone after ten glasses!
Nera
	I do hope I never have to shout at you like she's going to shout at her hubbie when he gets home.
Nera
	I suppose that means you'll just have to make sure you never do anything that warrants any shouting. He he he!
Bianca
	That little one's always asleep here of a night. I wonder what it is about our house that it likes so much.
Bianca
	That scintillating sinter he was on about is the crystal deposits left behind in the bath water. It's all natural stuff, and there's not a lot of it.
Bianca
	It's the most famous thing about Stockenbarrel by far.
Nera
	Oh yes. Stockenbarrel is famous for its
	scintillating sinter.
Nera
	I think it's quite a valuable thing, in fact. I wonder if that man's from around these parts. It doesn't seem like he is.
Bianca
	Huh! No wonder it's bin so tricky findin' any scintillatin' sinter lately. That bloke's got it all!
Nera
	Scintillating sinter has a lovely, distinct smell to it.
Bianca
	If he's that fussed about the outside world,
	then why dun't he get out of this well?
Bianca
	Maybe that's why he was after the scintillatin' sinter all the while.
Nera
	I could be wrong, but is that fellow stuck down here, do you think?
Bianca
	He comes across as a bit of a dirty old man,
	that one. But I'm sure he means well deep down.
Bianca
	That woman's bin like one of the family to Dad and me ever since we arrived here in Stockenbarrel.
Bianca
	With Mum gone, it was nice to have her
	about, treatin' me like I was her real daughter
	and everythin'.
Bianca
	What's wrong, %a000090? You look a bit fed up. Not jealous, are you?
Bianca
	Ha ha ha! You dun't have to worry. It en't like that with me and him. Not at all.
Bianca
	Hmmm. You sure about that?
Bianca
	How embarrassin'!
Bianca
	Still, it's good to know he's feelin' better now.
	That's one less thing to worry about.
Bianca
	He dun't always say the right thing, but I used to think he's not all that bad deep down. Maybe I was wrong, though...
Bianca
	Looks like Dad's asleep. I hope he's back in good health again soon.
Nera
	Why are you being so quiet all of a sudden?
	...Surely not!?
Nera
	That's a shame. Oh! You don't think that means she's gone out of the village alone, do you?
Nera
	Looks like we won't be able to see her until tonight.
	I wonder where she's gone off to.
Nera
	It sounds like Bianca's father really thought highly of Pankraz. He seems to be in rather a bad way, doesn't he?
Nera
	You don't think he's feeling so ill because of
	the stress of you not marrying Bianca, do you?
	I hope not!
Nera
	All men seem to love Bianca, young and old.
	It's not hard to see why.
Nera
	Bianca seems well.
Nera
	I'll be sure to make you happy, %a000090.
	Just as happy as she would!
Bianca
	This is where that mate of yours lives, en't it? Harry, I mean.
Bianca
	We en't got time for visitin' now, though. We need to find that Circle of Water.
Bianca
	Socialisin' with your mates will have to wait, %a000090. We've got stuff to be doin'.
Bianca
	It feels funny bein' here.
Bianca
	It's a bit scary to think that this is the place responsible for all that damage done to Whealbrook all them years ago.
Bianca
	Harry and Maria were there at our wedding, weren't they? We should go and drop in on them.
Bianca
	I know things have bin a bit rocky here in the past, but it all seems nice and peaceful now.
Nera
	This is the place where Harry's brother is on the throne, isn't it?
Nera
	I heard all sorts of nasty rumours about this place when I was at the abbey. It's good to see it nice and peaceful now.
Bianca
	Everyone seems so happy.
Bianca
	Looks like you and I en't the only ones who've
	had a hard time of it, eh? It en't bin easy on these folk neither.
Nera
	It makes me feel all warm inside when I see people looking happy like that.
Bianca
	Ha ha! He certainly dun't mind what he tells folk, eh?
Nera
	It's not really too late for him, is it?
Nera
	Hm, I suppose maybe it is.
Nera
	I agree. It's much better for people to keep on hoping.
Bianca
	You wouldn't expect to find someone like that in
	a castle, somehow. Not that it's of any interest to
	us, mind.
Bianca
	If we keep travellin' like this, we'll probably find ourselves in Gotha sometime, eh?
Nera
	He must've been a very good craftsman indeed for talk of him to have spread this far.
Bianca
	Maybe it's because of all them years in the mountains, but I can't seem to relax in a big
	castle town like this.
Nera
	I'll do my best not to embarrass you in front of
	His Majesty.
Bianca
	If it fell from the sky, do you reckon that means anyone can get in and out of it now?
Nera
	People keep talking about a castle fallen from
	the sky, but no one ever seems to say where it actually fell.
Bianca
	Looks like you've bin a bit busy here too, eh?
	Shame I wasn't taggin' along at the time.
Nera
	It's fun listening to people talking about what you
	did here. I'm getting to know so many things I didn't know before.
Bianca
	It must be pretty amazin' for his wife to get married and become a princess all of a sudden.
Bianca
	Hmph! We should try and look happier together.
	I dun't like bein' beaten!
Nera
	We're just as happy as they are, aren't we, darling?
Bianca
	That old man is so happy. You really did a good thing here, %a000090.
Nera
	That's just...so...wonderful.
	Oh dear! Now I'm crying!
Bianca
	That all sounds a bit complicated, eh?
Nera
	I heard it was the legendary hero who defeated the monster that evolved using the Secret of Evolution.
Bianca
	You just bowl on in anywhere you like, eh, %a000090? I'd be too nervous if it was just me.
Nera
	I think I'm more uneasy about meeting the Queen Dowager than I am about meeting the King himself!
Bianca
	The Queen Dowager was slung into her own jail by an impostor, wasn't she?
Bianca
	I wonder if she was there already when the late king died.
Nera
	Your good deeds are helping out entire kingdoms, not just individual people. You really are amazing, %a000090.
Bianca
	This castle is a bit of a maze, eh?
	I'm permanently lost!
Nera
	What a big castle this is. I don't think I've ever seen a place so grand.
Bianca
	Maybe the shield he was on about is the shield you're lookin' for, eh?
Bianca
	We'd better get a move on, then. You want that shield, right, %a000090?
Bianca
	When I see you chatterin' away to the King like that, I feel like you're far too grand for the likes of me.
Nera
	We must find the legendary hero as soon as we can, so that we can rescue your poor mother.
Bianca
	So that's the famous Harry? He looks just like
	any other prince, but he's had his fair share of hardship, eh?
Bianca
	He didn't even notice me, you know.
Bianca
	Seems like he's only got eyes for that
	pretty wife of his.
Bianca
	I'm sure he's right that your mum would want you to be happy.
Bianca
	But I reckon it's up to you to decide what it is that'll make you that way.
Bianca
	Harry looks just like any other prince, but he's had his fair share of hardship, eh?
Bianca
	He didn't seem to notice me, you know. I reckon he's only got eyes for that pretty wife of his.
Nera
	Harry seems like a nice chap. I knew he would be, though, because of all you and he went through together.
Nera
	Coburg's lucky to have him. With him around,
	they have nothing to fear.
Bianca
	You never seem to want to talk much about it.
Bianca
	But I can see that an awful lot happened to you in the time we were apart.
Bianca
	I can't tell you how glad I am that you made it through everythin' alive, %a000090.
Nera
	To think Harry kept all of those feelings to himself!
Bianca
	I dunno if it's because I read that message of his, but Harry seems really special now.
Bianca
	What a great souvenir. Our weddin' souvenir dun't look like much in comparison, eh?
Nera
	I don't think I've ever seen such an exquisite
	music box.
Nera
	And it's all the better because it was made to thank people who'd come to share in their celebrations.
Bianca
	Maria is so sweet and so tidy. Not like me, eh?
Bianca
	Looks like I en't really princess material. Ha ha!
Bianca
	Sounds to me like Harry might quite like to go off on his travels again.
Bianca
	I know the timin' en't any good at the minute, but it'd be good if you two could go off on an adventure again sometime in the future, eh?
Nera
	So Maria was once at the same abbey I went to?
Nera
	What a coincidence that we'd meet here again now!
Bianca
	Looks like we can't get inside the castle of
	a night. We've got better things to be doin'
	at the moment, anyway.
Bianca
	Looks like we can't get inside the castle, eh?
	Best call it a night, then.
Nera
	Shall we stay the night here in Coburg?
Bianca
	Sounds like Harry and Maria get on pretty well.
Bianca
	Lucky things. Maybe I should get married...
	Ha ha! Only jokin'!
Nera
	The atmosphere here seems so relaxed.
	It's nice to see people looking happy.
Bianca
	Hey! A shootin' star! I could make a wish on it that you'll be nice and happy.
Nera
	The night sky always looks so beautiful when I'm with you.
Bianca
	A lot of folk seem to be comin' out with depressin' things like that just lately.
Nera
	Of all the luck! We're only just married, and yet people are saying the world's about to end already.
Bianca
	You just leap straight into marriage whether you know the person or not, eh, %a000090?
Bianca
	Do you think that bunny girl didn't even notice you had your wife standin' right next to you!?
Nera
	Was I your first love, darling?
Nera
	You were mine too. Isn't that nice?
Nera
	Oh. I see.
Bianca
	You're goin'!? Fine! I s'pose I can't stop you.
Bianca
	If you want your fortune tellin', why don't you just ask me?
Nera
	Oh, you're going to go and have your fortune told, are you?
Nera
	You will take me with you, won't you? He he.
Bianca
	Well, what were you expectin' to happen when you got your fortune told, eh?
Nera
	It's nice to see someone so devoted to their work.
Bianca
	Blimey! This takes me back! It must be seven
	years since I was last here. It's good to see it
	en't changed much.
Bianca
	Thanks for bringin' me back here, %a000090.
	It's nice to see the old place again.
Bianca
	But you've got more important things to be doin'.
	We should get a move on.
Bianca
	My family en't around here any more, but it's still nice to be back for a while.
Bianca
	I've got a lot of memories of this place. Remember when we rescued little %a001210 from them kids bullyin' him by the pond?
Nera
	Roundbeck's a lovely little town. It's just so relaxed.
Bianca
	That Zoom spell of yours is a bit of a bonus, eh? You can get from one place to another in no time at all.
Nera
	So this is the place Bianca grew up in, is it?
Bianca
	He must've bin pretty brave to run away from Coburg back in the day.
Bianca
	He's obviously grown up a lot since them days as a kid when he was pickin' on %a001210 all the while.
Nera
	Soldiers who escaped from Coburg in those days were executed if they were caught. He's lucky to be alive.
Bianca
	I remember him! He's one of the ones who used to pick on %a001210 all them years ago!
Nera
	The people here don't seem to have heard of the hand you had in things, do they? He he!
Bianca
	I dun't remember anyone here knowin'
	about legends. Hmm...
Nera
	It's surprising to see how far and wide rumours of the legendary weapons and armour have spread.
Bianca
	I didn't think there'd be anyone here who'd remember me any more. It's nice to see the old stick.
Nera
	So this is the house Bianca grew up in.
Bianca
	It's nice to be back again, but we dun't have time to hang about. We'd better get goin'.
Bianca
	Bein' here reminds me of Mum, so I feel a bit
	fragile. And on top of that, you're goin' off and gettin' married...
Bianca
	Blimey! What am I on about!? I blame you for bringin' me here and gettin' me all emotional!
Bianca
	It's great to see the place lookin' so good. They're really workin' hard to keep it nice, eh?
Bianca
	Bein' here really reminds me of Mum.
Bianca
	She was always such a strong woman. It was a
	real shock when that illness wiped her out all
	of a sudden.
Nera
	What a delightful little inn. You can really see how it's a labour of love for the owners.
Bianca
	What a great smell! How funny that Mum's grapes ended up bein' Roundbeck's big local speciality!
Nera
	That smell relaxes you in an instant. I think it could send me to sleep right in the middle of the day!
Bianca
	Looks like she dun't remember me. I s'pose I've changed quite a lot since then because I was just
	a kid.
Bianca
	This place is full of memories too. Remember all the times we played hide and seek here?
Bianca
	You always used to go and hide in the bath. It was dead easy to find you!
Bianca
	Oh well. I s'pose you were only really young
	back then.
Bianca
	It's a shame you never got to try any of
	Mum's grapes.
Nera
	You must have a lot of memories of this place, %a000090. I can't help feeling a little bit jealous.
Bianca
	So there's someone here who's in the know, eh? We should go and pick his brains.
Nera
	Pubs always seem to be great places for picking
	up information. We should go and see what he
	has to say.
Bianca
	As far as I remember, that bloke always used to be boozin' away.
Bianca
	I'm surprised he knows anythin' about the legendary hero. Do you reckon we can trust what he says?
Nera
	I think there are probably descendants of the legendary hero out there somewhere too. Hopefully we'll find one of them before long.
Bianca
	I appreciate you bringin' me back here, %a000090, but we en't really got time for a detour.
Bianca
	Can we stay here tonight, %a000090?
Bianca
	Great. We can cuddle up all snug.
Bianca
	Ohhhh!
Bianca
	Walkin' around here like this reminds me of the time we went on our ghost-bustin' trip. That was a bit scary, eh?
Nera
	You must be tired now too. Why don't we stay here for the night?
Bianca
	Yeah. I dun't know that I'd be too happy about makin' that journey on my own neither.
Nera
	Yes, the town may be safe now, but the surroundings certainly aren't. I wonder
	when we'll finally be granted true peace.
Bianca
	Communicatin' with monsters? That sounds just like you, %a000090!
Nera
	Maybe you're a descendant of this clan, %a000090? You seem to have some kind of power to talk to monsters.
Bianca
	We should get some rest now too.
	Tomorrow's comin', after all.
Nera
	Life couldn't be more joyous, as far as I'm concerned. Not now I'm with you.
Bianca
	I didn't think there'd be anyone here who'd remember me any more. It's nice to see the old stick.
Nera
	Bianca's grown up to be such a beauty.
	Imagine his surprise if he saw her now!
Bianca
	I felt terrible when I heard about the soldiers from Coburg burnin' this place to the ground.
Bianca
	It must've bin even more of a shock for you, %a000090. Finally comin' home and findin'
	it like this...
Bianca
	Come on, let's get goin'. You just need to get this in the bag and then the happy ever after's all yours.
Bianca
	Seein' the town like this is so sad. It's like those soldiers from Coburg wiped out all the nice memories here when they did what they did.
Bianca
	The ones who set fire to your old place are the ones I despise the most.
Bianca
	They would've destroyed that book I tried to read to you all them years ago.
Nera
	I'd heard talk of Whealbrook before. To think that this is where you used to live!
Nera
	Most of the people have left, so there's not much hope for the place being rebuilt.
Bianca
	It's hard to imagine Pankraz bein' stumped
	by anythin'.
Nera
	Your father must have been absolutely desperate to rescue your mother, the poor man.
Bianca
	We'll find your mum, %a000090. If it's the last thing we do!
Nera
	I'd so love to meet your mother. I'm sure she's a wonderful person, just like you.
%0%a001230
	Blossom in a place like this! What a surprise!
Bianca
	This place looks all the more sorry for itself
	of a night.
Nera
	I can't believe this is where you used to live.
	What a terrible state it's in.
Bianca
	Eh? Honey's the name of a faerie?
Bianca
	You're so lucky, goin' off on an adventure with a faerie like that! I wish I could've gone.
Nera
	Does the name Honey mean something to you? Ooh! She's a faerie, is she?
Nera
	I used to play with faeries all the time when I was little. I suppose that makes me sound a bit of a loner.
Bianca
	You were about that age, eh, %a000090?
	When Pankraz died, I mean.
Nera
	There seem to be so many orphans around nowadays. What is the world coming to?
Bianca
	We could stay here too, eh? It's nice to see there are still people you can count on, even after all that's happened.
Nera
	Shall we stay here for the night? The people running the inn seem like decent folk.
Bianca
	You helped a bloke who got stuck here lookin' for medicinal herbs once, right, %a000090?
Bianca
	I know all about it, see. He was well impressed
	with you, a brave little kid goin' into a cave with
	so many monsters.
Bianca
	The first time I came in here was just after
	them soldiers from Coburg burnt Whealbrook
	to the ground.
Bianca
	I thought maybe I'd find you in here hidin', you see.
Nera
	You must've been a born adventurer to come playing in this cave when you were such a small boy!
Nera
	You used to play here when you were little, just like I used to play at the lookout tower.
Nera
	I used to be scolded terribly by Papa if he ever caught me there.
Bianca
	Blimey! You get let on through without one word of questionin'! You must be more important than you look!
Nera
	It must be terribly boring for that soldier having to stand guard here all the time.
Bianca
	We're underneath the river now, eh? What would happen if the tunnel collapsed...?
Nera
	If you listen hard, you can hear the river running up above. It's very relaxing.
Bianca
	What a funny old man! Dun't he realise it was you and Harry who made everythin' peaceful again?
Nera
	Maybe I should look at the river flowing by and make some kind of wish too.
Bianca
	So this is where your father was killed...
Bianca
	How evil, takin' the life of someone so pure and good! I'll never forgive 'em.
Bianca
	Pankraz... The two of us are married now.
	Please watch over us and keep us safe.
Nera
	So this is the place where Pankraz gave his life for you... Maybe I should say a prayer.
Nera
	Dear Pankraz. I am Nera and, together with %a000090, I will be sure to save your beloved wife.
Nera
	So please lay down your head and rest easy now in the arms of the Goddess. Amen.
Nera
	When this journey is finally over, we must be sure to build a memorial to your father.
Bianca
	Maybe Pankraz would still be alive if only Harry hadn't bin kidnapped.
Bianca
	I s'pose no good can come of thinkin' like that, though. Harry was only young, after all. It wasn't his fault.
Bianca
	So this is the last place you and your father travelled to together. The end of your adventures...
Nera
	You seem to be really down in the dumps ever since we arrived here. Why don't we move on?
Bianca
	We got a boat from here when we moved to Stockenbarrel. I was really sad to leave at the time.
Bianca
	You sailed back into this harbour once, at the end of one of your long trips with Pankraz.
Bianca
	If I'd known you were due back, I would've come and met you.
Nera
	This harbour... Do you remember too?
Nera
	Yes, it's the place we met for the very first time.
Nera
	It was just a fleeting encounter, and yet here we are now, man and wife. Isn't that odd?
Nera
	It was back in the days when I didn't think of Papa as Papa. He was just Mr Briscoletti to me then. That's when you and I first met.
Nera
	There are always so many seagulls here.
	I remember that from last time.
Bianca
	Peaceful times? Would you call these peaceful times? I'm not too sure.
Nera
	I just hope the peace lasts, that's all.
Bianca
	This abbey really feels like a sacred domain for women. I'm a woman meself, and yet I feel a bit
	like I'm intrudin'!
Nera
	I stayed here for a while and dedicated my daily life to the Goddess. Did you know that?
Bianca
	You know that nun, eh, %a000090?
Nera
	Lots of people come to the abbey in times of sadness and need. I just came here to study.
Bianca
	I s'pose that makes the prince on a white horse Harry! Ha ha! What a story!
Nera
	You're my prince on a white horse, %a000090. Aaah...
Bianca
	Yeah, I can see that. Harry dun't act much like
	a prince.
Nera
	Yes, Harry doesn't act like royalty at all. He's very down-to-earth. Oh? He wasn't always that way?
Bianca
	Talkin' of marriage, it won't be long for you now, %a000090. Nera's waitin'...
Bianca
	Is she blind or what!? I'm your wife and I'm stood right next to you!
Nera
	I seemed to rather fade into the background then.
Nera
	I'll have to try to make it look more obvious that we're man and wife in the future.
Bianca
	I'm sure you'll turn out to be a good husband, %a000090.
Bianca
	We've only just got married, so it's hard to tell what kind of a husband you're goin' to be. It'll be fun findin' out, though!
Nera
	She's had a really hard time of it, that woman.
	I heard all about it when I was here at the
	abbey before.
Nera
	The poor thing. Just thinking of what she's been through makes me feel all choked up.
Bianca
	So this is the abbey Nera stayed at once. I wonder what it was she was studying here exactly.
Nera
	Oh no! She's not back yet. I do hope she's alright.
Bianca
	It's quiet as the grave here of a night. It's almost like there's no one here at all.
Nera
	I really treasure the time I spent here.
Nera
	When I left for home, I never imagined I'd have the chance to visit the place again.
Bianca
	Yeah, I can see that. Harry dun't act much like
	a prince.
Nera
	Yes, Harry doesn't act like royalty at all. He's very down-to-earth. Oh? He wasn't always that way?
Bianca
	Talkin' of marriage, it won't be long for you now, %a000090. Nera's waitin'...
Bianca
	Is she blind or what!? I'm your wife and I'm stood right next to you!
Nera
	I seemed to rather fade into the background then.
Nera
	I'll have to try to make it look more obvious that we're man and wife in the future.
Bianca
	It's funny hearin' someone talk in their sleep.
	I wonder if that nun she was on about is okay.
Nera
	Oh no! She's not back yet. I do hope she's alright.
Bianca
	It must be hard on the poor woman hearin' that.
Nera
	I heard that the girl's father would raise his hand to her on occasion. And yet she still loves him!
Bianca
	This place is famous for its casino, en't it?
	Even I know that much.
Bianca
	Surely you en't decided to take a detour here so you can have a flutter in the casino!?
Bianca
	You wally! You've got important things to be doin'.
	We should get movin'.
Bianca
	We should finish up here fast and get on our way.
Bianca
	There didn't used to be a bridge in the past, so you couldn't get here from Roundbeck and Whealbrook.
Nera
	I came here lots of times for shopping in the past. When I was staying at the abbey, I mean.
Nera
	Naturally, I didn't go to the casino during my
	days at the abbey. But Papa took me there lots
	of times before.
Bianca
	I'd love to win a few readies while we're here!
Bianca
	I mean, it's the responsible thing to do. It's expensive providin' for our ever-expandin' party.
Nera
	The casino's just a place to have fun. They make sure you don't get too carried away by stopping you from changing tokens back into gold coins.
Bianca
	Coburg's the place where you went to the rescue, eh? I wish I could've bin there to help out.
Nera
	No one seems to know who actually brought peace back to Coburg. He didn't even realise the man in question was standing right beside him!
Bianca
	Back in the old days, I used to want to be a really good innkeeper. Just like Mum was.
Nera
	My dream when I was young was to grow up
	and become someone's bride. So my dream's
	come true already!
Bianca
	That soldier's wife must really love him to worry about him like that. Lucky thing!
Nera
	I'm sure I'd be saying just the same thing if I had to stay at home all the time worrying about you.
Bianca
	Ha ha ha! That little boy called you ⓗmisterⓘ.
	You must be gettin' old!
Nera
	Don't worry, darling. If you're ⓗmisterⓘ, then I suppose I must be ⓗmissusⓘ!
Bianca
	I dun't see any ⓗmisterⓘ anywhere. Unless he means you. Yikes! Does that make me ⓗmissusⓘ!?
Nera
	I used to play with those children a lot when I came here for my shopping.
Nera
	They used to call me ⓗbig sisⓘ back then. It looks like I must've aged.
Bianca
	A slime curio... Sounds pretty curious to me.
Nera
	Papa wanted one of those. But he left Fortuna before he could be considered a regular customer.
Bianca
	If the local folk are callin' the place strange, then it must be pretty odd.
Nera
	I don't think the place is strange. I always thought the owner was rather sweet.
Bianca
	Huh. Here's hopin' we're not goin' to get stung and forced to pay a fortune for this Zenithian stuff by some bloke out to make a killin'.
Nera
	I had no idea the Zenithian Shield was so valuable.
Nera
	I can't imagine anyone would want to spend a fortune on an item they can't even equip, though.
Bianca
	What an idiot! Fancy jackin' in his work like that just so he can go to the casino!
Nera
	Oh dear! Fancy leaving his shop like that.
	I hope there's nothing too valuable here.
Bianca
	Hmm. You have to be careful who you marry, eh? Marry in haste and repent at leisure, as they say.
Nera
	She should just tell him his behaviour's unacceptable. That's the only way to tackle a situation like that.
Bianca
	I s'pose that's because everyone's got work to
	do durin' the day. Unless they're all at the casino,
	of course!
Nera
	No doubt everyone's busy at work during the day, looking forward to the evening when they can come and relax here.
Bianca
	Yeah, I s'pose it en't really sunk in for me yet.
Bianca
	But I know this much. Wherever you are, that's where my home is.
Nera
	I'm sure that you understand, darling.
Bianca
	He must work nights to be sleepin' so soundly durin' the day like that.
Nera
	We mustn't wake him up. Let's leave him be.
Bianca
	I wonder what kind of adventures that old man had. We should ask him if we ever get the chance.
Nera
	Papa used to be an adventurer when he was younger too. Not that you'd know it to look
	at him now.
Bianca
	I'll bet she was talkin' about your mum, %a000090! That means she must still be alive!
Bianca
	All of the monsters back there in the cage seem to be pretty well-behaved, eh?
Nera
	The monsters here seem to behave just as the old man wants.
Bianca
	She looks a bit out of place down here. Maybe the old man likes havin' her here to keep him lively.
Nera
	Having a bunny girl down here gives the place a nice, flamboyant air.
Bianca
	Fancy havin' an underground jail in town! I s'pose there's bound to be crime when you collect so many folk together in one spot, though.
Nera
	Jails always seem to feel so cold.
Bianca
	Hey! Maybe he's the one who kidnapped Harry!
Bianca
	If only he hadn't done it, then maybe Pankraz would still be alive today.
Nera
	What a terrible man, kidnapping someone out of greed like that! He should pay for what he did!
Bianca
	Looks like you're intent on a bit of a flutter at the casino, eh? I'll tell Nera about you!
Bianca
	It's hard to know where to start when there's so many different games to choose from, eh?
Nera
	Don't forget that a casino is just a place to let off a little steam. You mustn't get too carried away.
Bianca
	It's a shame you dun't get rich when you win at the casino, but I s'pose that's just the way of it.
Nera
	Some people get hooked despite that. Imagine what it would be like if you could actually win money here!
Nera
	That man's eyes were all bloodshot and creepy.
Bianca
	Fancy blowin' all your takin's here, eh?
Nera
	Oh dear. He should really be a little more restrained in how he plays.
Bianca
	Yeah, it's not a bad show. I wouldn't mind wearin'
	a dress like that and tryin' my hand at a bit of the old theatricals.
Nera
	Yes, it really is a beautiful performance.
	I can't understand why there aren't more
	people in the audience.
Bianca
	I guess you have to roll with it when your luck's good, eh?
Nera
	You have to be careful, though. If you get too carried away, you could easily fall on bad luck.
Bianca
	When things en't goin' well for me, I tend to give up on them. Not just in the casino neither.
Nera
	I'm not sure that's a good idea. If you just keep on trying even when you're losing, you could end up in
	a very sorry state.
Bianca
	You never know when your time might be up, so I dun't want to leave anythin' in my life undone.
Nera
	Everyone seems to be talking about how the world's being overtaken with darkness of late. Maybe the time's finally upon us.
Bianca
	Typical old bloke, eh? Thinks he knows all there is to know about life just because his has bin a long one!
Nera
	What a shame if that's the only way he can
	find enjoyment. I enjoy everything when I'm
	with you, %a000090.
Bianca
	If the legendary hero dun't show up sometime, we'll all be in trouble. Your mum's life depends on it, for one thing.
Nera
	Do you think the legendary hero will just suddenly pop up out of nowhere?
Nera
	Or do you think he'll be born as someone's child and then realise his destiny one day?
Bianca
	D'you think you're s'posed to just get up on stage like that and start warblin' away?
Nera
	It's impossible to hear what's being said with all that noise going on.
Bianca
	She looks so pretty. Maybe I should try wearin' a dress like that sometime.
Nera
	Women can always put on a performance that will captivate their audience.
Bianca
	Exactly! There's no better happiness than two people who love each other comin' together, eh?
Nera
	That could almost have been a song about us!
	...Don't you think?
Bianca
	Bein' told not to open it makes you want to open it
	all the more, eh? We could try and have a peek while she en't lookin'...
Nera
	It's almost like she's saying that to try and get us to open it! Maybe it's some kind of trap.
Bianca
	I doubt they can do much travellin' with how things are at the moment. I s'pose that means they're probably stuck here a while.
Nera
	Oh yes. I don't remember seeing them here when I visited with Papa and Debora years ago.
Bianca
	Huh! It's not like she's still changing. She's only got her make-up left to do.
Bianca
	I reckon she's just tryin' to get rid of us. Well, you don't need to tell me twice. Let's get goin'.
Nera
	We should leave her in peace. We wouldn't want her to think we're peeping toms.
Bianca
	The slimes here are so colourful and cute!
Nera
	I wonder how those slimes managed to turn themselves into such funny colours!
Bianca
	Ha ha ha! Looks like the old bloke's havin' fun!
Nera
	He's looking at those slimes with so much
	affection. It's almost as if he thinks of them
	as his grandchildren!
Bianca
	Slimes are so bouncy and cute-looking.
Bianca
	But when you touch them, they're so...slimy! Yuck!
Nera
	The slimes here have such bright, shining eyes.
Bianca
	It'd be fun if we could get a talkin' slime in
	our party, eh? Unless they'd be too much of
	a chatterbox.
Nera
	Slimes are so childish and silly. Er... I mean childlike and innocent.
Bianca
	We used to play T 'n' T together when we were kids. You always won, mind.
Nera
	I always marvel at who thought up the idea of such gigantic T 'n' T boards.
Bianca
	If only you could always roll what you wanted, eh? I s'pose that'd get a bit borin', though.
Nera
	Oh dear. He's taking it all rather seriously.
	You men can be so funny at times.
Bianca
	Huh! Let's give it another go, %a000090!
Nera
	I didn't expect anyone to be down there! I hope he couldn't see up my skirt...
Bianca
	What a mean little man! We'll just have to make sure we dun't fall down, eh?
Nera
	The poor man. It must be frustrating not to have ever succeeded.
Bianca
	This place is pretty lively of a night too, eh?
Bianca
	There's a casino here, en't there? But we've got more important things to be doin', I s'pose.
Nera
	I never visited here at night during my time at the abbey. It's quite a revelation.
Bianca
	This place never sleeps, eh?
Nera
	If only everyone here was having fun. I'm afraid they have their fair share of desolate souls here too, though.
Bianca
	Maybe we should have a bit of a flutter, eh?
Nera
	The last time I met him, he'd just lost a lot of tokens. It's good to see he's having better luck this time.
Bianca
	I'll bet she was talkin' about your mum, %a000090! That means she must still be alive!
Bianca
	An island down south? Dun't sound like a bad place to settle down if you can.
Nera
	I don't care where we end up living as long as I'm with you, darling.
Bianca
	He en't jokin', %a000090. A lady deserves a bath after a hard day's work.
Nera
	Do you think he always stands guard when his wife's having a bath? He must be really devoted to her.
Bianca
	She didn't scare you when she screamed, did she, %a000090?
Bianca
	Ha! I knew it! You always were a big old scaredy cat!
Bianca
	Pah! There's no need to lie to me, %a000090. I know you far too well for that.
Nera
	I don't think we really sneaked up on her. She just wasn't paying attention. Well, she didn't seem to mind too much, so never mind.
Bianca
	We used to go off adventurin' outside of town when we were kids, so we can't say much really.
Bianca
	I wouldn't want my own kids goin' off like that, mind.
Nera
	Everyone wants a world without horrible monsters, but it would be a shame if all the nice monsters had to disappear too.
Bianca
	I dun't much like hearin' other women chattin' you up. I s'pose that's a wife's prerogative, eh?
Nera
	It seems I'm not the only one who finds you so attractive, %a000090!
Bianca
	I en't too hot when it comes to the old cookin' neither.
Nera
	I thought it was quite nice. I mean, if someone goes to the effort of making something for you, that's all that really counts.
Bianca
	What a weird way of doin' business!
Nera
	How odd, refusing to sell something to a customer who wants it!
Bianca
	Mum and Dad gave me a brilliant childhood.
	They always took good care of me.
Bianca
	With Mum gone, the family got a bit smaller for
	a while. But now you've joined, so we're back up
	to three.
Bianca
	And when we have kids one day, I'll make sure I show them the kind of love my folks showed me.
Nera
	I've probably told you this before, but I've never once had a fight with Mama or Papa.
Nera
	They showed me so much love and affection that I couldn't possibly do anything to disrespect that.
Nera
	I hope we can build a family together where people can speak their minds, though.
Nera
	It's okay to argue a little, as long as we make up and make the effort to understand one another.
Bianca
	He must be a feisty old man to spend every night down the pub like that.
Nera
	I hope that old fellow isn't drinking to excess with all those pub visits.
Bianca
	It's a pretty normal-lookin' place for a
	fortune-teller's house.
Nera
	I heard talk of the fortune-teller here when I was at the abbey. Apparently, her readings can be a bit hit and miss.
Bianca
	That girl... She was asleep, right?
Nera
	How nice of her to take the trouble to tell us all that even though she was asleep!
Bianca
	Sounds a bit traumatic. I s'pose that's what he deserves if he's done lots of bad stuff that's comin' back to haunt him.
Nera
	I don't know what he did wrong exactly, but it would be good if he could try to make amends.
Bianca
	Nice! Let's go and check it out.
Nera
	I wonder what this Big Book of Beasts is all about. How exciting!
Bianca
	Yeah, five thousand gold coins seems like a bit of a fortune to spend on a funny old curtain.
Nera
	Oh! Aren't you going to buy it? But it's so sweet!
Nera
	Sorry. If you've made up your mind, then I won't try to change it.
Bianca
	Did you really want this funny old curtain, %a000090? It dun't much look like your kind
	of thing.
Nera
	Yippee! I'm so happy! This is just what I wanted!
	It's so pretty!
Bianca
	Huh. There just dun't seem to be enough money for all the stuff you need when you first get married.
Nera
	Oh well. I suppose we'll just have to come back again when we've saved up.
Bianca
	He certainly stocks some pretty curious items,
	eh? Seems to be doin' a fairly decent business
	out of it, mind.
Nera
	I can't wait to see what the next weird and wonderful item he has in stock will be!
Bianca
	Looks like you're intent on a bit of a flutter at the casino, eh? I'll tell Nera about you!
Bianca
	It's hard to know where to start when there's so many different games to choose from, eh?
Nera
	Don't forget that a casino is just a place to let off a little steam. You mustn't get too carried away.
Bianca
	It's a shame you dun't get rich when you win at the casino, but I s'pose that's just the way of it.
Nera
	Some people get hooked despite that. Imagine what it would be like if you could actually win money here!
Bianca
	We probably act like that when we get caught up in gamblin'. How embarrassin'!
Nera
	He seems to be a bit over-excited. Maybe he's never had a win before.
Bianca
	You can lose a lot of money fast in the hundred-token slots, so you really have to go careful.
Nera
	Papa only ever played on the hundred-token slot machines. It seems rather frivolous when I think of it now.
Bianca
	Mum always said that every profession needs its underlings. Without them, the whole thing falls apart.
Nera
	I hope he has his dream come true some day.
Bianca
	Typical old bloke, eh? Thinks he knows all there is to know about life just because his has bin a long one!
Nera
	What a shame if that's the only way he can
	find enjoyment. I enjoy everything when I'm
	with you, %a000090.
Bianca
	If the legendary hero dun't show up sometime, we'll all be in trouble. Your mum's life depends on it, for one thing.
Nera
	Do you think the legendary hero will just suddenly pop up out of nowhere?
Nera
	Or do you think he'll be born as someone's child and then realise his destiny one day?
Bianca
	They all dance so well. It's quite a show!
Nera
	I'm surprised their costumes don't fall down with all that dancing about!
Bianca
	I dun't think I know this song specifically, but it somehow sounds familiar.
Nera
	La la la Ⓠ
	Please, %a000090, ooh,
	I need you!
Bianca
	Looks like you think it's pretty classy, eh, %a000090? I can tell by that glazed look in your eyes!
Nera
	Darling, do you mind if we go elsewhere? I'm not too keen on being here on the stage.
Bianca
	I en't lettin' her get the better of me!
	Da-da-daa, Da-da-da-daaa... Ⓠ
Nera
	Stop it, %a000090! It's making me feel funny seeing you watch her tummy button wiggling around like that!
Bianca
	Yeah, well, it can't hurt to let go and have a bit of fun every once in a while, eh?
Nera
	He he he! You are rather good.
Bianca
	Up north? I wonder if he's talkin' about Uptaten Towers. That was a lonely old place.
Nera
	You've probably travelled around an awful lot more than he has.
Nera
	I'm not saying that means we don't need to be careful. I just don't think we should worry too
	much, that's all.
Bianca
	What have we come here for, %a000090? En't we got things to be doin' elsewhere?
Bianca
	This place is dull as ditchwater!
	Not like good old Stockenbarrel.
Nera
	Oh dear. What a terrible state the fields are in here. I wonder what happened.
Bianca
	I hate it when people are unfriendly to outsiders
	like that.
Nera
	It must be an important conference for them to have someone standing on guard like that.
Bianca
	Die of starvation!?
	Things are worse here than they look.
Nera
	It's hard enough work as it is trying to grow crops, without having to put up with them being ransacked like that.
Nera
	I used to grow vegetables when I was staying at the abbey, so I can understand just how soul-destroying it must be.
Bianca
	The hills? I doubt he'd be able to find any food
	up there.
Nera
	It sounds like he's on the brink of giving up. He's probably thinking of leaving so that the other villagers can have his food.
Bianca
	Sounds like the old woman's passin' up on her food to feed the little one.
Nera
	I'm sure Papa would send some food parcels if I asked him nicely. But I suppose that's not a
	long-term solution.
Nera
	No. The only way to solve their problems here is to see off that monster once and for all.
Bianca
	This is a sorry old place. I doubt there'd be many other folk who'd stay here.
Nera
	I suppose we can't possibly expect a meal here.
Bianca
	That woman's so thin and pale. I had no idea there were folk about havin' such a hard time of it.
Nera
	Even the young women here have the most
	incredible accents.
Bianca
	I wonder if that means the monster is even
	scarier-lookin' than the scarecrow.
Nera
	Fancy being famous for such scary-looking scarecrows! Still, I suppose you have to do what you can to protect your crops.
Bianca
	Surely we en't got time for this...have we?
Bianca
	I s'pose it's a done deal now, though. If you said you'd help 'em out, then I'd better just go along
	with it, eh?
Bianca
	We always seem to be goin' off and tacklin' some monster or other, eh?
Bianca
	Maybe one of these days we'll even take on the Grandmaster of the Underworld himself, eh? Ha ha! Just jokin'!
Nera
	I seem to remember seeing a cave to the
	west of here.
Bianca
	It en't attackin' people? Sounds just like one of them monsters you have trailin' about after you, eh?
Nera
	I used to think that monsters only like to eat humans, but some of them are vegetarians, you know.
Bianca
	Did you see that, %a000090? I can't help feelin' like I've seen that beast before.
Bianca
	This place gives me the willies, you know.
	It's just a little bit too quiet.
Nera
	Ooh! Do you think that was the monster? It looked like it was tearing up the fields.
Nera
	The abbey used to be quiet like this after lights out.
Bianca
	They're pretty cautious for country folk. People in Stockenbarrel never bother lockin' their doors.
Nera
	I suppose it's fair enough that their doors are
	locked at this sort of time. Farmers do get up
	early, after all.
Bianca
	Shall we stay here tonight? I reckon we'd get a pretty quiet night's sleep.
Nera
	It feels a bit desolate, but I suppose it can't hurt to stay over in a place like this every once in a while.
Bianca
	I feel like everyone's lookin' at us. I think they're a bit scared of us, you know.
Bianca
	I think they're all scared because we have %a001210 with us and he's the one who tore up their fields.
Bianca
	But he didn't mean to cause any harm, eh? Hopefully they'll come 'round and forgive him.
Nera
	I feel like the villagers are avoiding us.
Nera
	I suppose they're feeling a bit bitter because of %a001210 destroying their crops.
Nera
	Poor %a001210. When he lost you, he couldn't go back to the wild because he was too tame. He couldn't attack people.
