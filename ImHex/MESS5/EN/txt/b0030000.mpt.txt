*: 
	Grrrrrr...
*: 
	Who are you?
	Who disturbs my sleep?
*: 
	My name is Estark...
	That is all I can recall.
Estark
	I do not even remember if I am good or evil.
Estark
	Why are you here?
	Have you come to destroy me?
Estark
	Then I have no choice.
	I do not wish to be destroyed.
Estark
	Let us fight!
Estark
	Then leave me in peace.
Estark
	I must continue my sleep...
	Grrrrrr...
Estark
	Grrrrrr...
	How is this possible!?
Estark
	You defeated me!
	And in only %a000740 turns!
Estark
	It cannot be helped. I must open the doors to my secret place of enjoyment.
Estark
	And I suppose I must award you with this trophy in recognition of your achievement.
~ %0%a000180 acquires the Catas Trophy! ~
Estark
	But bear in mind that I will not be beaten again so easily next time! Grrrrrr...
Estark
	Grrrrrr...
	How is this possible!?
Estark
	You defeated me!
	And in only %a000740 turns!
Estark
	Very well. I will award you with this trophy in recognition of your achievement.

Estark
	But of all the foolish lies to tell, insisting my son is among your number!
Estark
	Hmm, I wonder if he really could be my son...
	I have no recollection whatsoever.
	Grrrrrr...
~ A monster appears from inside the treasure chest! ~
*: 
	Hey! You found me! I'm Starkers.
	I mean, that's my name.
Starkers
	I'm the son of the famous Estark, you know.
Starkers
	I could come along travelling with you if you like?
Starkers
	Yippee! This'll be fun! I'm going to become all big and strong like Daddy.
~ Starkers joins the party! ~
~ Starkers walks off sadly. ~
Starkers
	Ohhh!
~ Starkers walks off sadly. ~
Starkers
	Hey! You found me again! Maybe this time you'll let me join you on your travels?
Starkers
	Yippee! This'll be fun! I'm going to become all big and strong like Daddy.
~ Starkers joins the party! ~
~ Starkers hangs his head sadly. ~
Starkers
	Ohhh!
~ Starkers sprints off happily towards the wagon. ~
~ But the wagon's already full! ~
~ Which party member do you want to send off to Monty, the monster monitor? ~
~ Give up on recruiting Starkers? ~
~ Send %a000180 to Monty? ~

~ %0%a000180 heads off to the monstergarten and Starkers joins the party! ~
*: 
	Oh no, I've lost Prince Pankraz again.
*: 
	Surely he's not at Madalena's place already?
	Not at this time of the morning.
*: 
	His Majesty and Mr Sancho will be furious. His coronation's due to take place any day now.
*: 
	Welcome, %H0860%Xtraveller%Ytravellers%Z, to the holy village of Lofty Peak. What can we do for you?
*: 
	The Prince of Gotha comes practically every day now to visit Madalena.
*: 
	The man has an irreproachable quality about him. Many of our people have come to trust him.
*: 
	It seems Madalena encountered Prince
	Pankraz when she departed on an excursion
	to the Eastern Forest.
*: 
	Madalena is a most beautiful woman.
	It is little wonder that Prince Pankraz fell
	in love with her at first sight.
*: 
	That Pankraz fellow is no ordinary man.
*: 
	There must be something special about him for Madalena to have been moved by his advances.
*: 
	Above us stands the holy tower of devotion.
*: 
	Nothing must hinder Madalena in her prayer.
*: 
	Have you been asked to come here by Pankraz?
*: 
	We shall never permit him to take Madalena
	to Gotha.
*: 
	Hello. Where have you come from?
*: 
	Certainly I did not expect to see more travellers in such a remote place as this. I was surprised enough when Prince Pankraz came.
*: 
	Dear Goddess, watch over these brave wanderers, and guide them on a path free
	from dangers!
*: 
	Please forgive me, but we are unable to offer travellers lodgings here now.
*: 
	The Prince of Gotha has incurred the displeasure of the Elders, you see. I don't know what to...
*: 
	I tell you what, though. I do have some information that may help you. Let us call it an apology for the inconvenience.
*: 
	The guard who minds Madalena is fanatical about a game. I believe it is known as T 'n' T.
*: 
	The powers of the Loftinians wane year by year.
*: 
	That's why the Elders are determined not to lose Madalena. The power is still strong in her.
*: 
	It doesn't matter how much they're opposed to it, people fall in love.
*: 
	If Madalena and Pankraz make a good match, it's only natural that they should be together.
*: 
	I cannot condone it. No Loftinian woman should ever be involved with someone from the outside.
*: 
	I doubt our stance on this. I know Madalena is one of Lofty Peak's greatest treasures...
*: 
	...but to confine her to the prayer room...
	Not to allow her to walk freely outside, even...
	It does not feel right.
*: 
	A young man who's as just and true as
	Prince Pankraz is a rare find these days.
*: 
	His unfeigned passion has penetrated Madalena's lonely heart.
*: 
	No... No, no...
*: 
	This is hopeless. Trying to paint a portrait of Madalena without her here is impossible.
	There are just too many grey areas.
*: 
	But I'm too yellow to confront the guard at the prayer room and insist he lets me in.
*: 
	And perhaps selling my paints and brushes to that merchant when my finances went into the red was a little short-sighted of me!
Pankraz
	Hmm... I must be able to get this portrait of Mada done somehow.
Pankraz
	The craftsman outdid even his formidable
	reputation when he made this locket to
	commemorate my coronation.
Pankraz
	With Mada's picture inside, it'll make a perfect souvenir of our wedding when the day finally comes.
Pankraz
	Oh, hello! Are you a fellow traveller?
Pankraz
	I'd say you've travelled quite some distance by the look of you.
Pankraz
	Ah! Then you might be just who I'm looking
	for. Have you heard of faerie quills and eyevory tusk-tusk ink?
Pankraz
	A picture drawn with that quill in that ink would last for years and years without fading.
Pankraz
	If you happened to have these items and could spare them, I'd be eternally grateful.
Pankraz
	Normally, I'd only ask such a brazen favour of family or close friends, but I just don't know what else to do.
Pankraz
	You've done it! You've located a faerie quill and some eyevory tusk-tusk ink for me!
Pankraz
	Thank you. And excuse me if I don't waste any time taking them off your hands!
~ %0%a000090 gives the faerie quill and the ~
~ tusk-tusk tusk inkwell to Pankraz. ~
Pankraz
	Now I just need to think of a way to get past the prayer room guard.
Pankraz
	What? The guard's not there now?
Pankraz
	I... I don't know what to say. I'm stunned that you would do so much for someone you barely know.
Pankraz
	............
	Anyway, seeing as you've arranged everything,
	I daren't waste the opportunity.
Pankraz
	Come along, Remembrandt! It's time! We must go to Mada before the guard returns!
Remembrandt
	Yes, sire! It's a little out of the blue, but my easel is always ready.
Pankraz
	Now I just need to think of a way to get past the prayer room guard.
Pankraz
	What? The guard's not there now?
Pankraz
	I... I don't know what to say. I'm stunned that you would do so much for someone you barely know.
Pankraz
	............
	Anyway, seeing as you've arranged everything,
	I daren't waste the opportunity.
Pankraz
	Come along, Remembrandt! It's time! We must go to Mada before the guard returns!
Remembrandt
	Yes, sire! It's a little out of the blue, but my easel is always ready.
*: 
	Day by day, I feel the evil of Nadiria breeding. Fuelling its own expansion.
*: 
	Our work is not yet done. We Loftinians still have our role to play.
*: 
	We have no grievance with the future
	King of Gotha.
*: 
	It is merely that if he were to take Madalena
	as his queen, she would surely not return to
	Lofty Peak again.
*: 
	Madalena's power threatens the monsters of the underworld. For that very reason, she is in danger from them.
*: 
	It is our duty to protect her.
	To see that no harm comes to her.
*: 
	For those of us chosen by the Goddess, our destiny does not allow us to enjoy the pleasures
	of ordinary beings.
*: 
	Madalena knows this as well as any of us.
*: 
	This is Madalena's prayer room.
*: 
	Without the consent of the Elders, strangers are not permitted inside.
*: 
	Th-That's a T 'n' T ticket!
	Is it really real, or am I dreaming?
~ %0%a000090 slips the ticket into the guard's hand. ~
*: 
	Ahem! I, er... Yes! Of course! I have some important, er...information to discuss with the Elders.
*: 
	I'll, er...be back later.
	Farewell!
Mada
	How unusual. The guard never allows strangers
	to pass.
Mada
	Perhaps he was lost in the great depths of
	your eyes?
Mada
	Where have you come from, friend?
	I sense something so strange in you...
*: 
	(slurp)
	I love Madalena! She makes me go all gooey!
Remembrandt
	No! Don't disturb me now! You'll interrupt the flow.
	Doing a portrait for blue blood that's the size of the nail on your little pinkie is no easy task!
Pankraz
	Oh, it's you again. Thanks to your help, I'm going to have a picture of Mada for the locket.
Pankraz
	But I'm afraid it's going to take a while.
	Would you mind coming back later?
Pankraz
	Don't worry. I promise to return the quill and the ink as soon as the job is done.
Mada
	I'm so embarrassed.
	But Pankraz insisted, so...
Mada
	No one's ever been so close to me before.
Mada
	Most people are afraid of my power. The power bestowed upon me by the Goddess.
*: 
	(slurp)
	I love Madalena! She makes me go all gooey!
Remembrandt
	Ah, you've come for your quill and ink?
Remembrandt
	Here you are. They're really blue ribbon materials. Thank you very much.
~ %0%a000090 puts the faerie quill and the tusk-tusk tusk inkwell carefully back into the bag. ~
Remembrandt
	Oh yes, Prince Pankraz left a message for you...
~ ⓗThank you again for helping me. I shall repay you in full the next time we meet. I stake my life on it.ⓘ ~
Remembrandt
	He was tickled pink with the portrait.
	But he and Madalena have left now.
Remembrandt
	I should think they'll just be setting off over the deep blue waters of the Eastern Sea about now...
*: 
	Madalena told me something good!
*: 
	She said she was sure she'd slurp into you again. And she said to say thanks too.
