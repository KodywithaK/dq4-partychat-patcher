Bianca
	We're not far from Stockenbarrel here.
	I wonder how Dad's gettin' on.
Nera
	I remember this place. I stayed here one night with the sister on my way back home from the abbey.
%0%a001240
	Oh! I didn't expect there to be an inn here.
	You know everything, Dad!
%0%a001250
	My legs are tired. It's really hard work
	walking on sand.
Sancho
	You want to rest here for today, friend?
Tuppence
	What a remote little place. I don't expect I'll find any nice young ladies to entertain me here.
Bianca
	Timin' might be important, but it en't everythin'.
	You need lots of energy too.
Nera
	He he he! What a funny little ditty! Just what you need to put a smile on your face.
%0%a001240
	Is timing important for life? Grown-ups always talk about such difficult things.
Sancho
	Timing? Maybe ees why your Uncle Sancho, he no have a beautiful señora wife, no? Because hees timing, ees no so good.
Bianca
	%0%a001210 was a sabrecat and not just a regular cat, eh?
Bianca
	You dun't think the sabrecat that bloke was just on about could be...?
Nera
	Someone's pet!? Surely you're the only one brave enough to keep a monster as a pet, %a000090!
%0%a001250
	Do you think such a fearsome sabrecat
	really exists? I'd like to see it for myself,
	wouldn't you, Dad?
Bianca
	I wonder what kind of gossip it is.
	We should have a look!
Nera
	Gossip isn't usually a good thing. But... I wouldn't mind having a look to see what it's about.
%0%a001240
	Gossip? I want to see it!
%0%a001250
	Sancho told us it's not right to gossip about people.
%0%a001250
	But if it's written down already, then maybe that's not so bad...
Bianca
	It's probably all just much of a muchness, but it can't hurt to take it with.
Nera
	I looked all the way through, but I couldn't see anything in there about us. Shame, really.
%0%a001240
	We'll take it with us though, won't we?
	You never know, it could come in useful.
%0%a001250
	I think a nice storybook would be much more interesting than that thing.
Sancho
	I no read these gossips.
Sancho
	Even eef you try to tempt me like the prestidigitator weeth the paella.
Bianca
	I remember Dad sayin' somethin' along the same lines. Family's ever so important to him.
Nera
	Darling... Um, never mind. I was just thinking how happy I am, that's all.
%0%a001240
	It was fun travelling around with Sancho too, but being with you is much better.
%0%a001250
	Dad... Aah, it's so nice to be able to call you that after all those years.
Tuppence
	It's quite useful seeing how various inns are run.
	We run an inn back home, as you know.
Bianca
	En't those sons of hers the priest and the bloke from the inn?
Bianca
	I wonder when she had them! She dun't look old enough to have kids that big!
Nera
	Some people get to live together as a family all the time. I can't help feeling a little envious.
%0%a001240
	So they're brothers. It must be fun having a brother to play with.
%0%a001240
	Not that I don't like %a001250, of course!
	She's cool too.
Sancho
	The papá, always he wants the boy, and the madre, eshe wants the girl, sí? Ees always like thees.
Bianca
	Crikey! That took me by surprise! I remember the cat at our place bein' like that at first.
Nera
	Oh dear! That cat seems to be in rather a bad mood. I suppose we all have days like that.
%0%a001250
	That cat's injured. See where she's licking?
	I hope she gets better soon.
Debora
	This place is quiet as usual. I can't help feeling like I want to stay every night and liven the place up a bit with some singing and dancing!
Debora
	You'd better do some chopping or the like to build up your muscles a bit.
Debora
	Taming a husband is one thing, but taming a monster is quite another.
Debora
	You'd probably be able to do it, though, wouldn't you? I don't know how we're supposed to remind it of its old owner, mind you.
Debora
	Gossip is a stupid waste of time. The silly rumours about me back home just meant no one really knew the truth.
Debora
	Hey! Why is there nothing about me in here?
Debora
	When we have children, I want to just let them do as they please. I only need one servant, and that's you, %a000090.
Debora
	For goodness' sake, %a000090!
	You can tame monsters, but you can't pet a cat without getting into a fight!?
Debora
	That innkeeper could tell we were a happily married couple, even though he doesn't know us.
Debora
	It's great that you seem nice and happy being my slave. It means you'll stay devoted to me for evermore.
