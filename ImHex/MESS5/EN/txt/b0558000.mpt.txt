Bianca
	This is another big old tower, eh? What's the plan, anyway? I'm not sure that climbin' it is the best idea at the moment.
Nera
	What are we doing here? Oh! So this is where
	the Zenith Dragon's powers were supposedly
	sealed away?
%0%a001240
	I knew about this island existing before, but I had no idea there was this tower here.
%0%a001250
	Oh! I hate heights!
Sancho
	Just looking at all those estairs...
	I no feel eso good.
Tuppence
	Who'd have thought there'd be a tower hidden among all these big mountains? Seems a bit odd to me.
%0%a001240
	What a cool tower, having the entrance at the top!
%0%a001240
	Shame we have to go all the way down to the bottom to get out.
%0%a001250
	Um, are we still high up?
	Or is it safe to open my eyes now?
Sancho
	Thees place, ees estrange... You can
	feel the evil here as esoon as you enter. 
Sancho
	My Majesty. We must brace ourselves
	for trouble.
Tuppence
	I s-say, %a000090! The monsters in this tower are rather f-formidable!
%0%a001240
	Did... Did that woman back there just die?
%0%a001240
	Wow... If only we'd got here a bit sooner.
%0%a001250
	What did she mean about the dragon's eyes? Why would anyone care so much about that?
%0%a001250
	Dad... Will you hold my hand?
Sancho
	No! The monsters, they cannot get away weeth thees!
Sancho
	I never have the honour of knowing your name, señorita. But I promise you, we, we gonna avenge your death!
Tuppence
	We can't run away just because she told us to.
Tuppence
	Goddess rest her soul, though, the poor woman.
%0%a001240
	Hey! What's that? Let's go and have a
	closer look, Dad.
Sancho
	Careful. Esometheeng just moved.
%0%a001240
	So we're at the bottom level. It's just how it looks from outside: bigger than all the other floors.
%0%a001250
	Is that...a dragon's neck? Is there more of it
	further down?
%0%a001240
	What's wrong, Dad? You look like
	you've seen a ghost.
%0%a001240
	Did you know that monster guy back there
	or something?
%0%a001250
	Um, Dad. That monster then...
%0%a001250
	Um... Never mind.
Sancho
	Come, we must carry on. We estill have many theengs to do here een thees tower.
Tuppence
	That was a shock. That monster certainly put up quite a fight.
%0%a001240
	Turned Pankraz to ashes? So he's the one who killed Grandpa? I'll never forgive him!
%0%a001250
	This is the first time I've ever felt pure hatred for a monster. I'll fight with all my might next time.
Sancho
	Eet was heem? He killed señor Pankraz?
	No! The pain een my heart, ees too much!
Tuppence
	I thought we were for it more times than I can
	count. That was one battle that was a little too
	close for comfort.
%0%a001240
	It looks fairly straightforward from the outside, but this tower is as complicated as you like.
%0%a001240
	I don't think I've ever seen so many stairs!
	It's okay, though. I can handle it.
%0%a001240
	This must be the tower we heard about in Zenithia. The tower where the Zenith Dragon's powers were sealed away.
%0%a001250
	I don't like anywhere that I can
	see a long way down.
%0%a001250
	I know I have to just put up with situations like this if we're going to find Mum.
Sancho
	Ees my duty to protect you weeth my life,
	My Majesty.
Sancho
	But thees place, ees so dark. There ees no even one window.
Tuppence
	The monsters here are a bit too strong for my liking. Are you doing alright, %a000090?
Tuppence
	I'll watch your back, don't you worry.
	You just keep pushing on ahead!
%0%a001240
	It's a bit weird that it has a basement even though it's a tower.
%0%a001250
	It's dark, isn't it? ...I'm not scared, though.
	I've got my eyes closed, you see.
Sancho
	Esuddenly, the air, eet has changed. Ees no like before. We do not know what ees coming.
	We must be careful.
Tuppence
	Yikes! It's a poisonous swamp!
	Mind how you go, %a000090!
%0%a001240
	Brrr... Is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
%0%a001240
	This is quite big for an underground chamber.
	I wonder which way we need to go.
%0%a001250
	Um, don't go running off anywhere fast, will you? I've got my eyes closed, you see.
%0%a001250
	Brrr... I don't like the feel of this place.
Sancho
	These theengs, they are esent to try us by the Goddess. We must take care, and move eslowly.
Sancho
	Esince just now, I have the estrangest feeling.
Sancho
	As eef ees destiny that I have come here thees day.
Tuppence
	It seems that the monsters are getting stronger the further down we go. Or is it just my imagination?
Tuppence
	I'll watch your back, don't you worry.
	You just keep pushing on ahead!
%0%a001240
	Why do you suppose those monsters were so interested in the dragon's eyes?
%0%a001240
	There seem to be a lot of mysteries about this tower.
%0%a001240
	Do you think we're getting any closer to finding Mum with all this travelling we're doing, Dad?
%0%a001240
	I wonder how the Zenith Dragon's powers were sealed away. Do you know, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Bad monsters are bad through and through, right? They never just turn good and start behaving themselves?
%0%a001250
	There's something bothering me about that dragon statue. There seemed to be something missing around its face.
Sancho
	I, I no expect thees... I never imagined I would find señor Pankraz's keeller here. I, I am overcome by my feelings...
Sancho
	But now he has escaped, we must finish what we came here to do.
Tuppence
	Erm, so what do we do now again?
%0%a001240
	I didn't expect the dragon's face to have a device like that hidden in it!
%0%a001240
	Whoever came up with the idea of going along on its tongue must have been an eccentric one. Just like Dr Agon, in fact!
%0%a001250
	It's fun walking along a dragon's tongue. And it's not even scary, even if it is high up.
Sancho
	Thees contraption, ees loco, no!?
Sancho
	I have forgotten the estress of the battle we just fought already.
Tuppence
	What do you suppose is waiting for us in
	here? There seem to be ferocious monsters
	all over the place.
%0%a001240
	Looking through that hole is really scary! I bet %a001250 would cry if she had a look!
%0%a001250
	Aren't we done here yet? Ohhh!
Sancho
	The ladders and the ropes, they are dangerous, amigo. Eef your mind wanders and you are theenking about paella, you weell fall!
%0%a001240
	So this is a dragon orb.
%0%a001240
	I bet the monsters we saw before would love to get their claws on it.
%0%a001240
	I wonder if the powers of the Zenith Dragon really are inside this orb. It's all a bit weird, really.
%0%a001250
	What a pretty orb. It's glowing even more brightly than the gold orb.
Sancho
	At last, we have completed thees task.
	Eet was no cinch, no?
Tuppence
	Um, don't have me carry anything too important,
	will you? I'd never forgive myself if I dropped it and it broke!
%0%a001240
	I would never have believed there was such a big room inside a statue like this!
%0%a001250
	This dragon is so big and majestic.
%0%a001240
	Wow! What an amazing-looking staff!
Sancho
	Thees estaff, ees perfect for you, My Majesty. Eet esuits you so well.
%0%a001240
	Look how high up the ceiling is! We did well climbing all the way down here!
%0%a001250
	This tower is just full of stairs and ladders and ropes. It's totally exhausting!
Sancho
	I, I cannot estop theenking about the monster...
	Eets face ees gonna haunt me forever.
Tuppence
	Brrr... Here's hoping we won't be running into any more monsters that strong.
Bianca
	Okay, I get it. You all explored this place. Very nice. Now can we move on?
Nera
	We don't have much time. Maybe you could show me around this place when everything's calmed down and got back to normal?
%0%a001240
	We don't need to do anything here any more, right, Dad? Let's go!
%0%a001250
	I've had enough, Dad. When we've finished what we're doing, I want to go straight home. I'm not very good with towers.
Sancho
	We have no more to do een thees tower.
	We must move on.
Debora
	I find anything that takes too much effort really rather tedious. There's no point in climbing this tower just for the fun of it.
Debora
	There's nothing left for us to do here, right?
	So let's hurry up and move on.
