	Do you think he's just going to give up? I'd never give up having got this far!
%0%a001250
	It didn't look like that man had a flying carpet.
	I wonder how he managed to get here.
Tuppence
	That treasure's ours!
	Er, I mean, yours, %a000090.
%0%a001240
	Oh! So Zenithia's at the bottom of a lake now?
	So much for it being a castle in the sky!
Sancho
	Thees man, he ees Zenithian, no?
Sancho
	You remember the Zenithian señora een Gotha?
	Eshe, eshe be eso happy that we esee thees man here! Ees wonderful news for her!
%0%a001250
	I'm quite good at using staffs. Let me try it out, Dad!
Tuppence
	The stairs leading up cut off just there. I wonder if there really used to be a castle at the top of them.
%0%a001240
	Hey! Where did that old man go? Do you think he went home to the sky?
%0%a001250
	Was that old man a ghost? He wasn't at all scary.
Tuppence
	It would've been helpful if he could've told us which lake the castle is in before he disappeared like that.
Sancho
	Ees okay. Een thees world, there are no eso
	many lakes. We visit them all, and we find
	thees castle, sí?
%0%a001240
	What an amazing tower! It really does feel like it reaches up to the sky!
%0%a001250
	Make sure you guide me, won't you, Dad? I'm walking with my eyes shut, you see!
Sancho
	When you are climbing eso high up, ees important to eswallow sometimes.
	Otherwise your ears, they estart to hurt.
Tuppence
	Are you sure this tower is perfectly safe? It won't collapse while we're climbing, will it?
%0%a001240
	There are so many pillars here! I wonder how many there are exactly...
%0%a001250
	Um... This is basically the first floor, right?
	So why is it so high?
Sancho
	Uf! Tomorrow, we wake up esteeff like the estale tortilla, eh?
Tuppence
	I'm fine with high places after all my time working as a castle guard. So let's just keep on climbing!
%0%a001250
	Yikes! The floor's all cracked. You don't think it'll collapse, do you?
Tuppence
	I'd be completely lost by now if I were here
	on my own. Thank the Goddess you know the
	way, %a000090!
%0%a001240
	Don't worry about monsters jumping out on us.
	I can handle them!
%0%a001250
	It's in a bit of a state now, but it's quite a pretty tower. Or is that a silly thing to say?
Sancho
	Hahh...hahh...
	Ees...hahh...getting hard to...hahh...breathe, no?
	Hahh...hahh...
Tuppence
	I must say that I'm delighted you've been able to bring me to so many different places, %a000090.
%0%a001240
	It really helps to have people fighting alongside
	you, don't you think? That's why I feel like I can handle anything.
%0%a001250
	It's nice to be able to see up into the sky from here. But it's annoying not to be able to look down!
Sancho
	More estairs!? You know Sancho, he no like heights eso much... I estart to feel dizzy.
Tuppence
	Good heavens! What an incredible view. The only thing around us now is sky.
%0%a001240
	Hey! Are we at a dead end?
Sancho
	Ees no time for siesta, friend? Your Uncle Sancho, he no eso young these days, you know.
%0%a001250
	I'm a bit tired after all that climbing up and down.
Tuppence
	Hm? What is it we're doing here again?
%0%a001240
	Wow! We're so high up!
	Look, Dad! Look at that view!
%0%a001240
	I hope we get to show Mum this place sometime too.
Sancho
	When the ground...hahh...ees flat...hahh...I feel...hahh...eso young...hahh...
	Here, I am feeling old...
%0%a001240
	Ouch! My neck really hurts now after all that craning to look up at the top of the tower.
%0%a001250
	We're finished here now, right? Can we go, then?
	I'm not very good with heights.
Sancho
	Ees more easy for losing your feets on the way down. You must be careful.
Tuppence
	I imagine it would be rather nice to have a picnic at the top of the tower here. Delightful, in fact!
Bianca
	So this is the tower to Zenithia? It's a bit of a mess, but I s'pose it's pretty impressive considerin' its history and all that.
Nera
	So this tower used to connect to Zenithia? I wonder how many heroic people climbed it in the past.
Bianca
	En't you got that treasure already, %a000090?
Bianca
	Then you should've told him, the poor bloke!
	That was a bit mean of you.
Nera
	Oh dear! Fancy giving up after coming this far!
%0%a001240
	He was talking about the magma staff, right? Don't you think we should tell him we already found it?
Bianca
	I'll bet the legendary hero climbed this tower,
	you know.
Nera
	I'm not usually very good with heights, but I don't mind this place. It doesn't seem to bother me for
	some reason.
%0%a001240
	It'd be nice to fix this place up and have it looking all grand again.
%0%a001250
	I usually try my best not to say anything too babyish. But I'm going to say this anyway...
%0%a001250
	You won't stop liking me, will you, Dad?
Sancho
	Hahh...hahh...
	Ees...hahh...getting hard to...hahh...breathe, no?
	Hahh...hahh...
Sancho
	You know, weeth señor Pankraz, I am travelling all over the world. But the estrange places, estill there are eso many.
Tuppence
	Ooh, do be careful where you walk!
	It's rather treacherous underfoot.
Debora
	What a waste, giving up so easily after making it all this way!
Debora
	This place was probably quite spectacular in its day. It's in a terrible state now, though.
