Harry
	Phew! What a lively place! Just looking at everyone running around makes me dizzy.
Harry
	I know the state of Whealbrook's come as a bit of a shock to you. It has to me too, as it happens.
Harry
	But now we're here, we should make the most of it and have some fun, don't you think?
Maria
	What a vibrant town! Busy places can be so uplifting. But we mustn't let ourselves be distracted now.
Harry
	Absolutely! We must stay focused, %a000090.
	No slipping off to have fun!
Harry
	ⓗLand of hope and gloryⓘ? I don't really have any particular hopes at the moment, as far as I know.
Harry
	Oh, come on! Don't look like that. There's nothing too pressing we need to do right now. Loosen up!
Harry
	Well, what I'm hoping for right now is to restore Coburg to its former glory.
Harry
	He lost? At what? I wonder what kind of things go on in this town.
Harry
	I wouldn't mind having some fun at the
	casino myself.
Harry
	But no! We can't, can we? We have things to do.
	The casino's going to have to wait until next time.
Harry
	It's as big as a castle town.
	I bet it's pretty lively of a night.
Harry
	It's a fine thing for a person to have dreams
	and ambitions. Mind you, I don't need to tell
	you that, do I?
Harry
	Yes, I think I need a dream. Perhaps I'll come across something with all this travelling I'm doing now.
Maria
	That young girl was so full of spirit and energy.
	I think I might be a bit jealous.
Harry
	A shop selling unusual items that's only open at night?
Harry
	They must have some interesting things in stock. We should definitely pay it a visit this evening!
Harry
	What kind of things do you think they might have for sale?
Harry
	We'd better go and find out this evening, %a000090!
Harry
	Ha ha hah! Just look at the envy in his eyes!
Harry
	There's nothing better than having something no one else can have, is there?
Maria
	His wife must love him very much to be so worried about him going out at night.
Harry
	What!? ⓗMisterⓘ? I'm not a ⓗmisterⓘ yet, am I?
	I'm not that old, surely!
Maria
	He's just a little boy. In his eyes, you probably are. But you shouldn't let a little boy's ideas worry you.
Harry
	ⓗMisterⓘ...?
	ⓗMisterⓘ!?
	ⓗMisterⓘ?
Maria
	Oh, Harry. Don't let it upset you.
Harry
	ⓗNo passage without purchaseⓘ? It does look like a great short cut, though, doesn't it?
Harry
	Hmm... ⓗCuriosity Shopⓘ? It does sound a bit fishy, doesn't it? Do you think we're really going to want to know what it sells?
Harry
	What on earth could it be?
	ⓗThe only one of its kindⓘ...?
Maria
	I've heard a rumour about this. People say it's some kind of decoration, something really extraordinary.
Harry
	If the residents of Fortuna themselves think it's a weird shop, it must be really weird.
Harry
	Well, if there's a place as lively as this, there must be somewhere else that's the opposite extreme.
Harry
	I wonder what's happened to Coburg while I've been away. Mind you, I suppose it's nothing to do with me any more, is it?
Harry
	............
~ Harry bites his lip and hangs his head. ~
Maria
	Oh, Harry, don't feel bad.
Harry
	There are certainly some really useful spells to be learnt, aren't there?
Harry
	A castle town in the north-east? Well, it can't be Coburg. Coburg's a respectable place. There's certainly nothing scary about Coburg.
Harry
	I'm afraid she's right. They'd be very wise to stay away from Coburg at the moment.
Harry
	Right... I suppose we are old enough to drink now, aren't we?
Harry
	I'll tell you something, I don't mind not being able
	to go back to that Zugzwang shrine. Talk about a living hell!
Maria
	Family is a wonderful thing. You know, having people around you who'll always care for you.
	I, I wonder if I'll ever see Joshua again...
Harry
	Don't worry, Maria, I'm sure your brother's fine.
Harry
	What sort of lazy cowboy sleeps like that in the middle of the day?
Harry
	Ah, it's the owner of the Old Curiosity Shop!
	I thought he was a rich businessman running the place for a bit of fun, but now I'm not so sure...
Harry
	Time marches on? It certainly didn't feel like it during all those years of slavery.
Harry
	But it's rather strange, you know. When I look
	back on it now, it does almost seem like it was
	over in a flash.
Harry
	Well, anyone could have told you that, couldn't they? Fortune-teller or no fortune-teller.
Harry
	D-Do you really think it's possible to
	befriend monsters?
Harry
	It'd be absolutely incredible if it was.
	We need to try this out at once!
Harry
	A bunny girl? Do you think Monty makes her
	wear that? As a uniform, I mean. Uurgh...
	I shudder to think!
Harry
	It's hard to turn a blind eye when you see people confined in such tiny cells.
Harry
	I mean, it's a bit of a shame, isn't it?
Harry
	He used to kidnap people!? Y-You don't think he's
	one of the thugs who took me from the castle all those years ago, do you?
Harry
	Unbelievable! And to think I almost felt sorry for the people in these cells! He can stay in here for life as far as I'm concerned.
Harry
	Wow! So this is what a casino looks like!
	And look at that! There's even a stage where they put on acts.
Harry
	All the lights are so dazzling, they're making my eyes go funny.
Harry
	Do you get the feeling we stick out like a couple of sore thumbs here, %a000090?
Harry
	Yes, so do I. I mean, it's a far cry from a life of slavery, isn't it?
Harry
	No? I suppose you're right. We're not slaves any more. It's our right to enjoy the casino if we want to!
Harry
	Ready to have some fun?
Harry
	Exactly! Ex-slaves like us have got nothing to lose, have we? Let's go nuts!
Harry
	What? A lackey never disagrees with his
	master, understand?
Harry
	Don't get the wrong idea, Maria.
	I'm not the one who brought you here.
	It was %a000090.
Maria
	It looks like a lot of fun.
	Why don't we enjoy ourselves for a while?
	Just don't lose track of time!
Harry
	Leftover gold, he says? That sounds like a useful piece of advice from an old hand, if you ask me.
Harry
	Lose! Lose! Go on, lose!
Maria
	Oh, I hope he wins!
Harry
	Phew! That's a bit scary, isn't it?
	Better not let anything like that happen to us.
Harry
	It's the first time I've ever seen theatre performed. It's pretty good, isn't it?
Harry
	Did you hear that, %a000090?
	We've got to go for it, he said!
Harry
	Only, we're a bit tied up with more important things at the moment. We'd better push on.
Harry
	He could be right, but I can well imagine us running out of tokens before that happens!
Harry
	I suppose that's one way of looking at things, but I don't intend on being laid out in the family crypt until I've done everything I possibly can.
Harry
	It sounds like he enjoys watching people
	getting fired up over their bets. Not the most admirable of occupations.
Harry
	Legends are legends, if you ask me. I sincerely doubt there's any such person as the legendary hero.
Harry
	Then I'll put down a thousand G that says he doesn't! H-Hey! I was only joking! Don't look at me like that. You're scaring me.
Harry
	Wow! Being so close to the performers gives the whole show an electric feel.
Maria
	It's such a romantic play! Do... Do you think we're allowed up on the stage?
Harry
	These people are fantastic! Maybe this could be my dream: to become an actor!
Harry
	O Maria! ⓚⓛ How did it go again? ⓚⓛ Though you are blind, and cannot see, I will wear my heart to show how much I do love thee!
Maria
	Stop it, Harry! You're embarrassing me!
Harry
	I wouldn't dream of peeking, but I can't make any promises about %a000090 here, ladies!
	He's the one to watch out for!
Harry
	So those actors travel around, do they?
	I don't imagine that makes for an easy life in these troubled times.
Harry
	Ch-Changing!? I can't look! I'd never be able to forgive myself!
Harry
	Behave yourself now, %a000090!
	Remember that Maria's with us.
Harry
	The slurpodrome's a great idea. It's fantastic if you just want to forget everything and relax.
Harry
	It's true. Slimes don't think like us, that's why. In fact, they don't think at all. It's all just mush behind those big eyes of theirs, you know.
Maria
	This little slime's so cute.
	There's not a nasty bone in its body.
	I mean... Well, you know what I mean.
Maria
	It's a miracle! I don't think I've ever met a slime that could talk before.
Harry
	This town never ceases to amaze, does it? There's Treasures and Trapdoors here as well as a casino!
Harry
	We're in danger of forgetting what we're travelling for. And how long we've spent here.
Harry
	Wouldn't it be great if you could roll the exact number you wanted every time?
Harry
	Argh! I hate being laughed at! Come on, %a000090. We've got to have another bash.
Harry
	I wouldn't mind having as much time on my hands as he seems to have.
Harry
	Phew! What a lively place! Just looking at everyone running around makes me dizzy.
Harry
	I know the state of Whealbrook's come as a bit of a shock to you. It has to me too, as it happens.
Harry
	But now we're here, we should make the most of it and have some fun, don't you think?
Maria
	What a vibrant town! Busy places can be so uplifting. But we mustn't let ourselves be distracted now.
Harry
	Absolutely! We must stay focused, %a000090.
	No slipping off to have fun!
Harry
	This place is almost as bright at night as it is during the day! I love all this glitz!
Harry
	Did you hear that? He won big! Come on!
	There's more where that came from!
	It's our turn to hit the casino now!
Harry
	But no! We can't, can we? We have things to do.
	The casino's going to have to wait until next time.
Harry
	Do you think he's talking about the
	Order of Zugzwang?
Harry
	I'm afraid to say I think the fellow's going to
	be disappointed.
Maria
	My brother heard the rumours too. And believed them. That's why he joined the order.
	If only he hadn't, maybe he'd be...
Harry
	Don't worry, Maria, I'm sure your brother's fine.
Harry
	ⓗA woman who is very close to youⓘ...?
	Do you think she means your mother?
Harry
	I'm not a big fan of fortune-telling, to be honest.
	But I hope she's right, anyway.
Harry
	My stepmother really believed in fortune-telling.
	I tell you, it was a bit scary.
Harry
	So that's why I never listen to all that rubbish,
	you see.
Harry
	So if we did away with the smug brat, we'd acquire twenty mini medals, then?
Harry
	I'm only joking! But don't tell me the thought didn't cross your mind too.
Harry
	He seems like a bit of a bruiser, but he's just a softie at heart, worrying about his wife like that.
Harry
	He's right. There's nothing like a hot bath after a hard day's work.
Harry
	She scared the life out of me, screaming like that! I mean, er... It was um...very loud. I wasn't scared. Ha!
Maria
	............
Harry
	She's right to be worried, I think. There are more monsters about between towns these days, and they seem a lot stronger now too.
Maria
	It's awful. We shouldn't have to live in a world where children can't even play safely.
Harry
	What are you smiling about?
	She was talking to me, you know.
Harry
	He's not far wrong there, is he?
Harry
	But it's not us he should be feeling sorry for. What about all the poor slaves still being made to work at the shrine?
Maria
	I think all food's delicious, no matter what it is.
Maria
	You can taste the loving care of whoever grew the crops or reared the livestock, and of the chef who prepared it all too.
Harry
	It sounds like he really doesn't dare argue with his wife about it, doesn't it?
Harry
	I couldn't stand that. I just hope I don't end up like that if I get married one day.
Maria
	He should realise that his wife's just worried about him because she loves him.
Maria
	It's only natural to worry about the people you love.
Harry
	I'm sure it is. But I don't even remember what my mother looked like. She died when I was so young.
Harry
	And my father was so busy he didn't have any time for me. It didn't really feel much like a family to me.
Harry
	Maybe if I were to get married, I could change all that and build my own family.
Maria
	Yes, I don't know how I would have managed without my brother. And even though we're apart now, he's still always in my heart.
Harry
	The people here have a great time of it, don't they?
Harry
	So this is Mystic Mridula's house?
Harry
	I was expecting more dodgy-looking herbs and weird animals, to be honest.
Harry
	Isn't she amazing? She knows her little speech so well, she can say it in her sleep!
Harry
	Sounds like he's in trouble there!
Harry
	Are you off your rocker, %a000090?
	It's a wagon! Where else are we going to be able to pick one of them up? And when?
Harry
	Wow! I never even dreamed of being able to buy a wagon for that kind of money. It's unbelievable!
Harry
	This is awful! That's the most unbelievable price
	for a wagon I've ever heard, and we still can't afford it!
Harry
	Who's been wasting all our gold, hm?
	It, it wasn't me.
Harry
	That was dead lucky, wasn't it, buying a wagon so cheaply? A gift from the Goddess for everything we've had to suffer up to now.
Harry
	He must just be a rich businessman having a bit of fun selling odd items, don't you think?
Harry
	Wow! So this is what a casino looks like!
	And look at that! There's even a stage where they put on acts.
Harry
	All the lights are so dazzling, they're making my eyes go funny.
Harry
	Do you get the feeling we stick out like a couple of sore thumbs here, %a000090?
Harry
	Yes, so do I. I mean, it's a far cry from a life of slavery, isn't it?
Harry
	No? I suppose you're right. We're not slaves any more. It's our right to enjoy the casino if we want to!
Harry
	Ready to have some fun?
Harry
	Exactly! Ex-slaves like us have got nothing to lose, have we? Let's go nuts!
Harry
	What? A lackey never disagrees with his
	master, understand?
Harry
	Don't get the wrong idea, Maria.
	I'm not the one who brought you here.
	It was %a000090.
Maria
	It looks like a lot of fun.
	Why don't we enjoy ourselves for a while?
	Just don't lose track of time!
Harry
	Right then, what shall we do? The slots, the slurpodrome, the monster arena...
	Let's try everything!
Harry
	I know, I know. We're on a quest and all that.
	There's no time for having fun at the casino.
Harry
	Leftover gold, he says? That sounds like a useful piece of advice from an old hand, if you ask me.
Harry
	Lose, lose, lose!
Harry
	Oops! I'd better not look like I want him to
	lose, actually. Maria might see me and think
	I'm really nasty.
Maria
	I hope he wins. Then he'll be happy, and it's always nice when people are happy.
Harry
	Hmm... That's a valuable lesson to learn. You can win big on the hundred-token machine, but you can lose big too.
Harry
	It sounds like it isn't all glitz and glamour for actors, then. They have to work hard to realise their dreams too.
Harry
	It sounds like he enjoys watching people
	getting fired up over their bets. Not the most admirable of occupations.
Harry
	Legends are legends, if you ask me. I sincerely doubt there's any such person as the legendary hero.
Harry
	Then I'll put down a thousand G that says he doesn't! H-Hey! I was only joking! Don't look at me like that. You're scaring me.
Harry
	They put dancers on stage at night, look.
	They really go the whole hog here, don't they?
Maria
	I don't know what it is about that song, but I really like it. It's so catchy.
Harry
	Classy isn't the word! Just look at the way she moves! She's amazing!
Maria
	Harry!
Maria
	I... Oh no. I can't dance. Come on, %a000090.
	Let's get off the stage before I make a fool
	of myself!
Harry
	Dance if you feel like dancing, %a000090.
	I think I'll just sit it out if you don't mind.
Harry
	Ha ha ha hah! Not bad, %a000090.
	You're not bad!
Maria
	Actually, you know...this is really good fun!
Harry
	I had no idea there was a castle like that around here. The world's really not a safe place any more,
	is it?
Harry
	What a run-down-looking village!
Harry
	No! This is where you used to live!?
	But it's so different to how you said.
Harry
	Being in this place makes me feel more than a smidgen uneasy.
Harry
	It reminds me what a thoughtless fool I was back in my younger years.
Harry
	............
~ Harry seems to be deep in thought. ~
Maria
	Oh dear! This village is in a terrible way!
	...Oh! This is your village, %a000090?
Maria
	I see. So that's why Harry looks so down in the dumps.
Maria
	But there's no need for you to feel bad, Harry. You're not the one who did this.
Harry
	Oh, Maria...
Harry
	I'll look for it too! I'll do whatever I can to help you, %a000090!
Harry
	What pretty blossoms!
Harry
	So the soldiers of Coburg burnt this place to the ground?
Harry
	And people think it's your father's fault I went missing?
Harry
	I'm so sorry, %a000090. I had no idea that it would come to this.
Harry
	What in the world has happened to Coburg!?
	How could they ever do something so cruel!?
Harry
	............
~ Harry is hanging his head low and chewing his lip. ~
Harry
	So the soldiers of Coburg burnt this place to the ground?
Harry
	And people think it's your father's fault I went missing?
Harry
	I'm so sorry, %a000090. I had no idea that it would come to this.
Harry
	I have the image of your father burnt in my mind's eye.
Harry
	You absolutely have to find your mother, %a000090!
Harry
	The soldiers who came here were funny-looking? I wonder what he meant by that.
Harry
	I'm going to do something about Coburg, you mark my words!
Harry
	Everywhere seems comfortable after that awful place we had to sleep in back at the temple.
Harry
	............
~ Harry looks like he's feeling ashamed. ~
Harry
	What a run-down-looking village!
Harry
	No! This is where you used to live!?
	But it's so different to how you said.
Harry
	Oh! I'm terrible with stories like this! Huh!
	I feel all tearful now!
Harry
	You don't think it was the soldiers from Coburg, do you? That poor child's parents...
Maria
	Oh, Harry, don't feel bad.
~ Harry looks like he's struggling not to cry. ~
Harry
	It's strange that even someone as strong as your father couldn't equip that sword.
Harry
	I suppose this legendary hero must have some special quality that enables him to use it like no other can.
Maria
	My brother and I could sense that you and Harry had some kind of special destiny, %a000090.
Maria
	And now here I am travelling around with you both! It's quite a strange feeling.
Harry
	Bianca's that friend of yours you had when you were little, isn't she? I hope she's well.
Harry
	Even if the hero is dead, it's possible he might have had a grandchild. We should start by looking for this legendary equipment first.
Harry
	So you used to come here when you were young, did you, %a000090?
Harry
	I suppose it's not a bad sort of place to practise your adventuring, what with the monsters around here not being all that strong.
Harry
	I can't help feeling that it's my fault your village is in such a sorry state. Don't you agree?
Harry
	Well, if there's anything at all I can do to make amends, you must say so, %a000090.
Harry
	I know you're just saying that to make me feel better, but thank you.
Harry
	We don't really have any reason to be here, do we, %a000090? Perhaps we should try to focus a bit more on the task at hand.
Maria
	I'm afraid I'm not very good in caves. For some reason, I can't help being reminded of that awful temple.
Harry
	This is an interesting-looking sword. You should check that treasure chest while we're here too, %a000090.
Harry
	So this is the Zenithian Sword. It's incredible how shiny the blade is even though it's so ancient. It must have amazing powers.
Harry
	It's a shame that only the legendary hero can use the Zenithian Sword.
Harry
	You know, I did wonder for a while if you might be him, but it looks like I was wrong.
Harry
	A dark world called Nadiria, the Zenithian Sword, the legendary hero... It's all a bit far-fetched, don't you think?
Harry
	Still, now that we've read it, I suppose we've no choice but to search for the rest of the Zenithian Equipment and the hero to boot!
Harry
	We should at least take the Zenithian Sword with us, don't you think?
Harry
	It's funny how your father left that letter here, isn't it?
Harry
	Maybe he somehow knew that something bad was going to happen to him.
Harry
	And yet he still carried on with his travels regardless.
Harry
	We've found what we were looking for, anyway. We should head back to the village.
Maria
	Don't think I don't appreciate you showing me around all these different places and everything.
Maria
	It's just... I think we should prioritise trying to help all those poor people who are suffering.
Harry
	Absolutely! We must stay focused, %a000090.
	No slipping off to have fun!
Harry
	So this is where that childhood friend of yours is from. At least this place hasn't been burnt to the ground.
Harry
	I wonder how that friend of yours, Bianca, is getting along. Let's go and find her.
Harry
	............
~ Harry seems to be deep in thought. ~
Harry
	Now I've heard what I've heard, I don't really have any choice but to go back to the castle and find out what's going on.
Harry
	............
~ Harry is hanging his head low in silence. ~
Harry
	No matter where we go, we never hear a good word said about Coburg.
Harry
	Make sure you keep that Zenithian Sword hidden, won't you, %a000090? That probably counts as a legendary weapon.
Harry
	I hadn't realised the full extent of things up to now.
Harry
	But I'm starting to see that our world's in quite a perilous state.
Harry
	Oh, that's a shame, %a000090.
Harry
	I was looking forward to seeing your face when you met her again after all these years.
Harry
	I suppose it is quite romantic, the idea of searching for someone. It just doesn't feel that way when you're the one doing it.
Harry
	I wonder if all mothers feel like that.
Harry
	Don't know why I'm asking you, mind. Neither of us would have a clue when it comes to answering that question.
Harry
	So this is Bianca's house?
	It's not a bad-looking place.
Harry
	I wonder where she is.
Harry
	Oh. So Bianca's not here any more.
Harry
	Ha! So this is the famous Zizzwizz Pillow!
	It smells fantastic.
Harry
	Seven years ago? That's quite a while back now.
Harry
	Don't be too disappointed, %a000090!
	I'm sure you'll run into her again somewhere.
Harry
	Ha! So this is the famous Zizzwizz Pillow!
	It smells fantastic.
Harry
	That bunny girl's certainly, um...a bit old,
	isn't she?
Harry
	No! She looked the same all that time ago?
	...That's ten years!
Harry
	What are you playing at? We don't have time to mess around. We need to ask about the legendary hero.
Harry
	First there was all the talk about the legendary hero, and now we have this ⓗEsⓘ something or other to think about too.
Harry
	It's too much!
Maria
	Don't think I don't appreciate you showing me around all these different places and everything.
Maria
	It's just... I think we should prioritise trying to help all those poor people who are suffering.
Harry
	Absolutely! We must stay focused, %a000090.
	No slipping off to have fun!
Harry
	So this is where that childhood friend of yours is from. At least this place hasn't been burnt to the ground.
Harry
	I wonder how that friend of yours, Bianca, is getting along. Let's go and find her.
Harry
	Wilbur was always much cleverer than me.
	I thought he'd make a good king.
Harry
	If anyone has a way of communicating with monsters, I'd say it's you, %a000090.
Harry
	And Monty the monster monitor is another one who seems to get on with the things.
Harry
	Hey! Maybe the old man is part of the clan who guard the seal! ...Actually, no. He hardly looks the part.
Harry
	We don't have anyone who'd say that kind of thing about us.
Harry
	When I get married and have children of my own, I'm going to spoil them something rotten!
Harry
	We should stay here the night too.
Harry
	I have a few things I need to think about.
Harry
	Um, %a000090. Like I said last night, I'm quite concerned about the situation over in Coburg.
Harry
	I know it'll be a bit of a detour for us, but do you mind if we go and see what's going on?
Harry
	That bunny girl's certainly, um...a bit old,
	isn't she?
Harry
	No! She looked the same all that time ago?
	...That's ten years!
Harry
	What are you playing at? We don't have time to mess around. We need to ask about the legendary hero.
Harry
	First there was all the talk about the legendary hero, and now we have this ⓗEsⓘ something or other to think about too.
Harry
	It's too much!
Harry
	Just because you have a legendary weapon, it doesn't mean you can equip it. More's the pity.
Harry
	He's not the only one who's disappointed. I wonder where they are now and what they're doing.
Harry
	So this is the castle you came to all those years ago on your big ghost-hunt?
Harry
	You must've been quite a brave young thing, coming here in the middle of the night when you were just a child!
Maria
	I had no idea there was a castle all the way out here.
Harry
	(cough cough)
	It looks smart enough from the outside, but it's a real dust trap on the inside!
Harry
	Why have we come here, %a000090?
	I certainly can't think of any good reason.
Harry
	Unless! Are you taking us on a trip down memory lane with you, by any chance?
Harry
	Hey! Did you see that!? I wonder if it was a ghost. Let's go and see!
Harry
	There was I hoping I'd seen a ghost, when it was nothing more than a runaway couple!
	I didn't expect to find them here.
Maria
	Aaah, forbidden love across the class boundaries... At least they were lucky enough to find this place to live in together.
Harry
	It's good that the two of them didn't go through with the dying idea. Once you're dead, you're dead. There's no changing your mind then.
Maria
	They both seem so happy. Seeing people like that makes me feel happy too.
Harry
	What a strange count he must've been to have put his graveyard up on the castle roof!
Harry
	The people in these graves asked you to defeat the ghosts? That all sounds a bit far-fetched!
Harry
	That man doesn't seem to have much of a shadow.
	M-Maybe I'm just imagining it, though. Ha ha!
Harry
	The only way to reach any of the other continents from here is by boat.
Maria
	I feel so unsettled when I look at the ocean. On the other side of it is my brother and all those poor people trapped as slaves.
Harry
	Don't worry, Maria, I'm sure your brother's fine.
Harry
	............
~ Harry appears to be deep in thought. ~
Harry
	I find it hard to imagine Wilbur giving out
	such strict orders. He was never the most
	strong-minded of chaps.
Harry
	All of this will change when we oust that impostor.
Harry
	............
~ Harry is hanging his head low in silence. ~
Harry
	Permission!? I didn't need anything of the sort when I was a child!
Harry
	I know you want to go, %a000090. But I'm afraid Coburg holds no attraction for me whatsoever any more.
Harry
	That's Frank. He used to just be a lowly servant. And yet look at him now, a soldier and everything!
Harry
	His one weakness is large frogs. He's so scared of them! I used to have a lot of fun planting them about the place to give him a fright!
Harry
	That's Coburg just across the river. The wind smells just the same as it used to in the old days.
Harry
	Heavy-handed laws? I wonder what he means.
	We'll have to find out what's going on.
Harry
	I didn't imagine I'd be setting foot in this place again. And yet here I am!
Harry
	Things seem to have changed an awful lot. The place looks really run-down.
Maria
	To think that you were prince of such a grand-looking castle, Harry!
Maria
	Now I feel all ashamed. Have I been disrespectful, speaking to you in such a familiar way?
Harry
	Don't be ridiculous! It makes me feel sad hearing you say things like that.
Harry
	Surely we can't be in danger just for coming near the castle!? Whatever has become of this place?
Harry
	There were plenty of times when we went without food for three days back when we were slaves, eh, %a000090?
Maria
	I heard a few nasty rumours about Coburg back at the abbey, but I had no idea things were this bad.
Harry
	That was a bit mean, %a000090. Surely you could afford to give her a few coins?
Maria
	If I had any money, I'd give as much as I could to these poor folk here.
Harry
	............
~ Harry is biting his lip in thought. ~
Maria
	Goddess, please have mercy on these poor suffering souls.
Harry
	I cried with hunger in those first awful days of becoming a slave. There's nothing worse than being without food.
Maria
	That poor boy. He looks so weak and thin...
Harry
	A monster in the castle courtyard of all places! I thought it was a dog, and it took me totally off-guard!
Maria
	Are you alright?
Maria
	There's no need to worry about me. Luckily, you were there to protect me.
Harry
	Why are my people having to suffer just so soldiers from foreign lands can be enlisted?
Harry
	It doesn't make sense! Whoever's responsible for this will have me to answer to!
Maria
	It's just like in the Order of Zugzwang. Why is it always those that are weak who are made to suffer?
Harry
	We should still keep my true identity a secret, okay, %a000090?
Harry
	I didn't often use that passage, so I can't remember exactly where it is.
Harry
	I can't help feeling that it was always quite tricky to see in the daytime.
Harry
	A castle fell from the sky!? I didn't even know there was a castle up there in the first place. It's all a bit odd if you ask me.
Maria
	I've heard something like that before myself.
Maria
	Maybe the Goddess did it. Maybe she made the castle fall and the monsters attack humans again as a way of testing us.
Harry
	What's all this about the Queen Dowager? Shouldn't it be Wilbur who has the authority around here!?
Harry
	ⓗRules the worldⓘ!? Whatever does the old bag think she's up to?
Harry
	Ugh. This place has really gone to the dogs with people like him around.
Harry
	What's a monster like him doing inside the castle!? Am I seeing things!? Why doesn't anyone else seem surprised!?
Maria
	Dearie me. What scary-looking folk they are. I wonder how this castle ended up in such a state.
Harry
	He's right about those soldiers being an unsavoury-looking bunch.
Harry
	I was starting to worry that all the soldiers here had gone mad. It's nice to see one with his head still screwed on.
Harry
	It's been bad here for a long time, ever since the soldiers were sent to destroy Whealbrook.
Harry
	Curse it all!
Harry
	Darwin? I've never heard of him before. I wonder who asked him to come to the castle...and why.
Harry
	That all sounds rather complicated. I'm not very good when it comes to that kind of thing.
Maria
	A secret unlocking the mysteries of evolution? It all sounds a bit scary for my liking.
Maria
	I'd say it's more likely to be the hand of evil than the hand of the Goddess.
Harry
	I think it was around here somewhere.
Harry
	Ah! A switch! Nice work, %a000090!
Harry
	This passage was made so that it could be used as a means of escape in case of some kind of emergency.
Harry
	I never imagined I'd be using it to sneak inside my own castle! Of all the ironies!
Harry
	I only caught a quick glimpse, but there seemed to be a rather well-to-do lady in one of the cells. Surely not...
Harry
	Now I'm starting to remember. I think you can get to the jail cells from here.
Harry
	So she's the one behind all this? I didn't want to believe it because she is Wilbur's mother, after all. But now...
Harry
	The Goddess won't need to punish her, because I'm going to see to it that she pays for what she's done right now!
Harry
	Was that the real dowager, do you suppose, or the fake one? Now I'm really confused!
Maria
	What a terrible place to die...
Maria
	May all these poor souls find their way from these dark depths to the eternal comfort of the Goddess on high!
Harry
	I don't understand! That's definitely the Dowager...my stepmother. No question about it.
Harry
	So whatever is she doing stuck in a jail cell when she should be luxuriating away upstairs in the castle proper?
Harry
	So there are two dowagers!? Who is the other one? And is she planning on taking over my kingdom?
Harry
	At least this means Wilbur isn't the one at fault. That's something of a relief.
Harry
	Pah! I won't allow that fake dowager to send Coburg further into ruin!
Harry
	Just as we thought. That dowager must be fake. That would explain everything the old lady said.
Harry
	The problem is, how do we prove it?
Harry
	I'm going to do everything in my power to put this kingdom right, %a000090! Everything in my power!
Maria
	I can't believe a person could be executed just for not paying their taxes. Oh, Goddess have mercy!
Harry
	Hmph. That chancellor fellow is here. Not that we need to take any notice of that worthless creature, I suppose.
Harry
	A story about a mysterious mirror? Yes, I seem to remember something like that. But how does that help us?
Harry
	The castle vault... That's not far from the place I was snatched all those years ago. Brrr! The thought of it sends shivers down my spine!
Harry
	I've never heard anything so ridiculous. Can you imagine what it would be like if a selfish man like me were king?
Harry
	If anyone around here is cut out for the monarchy, I'd say it's you, %a000090. Don't let that go to your head though, eh.
Maria
	He's right, Harry. You really are brave.
Maria
	I'll never forget that day you stood up to the guard even though he had a whip in his hand. You were incredible.
Harry
	What a tiresome little man. I don't blame Wilbur for feeling so uninspired with a man like that as chancellor.
Harry
	Curses! I was hoping we'd be able to expose that fake dowager once and for all!
Harry
	But meeting with her alone isn't enough.
	We need some way of proving it.
Harry
	Curses! I was hoping we'd be able to expose that fake dowager once and for all!
Harry
	But meeting with her alone isn't enough.
	We need some way of proving it.
Harry
	This must be the book Wilbur was talking about.
Harry
	A mirror ⓗwith the power to show the truthⓘ... Interesting. We'd better go and have a look at that tower, then!
Harry
	It's funny to think of a teleportal inside the castle somewhere. I wonder who made it.
Harry
	Shouldn't we be heading over to that tower with the mysterious mirror, %a000090?
Maria
	Erm, it's not really my business, but what are we doing here? Weren't we supposed to be going to the tower?
Harry
	We'll have to come back during the daytime if we want to get inside the castle. We should rest for now.
Harry
	This place feels even more desolate at night.
	It's like walking through a graveyard.
Harry
	I'm going to sort this mess out, you mark my words!
Maria
	Shouldn't the rulers of a kingdom be there to make their people happy? That's what I always thought.
Harry
	I didn't realise that my father was trying to pass the crown on to me before he died.
Harry
	I do remember there being a strained atmosphere in the castle at the time. I suppose that was why.
Maria
	If only you'd become king, Harry. Then none of this would have happened.
Harry
	There are certainly plenty of books here, so it's quite possible he'll find what he's looking for.
Harry
	I wonder what the curiosity he's heard about might be. I never heard of anything like that.
