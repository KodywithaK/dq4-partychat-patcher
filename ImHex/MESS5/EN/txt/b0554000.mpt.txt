	What do you suppose this place is, Dad?
%0%a001250
	I don't like this place. It's scary.
Sancho
	Hmmm... I no esure, but... You theenk maybe ees estopping esometheeng from coming out?
Nera
	So you're curious too? I've been wondering about that jar for a while now myself.
%0%a001240
	This must be the place Mr Briscoletti was
	talking about.
%0%a001250
	The air here's really heavy.
	It's almost painful to walk in it.
Nera
	We must hurry, darling.
Bianca
	We'd better hurry, %a000090.
%0%a001240
	Um, Dad... Did you hear a voice then?
	Or did I just imagine it?
%0%a001250
	Be careful, Dad!
Tuppence
	What do you suppose the meaning of that strange jar is?
Nera
	The jar doesn't seem to have changed colour, but I can't help feeling uneasy. We should go and see Papa.
%0%a001240
	I feel all nervous for some reason.
%0%a001250
	We should hurry, Dad.
%0%a001240
	Yikes! Did you hear that voice!? We should get back to Mr Briscoletti's place fast, Dad!
%0%a001250
	Waah! Dad! It looks like something's trying to get out!
Sancho
	Galleons of garbanzos! The jar ees red.
	Ees very, very red. Red like the cape of the matador!
	We must hurry now!
Tuppence
	It's rather a sweet little jar.
	Much smaller than I was expecting.
%0%a001240
	It looks like it's still sealed up nicely. That's a relief.
%0%a001250
	We put things right this time, but do you think people will be in danger again in another hundred and fifty years' time?
Tuppence
	Ha ha ha! I don't imagine he'll be setting foot in the outside world again after the trouncing we gave him!
Bianca
	Ha ha! What a funny little monster! We couldn't very well take him along if he's tryin' to recover his old self, though.
%0%a001240
	Is that really Bjørn, that huge monster we fought!? But he's become so tiny!
%0%a001250
	Isn't Mr Briscoletti clever!? He must've been worried someone would just open the jar out of curiosity.
Nera
	We needn't worry. I'm sure the seal Papa put in place is a strong one.
Nera
	It's a shame for Bjørn, or Rebjørn as he calls himself now, but he's definitely not going to be
	able to return to his original size.
Sancho
	I no believe we make like amigos weeth a monster that ees eso monstrous like thees one.
	You are a very remarkable man, friend.
%0%a001240
	It's weird that he was just standing there in front of the jar all that time. Maybe he's not bad any more.
%0%a001250
	I'm not scared of monsters. Not if they're nice
	and small.
Bianca
	We can hardly take on every waif and stray we come across, can we? We've got our hands full enough as it is.
Nera
	It doesn't look like he's capable of doing any harm any more. I think we're safe to just leave him be.
Debora
	This is the place we came to check on that strange jar, isn't it?
Debora
	I have a nasty feeling about this. Hurry up and see what's going on, %a000090.
Debora
	The jar's still blue.
Debora
	It's been ten years now, though. We should go and report back to Papa.
Debora
	So the seal Papa put in place reduced him to that? Ha ha!
Debora
	I must admit, Papa is a lot sharper than he looks.
Debora
	The cheeky little thing! I've a good mind to force him back inside that jar.
