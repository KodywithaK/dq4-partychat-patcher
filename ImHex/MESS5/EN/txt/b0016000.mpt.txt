*: 
	Welcome back, sir!
*: 
	Good to have you back, sir!
Chancellor Jeeves
	Congratulations are in order I believe, sir. It is a task of some considerable peril to recover the
	Royal Insignia.
Chancellor Jeeves
	Your father, the late King Pankraz, would be extremely proud.
Chancellor Jeeves
	A most admirable achievement, sir.
Prince Albert
	I say, %a000090, well done!
	Jolly good show!
Prince Albert
	The Royal Insignia! You reeled it in, hook, line and sinker, eh?
Prince Albert
	Now we can get on with the business of un-kinging me, and kinging you.
Prince Albert
	I presume we've heard the last of your grumblings on the matter now, Jeeves?
Chancellor Jeeves
	Grumblings, sir? I was merely directing your attention to the traditional practices of the
	House of Gotha.
Prince Albert
	Well, yes... Alright, then. But anyway, %a000090's proved he's up to the task, so there's nothing stopping us now.
Chancellor Jeeves
	Precisely, sir. It would be customary at this point for me to inform your subjects of the ⓗchange of circumstancesⓘ.
Chancellor Jeeves
	And there's the matter of the ceremony, of course. Shall I begin making arrangements, sir?
Chancellor Jeeves
	Very good, sir. I shall set the necessary wheels
	in motion.
Chancellor Jeeves
	If you'll excuse me.
Prince Albert
	Hmm... Jeeves is a funny old bird. He seemed completely against the idea at first, but now he's

~ Better wait in the throne room with Prince Albert and the others. The baby's about to be born! ~
Prince Albert
	I see. Any minute now then, is it?
Prince Albert
	I wonder if it'll be a prince or a princess.

	Eh! Friend! I coming as esoon as I hear the news!
Sancho

Prince Albert
	Why don't you have a chat with the guards or something? Maybe that'll stop you fidgeting.

Bianca
	Thanks. That means a lot.
Bianca
	Look, %a000090. Look at our lovely babies.
Bianca
	So... What shall we do about namin' them?
Bianca
	I think you should decide.
Bianca
	What name do you want to go with for the boy?
Bianca
	And how about the girl?
Bianca
	%0%a001240 and %a001250. They're pretty funny names. I like 'em, though.
Bianca
	So the boy will be %a001240 and the girl will be %a001250. Are you happy with that?
Bianca
	%0%a001240 and %a001250 it is, then!
Bianca
	Here's hopin' the world'll be nice and peaceful by the time they're our age, eh?
Bianca
	I'm feelin' a bit sleepy now, actually. You dun't mind if I have a bit of a rest, do you?
Bianca
	Goodnight, %a000090. I en't never bin this happy, you know.
Bianca
	You want to go with somethin' else?
Bianca
	Oh, stop your teasin'! You're just embarrassed,
	I'll bet.
Nera
	Oh, %a000090...
	I'm exhausted.
Nera
	But I knew I could do it, because I have you.
	Am I a good wife, %a000090?
Nera
	That's all I ever wanted to be for you.
Nera
	Look at our children. Our beautiful children.
Nera
	We need to decide what to call them, don't we?
Nera
	You know what? I want you to name them, %a000090.
Nera
	So what shall we call our wonderful son?
Nera
	And what's our beautiful daughter going to
	be called?
Nera
	%0%a001240 and %a001250.
	They're unusual names. But I love them anyway, because you're the one who chose them.
Nera
	Are you sure you're happy with those names, then? %0%a001240 and %a001250?
Nera
	Then it's settled.
	%0%a001240 and %a001250.
Nera
	I hope the world is at peace by the time our two little angels grow up.
Nera
	I'm so tired, I can barely keep my eyes open.
Nera
	Good night, darling.
	I'm...so...happy...
	Zzz... Zzz...
Nera
	That's alright, I don't mind changing them.

	Good luck!
Bianca
	Um, %a000090...
	Dun't you find it funny?
Bianca
	I used to think Mum and Dad had always bin parents.
Bianca
	But people have a moment when they become parents, just like we have now.
Bianca
	I hope we end up bein' a really good mum and dad to them, eh?
Nera
	Good morning, my love. I don't think I've ever slept so well in my entire life!
Nera
	Today's the day of your coronation, isn't it?
	I hope it all goes smoothly.
Nera
	You know, %a000090, there's something I've been meaning to tell you about me.
Nera
	Mama and Papa... They aren't my real parents. They aren't Debora's, either.
Nera
	No, Mama and Papa took us in when we were still just babies and cared for us like we were their own.
Nera
	Apparently it was a famous fortune-teller who recommended to them that they send me to the abbey.
Nera
	They were told I had a special destiny, and that I needed to prepare my heart for everything that it would lead me to.
Nera
	I still don't really know what it all means.
Nera
	All I know is that my duty now is to you and my children, and to raising them as best I can.

	That's right. But Her Highness, Lady %a001230 sensed something was wrong straight away.
*: 
	I took the children and hid, but...
Soldier

Prince Albert

Sancho
	Eh, friend! You are theenking of going after your wife?

*: 
	And now your wife, Queen %a001230, too. And just after you were crowned king too.

	You are the son of King Pankraz.
	I am compelled to tell you.

*: 
	No, Your Majesty. We haven't seen anything suspicious here, sir.
*: 
	There is that strange, dark cloud to the north,
	of course...
*: 
	Mistress Gertrude doesn't listen to a word I say!
*: 
	I know she's no longer really a princess, but she should still behave like a lady.
Gertrude
	Why won't anyone believe me?
Gertrude
	I saw it! I really did! Chancellor Jeeves flew right over my head. He was going that way. North, you see. I'm not making it up.
Gertrude
	I knew there was something funny about that man.
*: 
	Ah! Your Majesty!
	How are you?
*: 
	I was ordered by your father, King Pankraz, to carry out research into a castle called Zenithia.
*: 
	So far, I've discovered that Zenithia's
	supposed to be up in the sky, but for
	some reason it isn't any more.
*: 
	I've also learnt that the Dragon God who lived there has gone missing.
*: 
	It's just a theory, but perhaps if the castle and its Dragon God were restored to their rightful places, the world would be restored to peace.
Thruppence
	Y-Your Majesty!
Thruppence
	I think I should explain about all the monster chess playing that's been going on.
Thruppence
	It was the Chancellor who provided us all with the pieces, you see.
Thruppence
	Apparently, they were sealed away in the
	castle vault.
Thruppence
	All us soldiers got completely hooked on it.
	It was so bad, we were neglecting our duties.
Thruppence
	It's because of our carelessness that Her Majesty the Queen was...well... Oh dear...
Thruppence
	Here. This is my monster chess set. You take it.
	I promise to be extra vigilant from now on!
~ %0%a000120 receives a monster chess set! ~

*: 
	Well? Did you find your wife, Your Majesty?
	No? Oh, dear. I'm sorry, pet.

	I wonder if that's enough milk for the little ones...
*: 
	Oh, hello, %a000090. Oops! I mean, Your Majesty! I'd never have guessed you were royalty... Oops! There I go again!
*: 
	There are dozens of soldiers out looking for Her Majesty, Queen %a001230.
*: 
	Have faith in us, Your Majesty.
	We won't let you down.
*: 
	Will you be setting off on a mission to rescue your wife like your father, King Pankraz, did?
*: 
	Oh, dear... How many more years does that mean we'll have to get on without a king, I wonder...
*: 
	Well that's a relief to hear! Gotha's been too long without its king as it is.
*: 
	Arf! Arf, arf!
*: 
	From what I hear, the Chancellor's nowhere
	to be seen.
*: 
	Just between you and me, Your Majesty, I think the guy's dodgy.
*: 
	Curse those monsters, kidnapping such a beautiful woman as %a001230!
*: 
	You can't let them get away with it,
	Your Majesty! It's time someone showed

*: 
	Well, thank the Goddess your children got away unscathed. That's something at least, isn't it?
Sister
	My heart goes out to you, Your Majesty.
Sister
	I've been trying to understand why the monsters would take Queen %a001230. But only the Goddess, in Her infinite wisdom, knows such things.
Sister
	When Queen Mada was taken, it was because of the mysterious power she harboured, but I'm at a loss to explain it this time.
*: 
	Ha-hah!
*: 
	Who would've thought it? King Pankraz's baby boy, back to rule Gotha!
*: 
	You have the makings of a grand king,
	Your Highness. A grand king indeed!
*: 
	Don't worry, Your Majesty.
*: 
	Queen %a001230 is alive, just like Queen Mada is. I'm sure of it.
*: 
	And when they're both rescued, a new path will present itself to you. A new way forward.

	I don't need you to tell me how great I am.
	I'm perfectly aware of that myself.
Debora
	But enough about me for now. Look!
	Look at our babies.
Debora
	Now then, we need to think of names for them.
Debora
	But I find all that thinking a bit overrated, really.
	So you're going to do it.
Debora
	What are we going to call the boy?
Debora
	And how about the girl?
Debora
	%0%a001240 and %a001250. Hmmm...
	I don't know why I bother asking you to do things sometimes. Oh, well. They'll do, I suppose.
Debora
	Are you sure you're happy with %a001240 and %a001250 as names, then?
Debora
	%0%a001240 and %a001250 it is then!
Debora
	I hope there'll be peace in the world by the time they grow up. Yes, world peace... That's what I hope for.
Debora
	Right, well... I'm pretty shattered now, so I'm going to get some sleep.
Debora
	There's no room for you in the bed now, %a000090. You'll have to sleep on the floor.
Debora
	Then hurry up and think of different ones!
Debora
	Very good.
	That was a test to see if you know your place or not. I don't need you to tell me how perfect I am!
Nera
	We are sisters, though, even though I know it's hard to believe.
Debora
	Oh, you're awake.
	I slept like a princess last night.
Debora
	So, today's the day of your coronation, isn't it?
Debora
	Just make sure you know what you have to do.
	I don't want you embarrassing me.
Debora
	Oh, yes. I suppose this would be a good time to tell you...
Debora
	Nera and I, we're not really Mama and Papa's children.
Debora
	We are sisters, though, if you can believe such a timid little mouse shares any common blood with me.
Debora
	We were adopted when we were small, you see.
Debora
	Apparently Papa thought it was his destiny to look after us or something when he saw us two little orphans.
Debora
	I don't know what destiny he was thinking about exactly, but anyway... At least I got to grow up with everything I needed around me.
Debora
	I mean, wherever I grew up, I would've turned out to be the exquisite lady you see before you now, but...
Debora
	Anyway, when you become King today, I'll become Queen. Now that's the kind of social climbing I like!
*: 
	Curse those monsters, kidnapping such a cracking woman as %a001230!
*: 
	You can't let them get away with it,
	Your Majesty! It's time someone showed
	them who's boss around here!
Debora
	I'll be needing a lot of ladies-in-waiting, you know. You'd better start looking into that.
*: 
	I found one of those eyevory tusk-tusks lying here dead not too long ago.
*: 
	It had such a peaceful look on its face. I suppose even monsters are embraced into the arms of the Goddess in their final moments.
*: 
	This church has been famous since long ago for its unique and mysterious ink.
*: 
	There's very little of it left now, so I've been called here to set about making more of it.
*: 
	It's such a complicated process, though.
	It's likely to be years and years before I
	have it finished.
*: 
	It was a while ago now, but I saw a group of monsters heading off towards the mountains in the north.
*: 
	I might be imagining it, but I could have sworn there was a human with them too.
*: 
	I don't know where you've come from, but I'd advise you to steer well clear of the mountains in the north.
*: 
	Apparently, there's a tower there full of terrifying monsters.
~ The party's wounds are healed. ~
~ %0%a000120's wounds are healed. ~
*: 
	Hmph. I dunno where that bruvver o' mine's got to.
*: 
	I'll end up comin' a cropper all on me lonesome at this rate.
*: 
	Tsk. You've done well to come this far.
*: 
	But you won't get any further with me in
	your way.
*: 
	There's snout you can do about it!
*: 
	No! How could oink be defeated like this!?
	㈢㈢Graaargh!
*: 
	Keh keh keh! Now there's a tasty-looking worm!
*: 
	That female creature who was here before looked nice and juicy too, but Kon claimed her before I had even one peck.
*: 
	I'll just have to make up for it by making a meal out of you. Keh keh keh!
*: 
	Keh! You have killed one bird with...I don't know how many stones!
*: 
	But Kon will make you pay for this, just you wait and see. Keh keh keh! ㈢㈢...Ugh!
*: 
	Awright? I'm waitin' for me bruvver to turn up.
*: 
	We 'eard rumours about some grand treasure bein' 'idden in the place, see. So we decided to
	come an' 'ave a gander.
*: 
	You awright there? There's a fair few traps 'ere in this tower, eh?
*: 
	You can't just go stumblin' about the place.
	I reckon you gotta make use o' some o' the devices and whatnot scattered about.
*: 
	I'm watching like a hawk because it seems %H0860%Xa suspicious character has%Ysome suspicious characters have%Z infiltrated our tower.
*: 
	What!? You're the one%H0860%X%Ys%Z!?
	You'll pay for this...!
~ There's a lever here. ~
~ Pull it? ~
*: 
	Grrrrarrrgh!
~ It turns out the rock was actually a rockbomb! ~
~ %0%a000120 looks at the wall. ~
~ ⓗConnecting Passageway, Switch Oneⓘ ~
~ There's a lever here. ~
~ Pull it? ~
Chancellor Jeeves
	I appear to have committed something of a blunder.
Chancellor Jeeves
	It would seem that going into cahoots with the monsters was perhaps not the wisest of decisions.
Chancellor Jeeves
	Oh dear. Gotha will be in a sorry state now.
Chancellor Jeeves
	I do hope you will be able to find it in yourself to forgive me, Your Majesty. ㈢㈢Uh-uuurgh!
Kon
	There is no necessity for galloping to your death.
Kon
	First I permission you for speaking some words of farewell at your beloved wife.
Kon
	There is no necessity for galloping to your death.

Bianca
	Crikey! What are you lot doin' here?
	It's too dangerous!
Bianca
	Just tell %a000090 this, will ya?
	...Tell him he should forget about me.
Bianca
	Crikey! You've really put yourself in danger comin' here, %a000090!
~ Bianca holds an Yggdrasil leaf to ~
~ %a000090's mouth. ~
~ %0%a000090 is resurrected! ~
Bianca
	%0%a000090...
	Thanks for comin' to rescue me.
Bianca
	%0%a000090! I knew you'd come.
Bianca
	But maybe it would've bin better if you hadn't.
Bianca
	The reason them monsters used the Chancellor to snatch me away was so they could lure you into a trap.
Bianca
	The ringleader says he's goin' to kill you and then become king in your place!
Bianca
	Agh!
Kon
	Enough horsing around!
Kon
	King of country must think foremost of his peoples, not of his own selfish wishings.
Kon
	And yet you come here!
Kon
	For this alone, you deserve to be put down.
	Whinny-he-he!
Kon
	Now! It is time for you both to saddle up for death!
Kon
	Whinny-he-he!
	I am indestructible!
Kon
	Nobody is able to hurt the great knight Kon!
Kon
	Die, %a000090! Die!
Bianca
	Stop!
~ Bianca joins the battle! ~
Bianca
	Stop right there, Kon!
~ A mysterious light surrounds Bianca's body. ~
Kon
	Wh-What is this light?
~ The light begins to break down Kon's barrier. ~
Bianca
	Go on, %a000090! Now!
Nera
	Oh dear! What are you doing here?
	It's terribly dangerous.
Nera
	Please just take this message to %a000090 for me and leave. Tell him... Tell him that he must forget about me.
Nera
	Oh! My poor %a000090! Look at the state you've got yourself into on my account!
Nera
	Nera holds an Yggdrasil leaf to %a000090's mouth.
~ %0%a000090 is resurrected! ~
Nera
	Oh, darling... Thank you so much for coming to
	rescue me.
Nera
	Oh, %a000090! I knew you'd come and rescue me!
Nera
	But... You really shouldn't have.
Nera
	The reason those monsters had the Chancellor kidnap me was so that you'd follow.
Nera
	It's the ringleader's plan to...to kill you and then become king in your place!
Nera
	Oh!
Kon
	Enough horsing around!
Kon
	King of country must think foremost of his peoples, not of his own selfish wishings.
Kon
	And yet you come here!
Kon
	For this alone, you deserve to be put down.

	Stop!

Nera
	Stop this at once, Kon!
~ A mysterious light surrounds Nera's body. ~
Kon
	Wh-What is this light?

Nera
	There you are, darling!
	Now's your chance!
Kon
	Th-This ㈢is not p-possible...
Kon
	The l-㈢light before...
Kon
	No! It cannot be! This woman! This woman, she has blood from legendary hero!
Kon
	Ladja! ㈢Ladja...!
	㈢Neigh!
Ladja
	Wa ha ha! So you are descendant of legendary hero.
%0%a001230
	............I............er............
	A descendant of the legendary hero...!?
Ladja
	It is foretelling of the great Nimzo that descendant of legendary hero will be of the high status.
Ladja
	Thus it has been policy that we snatch away all little children of importance.
Ladja
	But it appears the child is not yet born. He will be born in future, from your blood.
Ladja
	This was destiny. But this destiny I cannot permission for happening.
~ %0%a000090 and %a001230 are turned to stone! ~
Ladja
	Wa ha ha! It is no amusement simply for to kill you.
Ladja
	It is better fun to force that you slowly watch as world comes to its end! Wa ha ha! Wa ha ha ha haah!
~ It's impossible to move! ~
Heister
	This is a right wild goose chase, eh? So much for there bein' some decent treasure 'ere.
Huckster
	Hey! Look at them statues! They look ever so lifelike.
Huckster
	You know wot, bruv. I reckon we could sell these pair for a fair ol' price.
Heister
	I reckon you're right! Nice one, Huckster!
	The lady one's a bit of a looker an' all, eh?
Heister
	I'll be 'avin' this one!
Heister
	Come on! Get movin'!
Huckster
	Wait for me, bruv!
Prince Albert
	What? Don't tell me you still haven't managed to track down King %a000090, you useless oafs!
Soldier
	S-Sorry, Your Majesty. We have soldiers out scouring the kingdom as we speak, but...
Prince Albert
	Even my blasted chancellor's gone missing!
	This really is most inconvenient!
Prince Albert
	What's a fellow supposed to do, eh?
	I sure as billy-bally don'tⓚⓛ
Soldier
	Your Majesty! There's been a sighting of His Majesty, King %a000090 at Northminster, a church far to the north!
Prince Albert
	What? Someone's actually spotted %a000090 at last, you mean?
Soldier
	Yes, sir!
Prince Albert
	Right-ho! Well, send all the men north it is, then.
	Turn the place upside down if necessary.
Prince Albert
	Leave no stone unturned!
	Go, go, go!
Prince Albert
	I just hope %a000090 and %a001230 are alright...
Sancho
	What ees the matter?
	%0%a001240 and %a001250, they are okay?
*: 
	I really don't know. They've never cried like
	this before.
*: 
	I hope it doesn't mean something's happened to King %a000090 or Queen %a001230.
Prince Albert
	What rot! Keep such obscene gibberish to yourself!
Sancho
	Sí. There ees no need to worry.

Sancho
	There, there...
	Ees okay...
Debora
	What are you all doing here?
	%0%a000090's not with you too, is he?
Debora
	Then hurry back to him with this message: tell him to just forget about me and leave me here.
Debora
	%0%a000090...
	I know you pledged your devotion and loyalty to me, but this is going too far.
~ Debora holds an Yggdrasil leaf to %a000090's mouth. ~

Debora
	Why did you have to come here?
Debora
	I knew you'd come and rescue me sooner or later, %a000090.
Debora
	But you shouldn't have!
Debora
	You've played right into their hands!
	That's why they used the Chancellor and kidnapped me. It was to lure you here.
Debora
	The ringleader is planning to kill you and then become king in your place!
