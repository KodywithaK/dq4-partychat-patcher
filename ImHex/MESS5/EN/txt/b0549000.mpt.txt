	Wow! So this is the Realm of the Faeries! It's really different to our world.
%0%a001240
	There are monsters here too, right? We should mind where we go.
%0%a001250
	Look, Dad! The sky's white! Why do you think that is? It's really odd!
%0%a001250
	Is that pretty pink flower over there a cherry blossom? You can smell it from here.
Sancho
	I no know esuch places like thees are een the world. Qué? Ees no the world? Ees a different world? Heh heh. You like to trick me, sí?

	Where do you suppose the Faerie Palace is? I can't see any lake surrounded by mountains around here.
%0%a001240
	You came here when you were little, right, Dad?
	Did you see the Faerie Palace then?
%0%a001250
	La la la la... Being here makes me feel all happy.
	I want to skip about the place!
%0%a001250
	Can we stay here a bit longer, Dad? Not many people get the chance to come to the Realm of the Faeries.
Sancho
	I no believe eet. These tiny peoples, the faeries, they are real!
Sancho
	Eh! Why you have eso many esecrets from your Uncle Sancho, friend? You no trust me?
	Thees makes me eso esad.
Tuppence
	How odd. I've just realised that we've been
	walking around for quite a while now, and yet
	it's still daytime.
Tuppence
	Faeries are rather sweet. I wonder if I could persuade one to come and live with me as my bride.

	What do you suppose it means to change the flow of time? I don't really get it.
%0%a001240
	Treacle and the other faeries can't know about the gold bauble, right?
%0%a001240
	Okay. I didn't want to let you down by not keeping it a secret.
%0%a001250
	I don't think we're on the right track here, Dad.
	We should go back to the Faerie Palace.
%0%a001250
	I think I understand what the leader of the faeries was saying. You can do it, right, Dad?
%0%a001240
	Here we are again! You really like T 'n' T,
	don't you, Dad?
%0%a001240
	There's just one island here, right? There aren't any others floating about the place?
%0%a001250
	There's a white mist just above the water.
	I thought the sea itself was white at first!
%0%a001250
	I seem to become a real chatterbox whenever we come here.
%0%a001250
	Ooh, a little bird! Hello there, birdie!
Sancho
	Qué? We estill have the theengs to do here?
	Okay. Then we do them rápido, sí?
Sancho
	You no forget esometheeng, friend?
	You must check to make esure.
	Ees better to be esafe than esorry, no?
Tuppence
	I always feel terribly agitated when we come here. Maybe it's just the magic effect the Realm of the Faeries has on me.
Tuppence
	I could be walking along when a faerie jumps out from behind a tree and bumps right into me.
Tuppence
	It could be love at first sight! These things have been known to happen, you know!
Bianca
	It's lovely and warm here. And it smells so good too.
Bianca
	You came here to try and get Zenithia afloat again, didn't you? Sorry I couldn't be of any help.
Nera
	It feels like time has an unhurried pace all of its
	own here.
Nera
	It's a shame we don't have time to relax, but we have to get on.
