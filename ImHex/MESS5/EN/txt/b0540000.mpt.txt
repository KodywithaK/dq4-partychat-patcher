Bianca
	Um, are you sure we've got time to hang about in a place like this, %a000090? Hadn't we better hurry?
Bianca
	Looking at the river rush by takes me back to bein' a little girl. I wonder why.
Nera
	You must have a lot of memories here. But we should really try not to dawdle too much.
Nera
	This place never changes. The water smells just like it always has. And so does the grass.
%0%a001240
	Wow! What a cool river! It runs into the sea, right? How amazing!
%0%a001250
	The water's so clear. It'd be lovely to swim in.
Sancho
	Eef I just esay I go together weeth heem to Coburg that day...
Sancho
	No. Ees too late now.
%0%a001240
	I wish I had friends. Then I could spend all the time playing about and having fun.
%0%a001250
	It's a shame you didn't age at all when you were a statue, Dad. I wish I could be a grown-up soon.
Sancho
	I no esay I blame everyone een Coburg, but esometimes I theenk like thees...
Sancho
	Eef you and your father, you were no esummoned to Coburg on thees day,
	maybe señor Pankraz, he, he...
Bianca
	I s'pose we should look on the bright side. At least we didn't age in all those years we were statues, eh?
Nera
	Yes, we must look just like we did all those years ago before we were turned into stone.
Tuppence
	I wonder why that soldier was posted all the way out here. Don't they need his sort over at the castle?
%0%a001240
	Don't you have a Whealbrook bluestone, Dad?
%0%a001240
	Whealbrook's the place you spent a bit of time when you were little, isn't it? Maybe we should go there and see if we can find some bluestones ourselves!
%0%a001250
	I read about Whealbrook bluestone in a book once. There used to be lots of it about in caves long ago.
%0%a001240
	That old woman's elder sister must be even more of an old woman than she is!
%0%a001250
	I love tombolas! Have you got any tombola tickets, Dad? Can we go sometime? Pretty please!
%0%a001250
	You can hear the water running by. It makes me feel all calm and relaxed.
%0%a001240
	We're under the river now, aren't we? I wonder how they made this tunnel. You don't think it'll collapse or anything, do you?
Sancho
	I remember now. Many years ago, there was an old señor on the Coburg eside of the river who espent hees time just looking eento the water.
Sancho
	I wonder how he ees now.
Bianca
	Comin' here reminds me of the time I moved from Roundbeck all them years ago. Time flies, eh?
Nera
	This is where we first met, isn't it? How the years have flown by since then!
%0%a001240
	Do boats come here? Have you been on one, Dad? That's so cool! I want to go on a boat!
	Take me on a boat!
%0%a001250
	The sea is such a pretty colour. And look at how the waves rock up and down.
Sancho
	Ees eso near to Whealbrook here. Ees a place weeth very painful memories for me.
Tuppence
	What an oversight! We should've brought an artist along with us, %a000090.
Tuppence
	Then I could have had lots of lovely heroic portraits done of me on my travels to keep for posterity!
Bianca
	Isn't her poor husband that bloke who was always sleepin'? How did he end up comin' a cropper?
Nera
	The poor woman, losing a loved one like that. Just the thought of it makes me feel utterly wretched.
%0%a001240
	Prince Albert always said it's important to help a person who's in distress.
%0%a001240
	Maybe it'll be a help to that woman if we defeat Nimzo. We have to at least try, Dad!
%0%a001250
	Not all monsters are bad. People don't realise that. But it is a shame for that woman.
Sancho
	Uf! Ees eso esad!
	You must do esometheeng, My Majesty.
	You must return the world to peace.
Bianca
	Comin' here reminds me of the time I moved from Roundbeck all them years ago. Time flies, eh?
Nera
	This is where we first met, isn't it? How the years have flown by since then!
%0%a001240
	It's too dark to see where the path ends and the sea starts. We'd better watch that we don't fall in!
%0%a001250
	I'm sleepy.
Sancho
	Ees no polite to visit people at night.
Sancho
	We leave and come again tomorrow, okay?
%0%a001250
	Oh dear. It looks like she's having an upsetting dream.
Nera
	I wonder how long she'll go on feeling so terrible.
Sancho
	Ees always the esad theengs you esee een your dreams. Sí, sí. I understand.
Bianca
	It always makes me feel sad comin' here.
Nera
	All those years have passed, and yet this place has hardly changed at all.
%0%a001240
	We looked all over for you with Sancho, but we never came here.
%0%a001240
	He said this is the one place he wanted to avoid.
%0%a001240
	This place must be full of memories for you and Sancho. You spent time with Grandpa here too.
	I do know, you know.
%0%a001250
	If you're feeling sad, it's okay to cry. I'll cry with you if it makes you feel better.
%0%a001250
	...I can't breathe very well. Being here... It's very hard for some reason.
Sancho
	You know, I tell myself I never come here again.
Sancho
	But ees okay. Now I have you weeth me.
	Ees much happier thees time.
Sancho
	You know, friend, I came after you and your father when you left Whealbrook for Coburg that day. I had a bad feeling een my heart.
Sancho
	But when I arrived een Coburg, already señor Pankraz, he was no there. I tried to find heem, but ees no good.
Sancho
	When I came back and heard the news, I, I... (sob)
Tuppence
	What a travesty! There was no need for such rampant vandalism. I'm sure it used to be a lovely little village.
Tuppence
	I'm sure this place will be back to its old self one day, %a000090. Where there are people, there's life.
%0%a001240
	Do you know that man, Dad? He's really old!
%0%a001250
	It's sad seeing someone so old and doddery.
%0%a001240
	This is a pretty little church. Maybe they decided to spare it because it's a sacred place.
%0%a001250
	I need to say lots of prayers. That way all the people who died here will find their way safely
	to the Goddess.
Tuppence
	What a lovely young filly! It's like seeing a beautiful rose in the middle of a wilderness.
%0%a001240
	Well, well! That slime seems to be fairly clued up, considering he lives in a well!
%0%a001250
	That slime is really cute!
%0%a001240
	Are we staying here tonight? Go on, let's!
Sancho
	Sí, thees ees...
	Uf, ees been esuch a long time.
Bianca
	Quite right. We have %a001240 and %a001250 to make us proud. We should be happy!
Nera
	We had a terrible time of it too when we were turned into stone, but at least we can be grateful that our children were well looked-after.
%0%a001240
	We're both fine. You don't need to worry about us, so cheer up!
%0%a001250
	Their place was set on fire? Their beds and clothes and money and everything? How terrible!
Sancho
	I no believe eet!
	Ees the señora from the inn!
	Eshe, eshe ees alive! Oh, ees, ees... (blub)
%0%a001240
	A cave! Did you go exploring in there when you were little, Dad? Heh heh! So you liked adventures just like I do, then!
%0%a001250
	Have you ever seen a Whealbrook bluestone, Dad?
	No? That's a pity.
Sancho
	Ees possible to make a fine gemstone from thees Whealbrook bluestone, you know.
Sancho
	When there were no eso many monsters een
	thees cave, many, many people, they came
	here to find eet.
Bianca
	Looks like customers are pretty thin on the ground
	'round here! I hope the people runnin' this place
	don't lose heart.
Nera
	If you don't mind, I think we should try to support this place and stay here as often as we can.
%0%a001240
	Is she the only child here in the village? Maybe I should offer to be her playmate for a while.
%0%a001240
	So this is the cellar of your old house. No way! You went from here to the Realm of the Faeries!? Wow!
Sancho
	Ees no eso different from before.
	Thees ees the only place that was no destroyed. Ees, ees... (sob)
%0%a001230
	Who would've thought pretty flowers like this would blossom in a place so dark?
Sancho
	No! Ees no possible... Thees blossom, ees the esame one from eso many years ago?
Bianca
	It always makes me feel sad comin' here.
Nera
	All those years have passed, and yet this place has hardly changed at all.
%0%a001240
	We looked all over for you with Sancho, but we never came here.
%0%a001240
	He said this is the one place he wanted to avoid.
%0%a001240
	This place must be full of memories for you and Sancho. You spent time with Grandpa here too.
	I do know, you know.
%0%a001250
	If you're feeling sad, it's okay to cry. I'll cry with you if it makes you feel better.
%0%a001250
	...I can't breathe very well. Being here... It's very hard for some reason.
Sancho
	You know, I tell myself I never come here again.
Sancho
	But ees okay. Now I have you weeth me.
	Ees much happier thees time.

Sancho

Sancho
	When I came back and heard the news, I, I... (sob)
Tuppence
	What a travesty! There was no need for such rampant vandalism. I'm sure it used to be a lovely little village.
Tuppence
	When things are peaceful again, everyone in
	Gotha should band together to get this place
	back on its feet!
Tuppence
	I know! We could get the folk from Coburg on board too. The more, the merrier!
%0%a001240
	Do you know that man, Dad? He's really old!
%0%a001250
	Does that old man have to stay in bed all the time?
	Do you think he's alright?
%0%a001240
	Hey! That's a bit like how Sancho brought us up,
	isn't it?
%0%a001240
	Then that means these two are family.
%0%a001250
	Um, can I sleep in with you tonight, please, Dad?
%0%a001240
	Are we staying here tonight? Go on, let's!
Sancho
	Sí, thees ees...
	Uf, ees been esuch a long time.
%0%a001240
	(yawn) Looking at the bed has made me sleepy all of a sudden.
Tuppence
	That's a very comfortable-looking bed for a place like this.
%0%a001250
	I'm sleepy, Dad. I want to go to bed.
Bianca
	You helped a bloke who got stuck here lookin' for medicinal herbs once, right, %a000090?
Bianca
	I know all about it, see. He was well impressed
	with you, a brave little kid goin' into a cave with
	so many monsters.
Bianca
	The first time I came in here was just after
	them soldiers from Coburg burnt Whealbrook
	to the ground.
Bianca
	I thought maybe I'd find you in here hidin', you see.
Nera
	You must've been a born adventurer to come playing in this cave when you were such a small boy!
Nera
	So this is where you used to play when you were small. I used to always play at the La Guardia lookout tower.
Nera
	I used to be scolded terribly by Papa if he ever caught me there.
%0%a001240
	Did you come exploring in this cave all by
	yourself, Dad?
%0%a001240
	You were a lot younger than me then, weren't you? You must've been really brave!
%0%a001240
	This cave is amazing.
%0%a001240
	I wonder if it was dug out by all of the people who came here looking for Whealbrook bluestones.
%0%a001250
	Um, you won't go annoying the monsters in here too much, will you, Dad?
%0%a001250
	The water in here is really pretty. I wonder where it comes from.
Sancho
	Señor Pankraz, he came here all the time.
	I used to make for heem the packed lunch.
	Sí, sí... I remember eet like yesterday.
Sancho
	The people from the village, they no come near the cave because they were afraid of monsters.
Sancho
	Thees ees why señor Pankraz, he can continue hees research and no one knows notheeng.
Sancho
	The flames, they no can come een here, eh?
	Ees just like eet was before.
Tuppence
	I was expecting a rather bigger cave, given the way you spoke about it.
Tuppence
	I suppose things always seem bigger to you
	as a child.
Tuppence
	It feels very damp in here. I wonder if it's because of the river.
Bianca
	This must be where Pankraz did all his research about the legendary hero.
Nera
	This place seems to have a kind of warm atmosphere to it somehow.
%0%a001240
	Is this Grandpa's secret room? It's really cool! Maybe I should have a secret room too!
%0%a001250
	Grandpa Pankraz...
Sancho
	Ees the first time I esee thees room.
	Señor Pankraz, he, he...
Tuppence
	So this is the research chamber of the mighty King Pankraz! Ooh, I feel quite overwhelmed!
Debora
	How long are you planning on carrying on with this trip down memory lane, %a000090?
Debora
	You have an important task to take care of, remember. It's time to move on.
Debora
	Well, we were stuck as statues for all those years. Huh! Being reminded of that really irritates me.
Debora
	Being here certainly takes me back. It's time we stopped looking to the past now, though.
Debora
	You'd better not ever put me in that position, %a000090. I'd never forgive you if you did.
Debora
	It's chilly by the water at night. And no, I wasn't saying that so you'd come and warm me up, %a000090.
Debora
	You'd better not ever put me in that position, %a000090. I'd never forgive you if you did.
Debora
	It's been so long, and yet there still aren't enough people here to rebuild the town.
Debora
	Never mind, %a000090. When the world's at peace again, people will flock here because of its connection to me, and then it will all be okay.
Debora
	I was so angry when I was turned into a statue. They could at least have made it a gold one.
Debora
	It was that anger that kept me going, though.
	Anger and the determination to have my revenge.
Debora
	If you want to stay here, I don't have a problem with that. Stay whenever you like.
Debora
	It's strange to see flowers blossoming in such a dark place. I wonder who planted them here.
Debora
	It's been so long, and yet there still aren't enough people here to rebuild the town.
Debora
	Never mind, %a000090. When the world's at peace again, people will flock here because of its connection to me, and then it will all be okay.
Debora
	You certainly love your caves, don't you, %a000090? I can't believe you used to come in here when you were little.
Debora
	We've been married a long time now, but I still don't think I'll ever be able to share your love of caves.
Debora
	Caves are damp and smelly and dark and claustrophobic, and there's never any sunshine...
Debora
	It doesn't matter that I'm clearly married to a cave fanatic. I still don't see myself ever liking them.
Debora
	So this is where your father carried out his research on the legendary hero.
Debora
	I wonder if it's fate that you're here now with your own son.
