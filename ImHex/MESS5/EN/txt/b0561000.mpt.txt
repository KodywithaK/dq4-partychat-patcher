Sancho
	But ees a family moment.
	Esometheeng must be very important.
Tuppence
	How marvellous! Ha ha ha!
Sancho
	Okay, ees time to go to esee señor Albert now. Your wife esay ees okay, no?
Tuppence
	Ooh! ⓗI love youⓘ! Those words are like music to the ears. If only someone would play that tune for me...
Sancho
	I know %a001240, he ees the legendary hero, but he ees estill a boy. Maybe he pushed heemself too hard.
Sancho
	You must have muchos to esay to señora %a001230, but now you leave her alone weeth the children for esome time, okay?
Tuppence
	I do believe that's the first time I've ever seen %a001240 cry.
Sancho
	Heh heh heh! Sí, sí! You know, eh, friend?
Tuppence
	Yes, indeed. Bianca really is quite a beauty.
Sancho
	(sniff) I, I... No! Ees no the time for tears now. Come. We, we must go...
Tuppence
	I must admit that I'm beginning to feel a bit
	t-tearful myself.
Sancho
	The first theeng to do ees to esee what señor Albert, he needs to esay to you.
Tuppence
	I wonder what it is that Prince Albert wants. Ooh! Maybe he wants to give you some money!
Sancho
	But ees a family moment.
	Esometheeng must be very important.
Tuppence
	How marvellous! Ha ha ha!
Sancho
	Okay, ees time to go to esee señor Albert now. Your wife esay ees okay, no?
Tuppence
	Ooh! ⓗI love youⓘ! Those words are like music to the ears. If only someone would play that tune for me...
Sancho

Tuppence
	I do believe that's the first time I've ever seen %a001240 cry.
Sancho
	Heh heh heh! Sí, sí! You know, eh, friend?
Tuppence
	Yes, Nera is very pure and gentle. A true lady.
Sancho
	(sniff) I, I... No! Ees no the time for tears now. Come. We, we must go...
Tuppence
	I must admit that I'm beginning to feel a bit
	t-tearful myself.
Sancho
	The first theeng to do ees to esee what señor Albert, he needs to esay to you.
Tuppence
	I wonder what it is that Prince Albert wants. Ooh! Maybe he wants to give you some money!
Sancho
	Señor Albert, he ees a wise man.
	What he esays to you, maybe ees right.
Sancho
	But for me, I no forget your father's dying weesh. He ask you to find your mother.
Sancho
	So eef you are going esomewhere now, your Uncle Sancho, he go weeth you.
	Wherever eet ees.
Tuppence
	There's no point in just staying here to
	protect Gotha.
Tuppence
	If you rescue Queen Mada and join forces with her, then you'll be able to bring true peace to the world.
%0%a001240
	It was Grandma who turned Mum back to normal
	for us, right? Then we should definitely try to rescue her!
Bianca
	Old Bertie really cares about the people of
	Gotha, eh?
Bianca
	But you'd only regret it if you gave up on your
	plans and stayed here. I'm sure the people understand that.
Nera
	It's not nice having to fib about our plans to leave, but I'm sure everyone will forgive us and see we had no choice.
Tuppence
	Everyone seems rather jittery.
Bianca
	It can give you doubts about leavin' when folk say stuff like that, eh? But we have to go.
Bianca
	That's true. Pankraz asked you to save your mum when he was lyin' there on the brink of death.
Bianca
	What d'you reckon, %a000090? Dun't you think we should take Sancho with us, as he's offerin' an' all?
Nera
	Sancho always gets a misty look in his eyes when he talks about Pankraz.
Nera
	They must have been very close friends, the two
	of them.
%0%a001240
	Sancho doesn't want to be too pushy, but I know he'd really like to join you if you'll have him.
%0%a001250
	I hope we find Grandma soon. I can't wait to see Sancho look a bit more relaxed at last.
Bianca
	You lot are responsible for that, right? Sounds like you were pretty busy while I was just standin' there as a statue.
Nera
	Well, we already know about that, don't we?
	You're the one who resurrected it, no doubt?
%0%a001240
	I wonder how he found out about that all the
	way out here. Scholars like him always seem
	to know everything!
%0%a001250
	How do you suppose he'd react if we took him there and showed him what it was like? He he he!
Bianca
	I wonder when the day will finally come that you can just sit on your throne and enjoy bein' king, eh?
Bianca
	I dunno, though. I'm not sure that just sittin'
	about the place every day would really be
	your cup of tea.
Nera
	I should imagine it's been many a year since that throne's been sat on. It has something of a lonely
	air about it.
%0%a001240
	Mum's just as I imagined she'd be!
%0%a001240
	I'd never realised until now how nice it is to have a mum around.
%0%a001250
	Mum's really nice, isn't she? She knows what I'm thinking even before I say anything. It's great to have her back.
Sancho
	Eef you estay here een the castle too long, friend, all the people of Gotha, they are gonna be eso esad when you have to leave.
Sancho
	You must leave now, before they are used to eseeing you here. Er...My Majesty.
Tuppence
	Nothing to report here, sir! ...Oops! Sorry.
	I was in patrol mode for some reason.
Bianca
	It's funny, but just bein' in this room again makes me feel all relaxed.
Bianca
	There are lots of memories here, good ones and bad. I reckon that's what makes the place feel so warm.
Nera
	The children must've spent their days here during all that time we were away.
Nera
	The room's full of memories that we were never a part of.
%0%a001240
	Can we hurry up and get going soon, please, Dad? Grandma's waiting!
%0%a001250
	The next time I get scared during the night, I can come and find Mum. How nice!
Sancho
	Ees good to find out the informations, friend,
	but you can no estand around for too long now, okay?
Tuppence
	I would never have imagined being able to enter the King's quarters in the past.
Tuppence
	Only the very best soldiers are even allowed to guard the place, let alone just wander on in!
Bianca
	It's lovely to see how happy people are on
	my account.
Nera
	Oh dear. People are so happy we're back, and yet we're about to go off and leave them again.
Nera
	We'll be sure to come back safely this time, though.
%0%a001240
	It's all because we tried so hard, right? If you try hard, you can do anything.
Sancho
	Sí, friend. You have worked eso hard.
	But our quest, ees no over yet.
Bianca
	Aah, en't that sweet? Fancy her cryin' like that as if it was her own family!
Bianca
	No one's goin' to split us up again, that much is
	for sure.
Nera
	We have her to thank for bringing up %a001240 and %a001250 for us. We really are indebted to her.
%0%a001240
	Looking at her all emotional like that makes me feel like crying again.
%0%a001250
	(sniff...sniff) No, I'm not sad. I'm not crying, honest!
Bianca
	%0%a001250's just a little girl, and we mustn't put her in any more danger than we have already.
Bianca
	Still, it's sad to have to part with her again, even if it's just for a bit.
Nera
	Are we not taking %a001250 with us, darling? No, I suppose it would be too tough on a little girl.
Nera
	It'll be sad to leave her, but we can always come back and visit. We just have to be strong and do what's needed of us.
%0%a001240
	We have to take %a001250 with us, Dad!
	Family should stick together!
Sancho
	Ees eso hard to esee %a001250 look eso esad.
Sancho
	I pray to the Goddess that the world, ees gonna be at peace again esoon, and you can all be together like a proper family.
Tuppence
	Good heavens! What an honour it is for you to choose me to accompany you when you're leaving %a001250 behind!
Tuppence
	Have no fear! I'll be sure to make myself of greater use to you than she would be so that you don't regret your decision.
Bianca
	It's still hard to get your head 'round. To think our little baby, %a001240, has grown up to be the legendary hero!
Nera
	%0%a001240 seems so grown-up already. It's hard to imagine he's the same person as that tiny baby.
%0%a001250
	How come you're not taking %a001240 with you?
%0%a001250
	I'm not sure I'll be very happy without him around.
Sancho
	Ees true that %a001240, he ees the legendary hero, but he ees the Prince of Gotha too.
Sancho
	Maybe ees a good idea to leave heem here,
	just een case esometheeng happens to...
	No. No, ees bad luck to esay these theengs.
Tuppence
	Good heavens! What an honour it is for you to choose me to accompany you when you're leaving %a001240 behind!
Tuppence
	Have no fear! I'll be sure to make myself of greater use to you than he would be so that you don't regret your decision.
%0%a001240
	Come on, Dad! You heard her. We should go and see Patty the party planner.
%0%a001240
	It's always been my dream for us all to travel together as a family.
%0%a001250
	You've gone all red, Dad. You must be happy that Mum said she loved you, though.
Sancho
	Uf! Perdón. I am een the way, sí?
	You old Don Juan!
Tuppence
	Ooh! How romantic! Don't you worry about me. Just carry on with the lovey-dovey routine, I would!
%0%a001240
	Come on, Dad! You heard her. We should go and see Patty the party planner.
%0%a001250
	I'd rather Mum was with us too, Dad.
%0%a001240
	Come on, Dad! You heard her. We should go and see Patty the party planner.
%0%a001240
	It's always been my dream for us all to travel together as a family.
%0%a001250
	You've gone all red, Dad. You must be happy that Mum said she loved you, though.
Sancho
	Uf! Perdón. I am een the way, sí?
	You old Don Juan!
Tuppence
	Ooh! How romantic! Don't you worry about me. Just carry on with the lovey-dovey routine, I would!
%0%a001240
	Mum's amazing. I thought I'd have to be there to protect her, but she doesn't need it.
%0%a001240
	In fact, I feel a lot safer just having her by my side.
%0%a001250
	I'd rather Mum was with us too, Dad.
Bianca
	Now we're all ready, it's time we got goin'.
	Off to the underworld to find your mum!
%0%a001240
	You're cool, Dad! I always knew you'd go off and rescue Grandma as soon as you had the chance.
%0%a001250
	Do you think it's all dark and scary in the underworld? Even if it is, we have to go.
	We have to save Grandma.
Sancho
	Ees no an easy decision to make, sí?
	To leave your kingdom and your people behind.
Sancho
	Sí. Señor Pankraz, he was een the esame galleon.
Tuppence
	Gotha really is the most splendid place to be.
Tuppence
	Er, sorry! I didn't mean I don't want to join you on your travels, Your Majesty!
Bianca
	No matter what old Bertie might say, I'm sure that deep down he knows you have to leave.
Bianca
	I wonder what'll happen to our world if the Grandmaster comes rampagin' out from the underworld.
Bianca
	We'd better put a stop to him before it comes to that, eh, %a000090?
Nera
	To think that your poor mother is having to hold that creature back all by herself.
Nera
	We have to hurry to her and help her!
%0%a001240
	The Grandmaster of the Underworld... He's the one who's making Grandma suffer.
%0%a001240
	We have to defeat him and rescue her, Dad.
	I know we can do it!
%0%a001250
	I'm not scared of monsters, but I don't like the Grandmaster of the Underworld. He sounds
	really mean.
%0%a001250
	All the monsters are scared of him, you know.
	What a horrible creature he must be!
Bianca
	I've never really had the chance to look around the castle much. When I was here all them years ago,
	I spent most of the time in bed!
Nera
	So this is where Patty and Monty do their work.
Nera
	It's nice to have so many people helping the cause.
%0%a001240
	Hurry up, Dad! Let's get our stuff ready and
	get going!
%0%a001250
	I hoped you'd decide to take me with you, Dad.
%0%a001250
	I'm going to try really hard so that you don't ever feel like I'm in the way.
Sancho
	Ah, friend. I am eso happy you ask me to accompany you on your journey!
	Eso, eso happy!
Sancho
	Now, you no forget what I always tell you. You must pack medicinal herbs and the wings of the chimaera, okay?
Tuppence
	My fellow soldiers seem to be glaring at me somewhat. I must make sure I do my bit, for their sakes.
Bianca
	It's bin a while since I've had a compliment like that.
	I dun't know what to do with myself!
Nera
	Am I really beautiful? People usually just describe me as kind or sweet. I don't think anyone's actually called me beautiful before.
%0%a001240
	Brilliant! It'll be fun travelling around together
	again, Dad.
%0%a001250
	Yay! Thanks, Dad. I won't let you down.
Sancho
	Gracias, friend. Ees eso good to be travelling together again. Olé! Let's go!
Tuppence
	It's an honour to be summoned, Your Majesty.
	I'll endeavour not to be a burden to you.
Bianca
	Thanks for bringin' me on board. It'll be fun to travel about together again, eh?
Nera
	I'm so happy, darling! Now we need never be apart.
%0%a001240
	Sancho says he's really strong when it comes to drinking. Does that man's head hurt because he's
	too weak?
Tuppence
	Honestly! Does the man have no shame, admitting to such a thing in the presence of His Majesty!?
%0%a001250
	If that's what happens, then there's no way I'm ever going to drink, even when I'm all grown up.
Bianca
	D'you reckon it's wise to leave the safety of the kingdom in their, ahem, capable hands?
Nera
	He seems to be suffering rather a lot. I'm afraid there's not much we can do for him, though.
%0%a001240
	Cousin Gertie and %a001250 are really good friends, you know.
%0%a001250
	I often used to get Cousin Gertie to tell me what it was like before she became a princess. We had lots of fun chatting!
%0%a001250
	He he! Cousin Gertie's as full of beans as ever!
Tuppence
	Princess Gertrude is actually not far from being my ideal woman. What man wouldn't find such a candid, lively beast attractive?
Sancho
	The truth ees, señorita Gertrude, eshe makes eso much trouble for señor Albert.
Sancho
	Ees good for heem eef we finish our quest esoon. Then he can have the siesta, sí?
Bianca
	I'm afraid we'll be placin' quite a burden on
	Bertie again.
Bianca
	Not that Gertie seems too bothered, eh?
Nera
	Oh dear. Now I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing that we're leaving the castle again.
%0%a001240
	If there are so few people left, do you think it's okay for us to just leave the castle?
%0%a001240
	I suppose the best thing for everyone will be if we manage to find Grandmaster Nimzo and defeat
	him, though.
Sancho
	When the news comes that King %a000090 and Queen %a001230, they are okay, everyone ees gonna come back to Gotha.
Tuppence
	I do hope he hasn't given you any cause for concern there, Your Majesty.
Tuppence
	Just leave the defence of Gotha in the capable hands of my comrades, and don't you worry!
%0%a001240
	There was a gemstone in the village you used to live in? I want to go and find it!
%0%a001250
	I wonder if we'd find this famous craftsman if we went to Whealbrook. Maybe he's already moved
	on somewhere else.
Bianca
	I had no idea there was any gemstone lurkin'
	in Whealbrook.
%0%a001240
	It'd be nice to bring the old man home to his son one day, wouldn't it?
%0%a001250
	It's nice that he knows his dad's alive now. I can understand what a big relief that must be.
%0%a001240
	You must be desperate to find your mum just like I was desperate to find mine.
%0%a001250
	Grandma was good at making friends with monsters, right, Dad? Just like you are.
%0%a001250
	I really want to meet her.
Sancho
	Ees a fine idea, friend! Please, you do thees for your Uncle Sancho, sí?
%0%a001240
	That woman usually lives up in the sky, doesn't she? She's really pretty.
%0%a001250
	We used to visit that lady every once in a while,
	but she'd never talk to us.
%0%a001250
	I'm really happy that she will now.
Tuppence
	I had no idea that there was a Zenithian living in the castle until you brought me here, Your Majesty.
Tuppence
	I should imagine most other folk don't realise, either. A beautiful woman like that would be surrounded by admirers if they did!
Sancho
	Ees heartening to hear these words, no?
	Now I feel ready to go! Olé!
%0%a001240
	It's good that you and %a001250 and Grandma are all so friendly with monsters.
%0%a001240
	Maybe I should try befriending a slime or something one of these days.
Bianca
	It's nice to see the place all lively as usual.
Nera
	It still feels almost unreal to be able to walk around like this again.
%0%a001240
	Everyone's really happy because Mum came home safe and sound!
%0%a001240
	The people here all really love you two, you know.
%0%a001250
	I really love Gotha! Everyone's so nice and
	friendly here.
Sancho
	Ees more and more busy een the castle esince Queen %a001230, eshe returned to Gotha.
Sancho
	Sí, sí! Ees esuch a fine feeling.
	I am eso, eso happy!
Tuppence
	Ooh! I'm sure Mother will be terribly proud to see me accompanying His Majesty like this.
Bianca
	You can't complain about a reception like that, eh?
Nera
	It's incredibly flattering that people are so pleased to see me back. I was only here for such a short
	time before.
%0%a001240
	That dog really loves %a001250. He wags his tail much more when he sees her than when he sees me.
%0%a001240
	%0%a001250 reckons she can understand what animals are saying, you know.
%0%a001250
	I love animals! All animals!
Tuppence
	That dog's been around ever since I was a young boy. He must be a fair old age by now.
%0%a001240
	You were a statue for eight years and Mum was a statue for ten years, right, Dad?
%0%a001240
	That means we were looking for Mum together for two whole years!
%0%a001250
	Mum must have been so lonely, spending ten years all by herself like that. We should spend lots of time with her from now on to make up for it.
Sancho
	Ten years? Uf, ees a long time.
	Eso many theengs have happened.
	Your Uncle Sancho, he ees no eso young now.
Bianca
	It's hard to believe so much time passed, eh?
Bianca
	It dun't feel that long somehow.
	Is it the same for you, %a000090?
Nera
	Yes, the children must be ten years old already. They're getting quite grown-up now.
Nera
	I know there's nothing to be done about it, but
	I do wish I'd been there to see them in their
	younger years.
%0%a001240
	We don't have any choice but to go to Nadiria, though. Not if we want to save Grandma.
%0%a001250
	I wonder if there's anyone about who does know how you get there.
Sancho
	But we no geeve up! All the questions we ask, they are like the grains of rice. Alone, ees notheeng. But together, they make the paella!
Sancho
	Thees Tuppence, he no eseem like a bad señor, no?
	Why don't you ask heem to accompany you?
%0%a001240
	Tuppence is one of the guards who's always patrolling the castle. I remember his name because
	it sounds a bit funny!
%0%a001240
	I quite like Tuppence. We should take him along with us again!
Sancho
	You see, friend. You are loved by everyone.
	Thees señor, he knows how great you are.
Sancho
	You eshould ask heem to accompany you again, no?
Sancho
	I ask myself, ⓗWhy you no esee thees chess no more, Sancho?ⓘ, and now I know. Ees because señor Tuppence, he has eet all the time.
Sancho
	And ees true. Sí, sí. I remember the look een the men's eyes when they play thees chess.
	Esometheeng was no right.
%0%a001250
	I find that chess set a bit scary for some reason. You won't leave me alone with it, will you, Dad?
%0%a001240
	I didn't wet the bed today, Dad! Ahem!
%0%a001250
	You sleep all nice and quietly, Dad. %0%a001240 moves about all the time and makes a terrible noise.
Tuppence
	It's quite amusing staying in one's own home under these circumstances.
Nera
	It's a little bit embarrassing being allowed to stay in the place without paying.
%0%a001240
	We never really stayed here very much.
	We should say yes next time.
%0%a001250
	You seem a bit tired, Dad. Are you alright?
	You must rest every now and then, you know.
Tuppence
	If you don't mind the place being rather cramped and shabby, then please do avail yourself of it whenever you wish.
Tuppence
	It's the given duty of a soldier to protect the people of his land.
Tuppence
	And it's the given duty of a man to protect his family. Isn't that right, Your Majesty?
%0%a001240
	Tuppence is right. I wouldn't have expected him to come out with something so deep, though.
%0%a001240
	Lofty Peak's the place we got the magic carpet,
	isn't it?
%0%a001240
	Yeah, I'll bet the people there know all about how to get to Nadiria!
Sancho
	Hmm... You must no ignore thees advice, friend.
Sancho
	Eef you were no listening the first time, you must ask the señorita again.
%0%a001240
	Has that old man been old even since you were little?
%0%a001240
	Wow! Then he must be ancient!
Tuppence
	Oh dear! I do hope he lives to see the day when things are peaceful again.
Bianca
	Three circles? I'll bet one of them is the Circle of Life.
Bianca
	You don't think the other two could be...?
%0%a001250
	Ⓡ La la lah... 
%0%a001240
	We used to stay here every now and then. It's more fun than sleeping at the castle.
%0%a001250
	Sancho always used to make us a delicious paella whenever we came to stay here.
%0%a001250
	But if I ever woke up at night, I'd catch him looking really miserable, so it was a bit worrying sometimes.
Sancho
	Eef you would like to be esafe eenside the castle, you must keep watching outside.
Sancho
	Señor Albert, he ask me to estay eenside, but ees my duty to be on guard here.
%0%a001240
	Do you think it's okay for guards to be asleep?
Tuppence
	I should imagine that he's no longer on duty for
	the day.
Tuppence
	But he's probably sleeping out here instead of his quarters so that he can be quick to notice if there's trouble afoot.
Sancho
	Ees no eso many people here een Gotha these days.
	The guards, they are working too hard.
Bianca
	I en't sayin' we should just drop everythin' the minute it gets dark, but we do need a bit of a rest.
Bianca
	Maybe we should call it a day for today, eh?
%0%a001240
	It's okay. I'm not sleepy, honest. I can stay awake until it's time to go to bed.
%0%a001250
	I get scared at night. I have dreams about the nasty creatures who kidnapped Mum.
Sancho
	Ees enough for one day, no?
	Ees time for siesta maybe, My Majesty?
Sancho
	Sí, sí. And ees dangerous to walk around at night.
Tuppence
	Aaah, I'm rather tired now. How are you bearing up, %a000090?
Sancho
	Maybe the guards, they are working too much, no? They no have the time for enough siesta.
%0%a001250
	That soldier's really sleepy, but he's still working hard to guard the people of Gotha. What a good man!
Tuppence
	It may be arduous for me sometimes during our travels together, but it's hard work for the soldiers left behind at the castle too.
Tuppence
	I must try my absolute hardest to do my bit!
%0%a001240
	Urgh! Did you see that, Dad?
	That man was dribbling!
%0%a001240
	I'm really sleepy, Dad.
%0%a001250
	I don't care where we stay, Dad. Just as long as
	I can get some sleep soon.
Tuppence
	Do make yourself at home if you wish, Your Majesty.
%0%a001250
	That dog says I look a lot like Grandma Mada.
%0%a001250
	Do you think he's been living here in the castle long enough to know?
%0%a001240
	Looks like everyone's asleep. We'd better keep quiet. We wouldn't want to wake people up.
Tuppence
	Aah! The end of another good day's work!
%0%a001250
	The castle's a bit scary of a night. People say it was night-time when Mum was kidnapped.
Bianca
	Dun't worry, %a001250.
	I promise I en't goin' to leave you again.
Bianca
	It's ever so quiet, eh? Hard to believe it was so bustlin' durin' the day.
Nera
	I feel like my footsteps are making a terrible noise. We must try to walk about the place quietly.
%0%a001250
	That old man always seems to be asleep, even during the day.
%0%a001250
	When we've finished travelling and
	everywhere's peaceful again, it'd be
	nice to take him out somewhere.
Bianca
	Fancy sayin' all that when I'm standin' right here!
Nera
	Well, he certainly knows how to flatter a woman! Mind you, I suppose you haven't changed a bit
	since all those years ago, either.
Tuppence
	I must admit that I'm rather jealous. How wonderful it must be to have a wife who stays so young and beautiful!
%0%a001240
	That man used to be rubbish at singing, but then he practised and got a lot better. Anything's possible!
Tuppence
	My home's not too far away from here, so that man's songs were like lullabies to me in my younger years.
Tuppence
	I sometimes heard him cry out in his sleep too,
	mind you!
%0%a001240
	Don't worry, I won't fall asleep before I get to bed.
%0%a001240
	Mum and I are going to share a bath together
	first too.
Sancho
	Ees too much to work when ees eso late, no?
	The night, ees a time for siesta.
Tuppence
	Patty the party planner is a provocative peach. It gives me palpitations just looking at her.
%0%a001250
	I'm friends with him, but his best human friend is Grandma Mada.
Sancho
	Sí. Ees late. Everyone ees esleeping now. Maybe ees time for us to esleep esoon too, no?
Tuppence
	The end of another fruitful day!
Tuppence
	I'll be sure to mention it in my autobiography.
%0%a001240
	I'm pretty tired now. My feet are killing me.
%0%a001250
	A bath? I'm going to have one with Mum. I'm too old to have one with you now, Dad!
%0%a001240
	Loads of people seem to talk in their sleep.
	I wonder what kinds of things I say.
%0%a001250
	There's no point in him calling for Grandma Mada. She's in Nadiria. You'd think a scholar like him would know that.
%0%a001240
	Sancho always nagged us to clean our teeth
	before bed.
%0%a001240
	He said you used to do it every night without being asked. Is that true, Dad?
%0%a001250
	Hm? What is it...Dad? Zzzz...
Sancho
	Friend! You no forget now! You clean your teeth and do a wee-wee before you go to bed, okay?
Sancho
	You have your own children now, friend.
	They learn from their papá.
Bianca
	I was terrified when I got kidnapped. I was so worried about what would happen to the kids.
Bianca
	It's such a relief to see they grew up safe
	and sound.
Nera
	I'll never forget the day I was reunited with my children at last.
Nera
	I'm sure you have your own plans in mind, but I
	do hope we'll all be able to travel together until the very end.
Bianca
	She's quite a cook, that one, eh?
Bianca
	But it'd be quite nice if I could cook for the kids myself, at least when we're stayin' here in Gotha.
Nera
	That lady is a fine cook.
	Her meals always go down very well.
Nera
	%0%a001250 seems to be quite a fussy eater, though. It would be nice if I could cook for her every once in a while.
%0%a001240
	Yikes! Look at all that food!
	It hardly fits on the table.
%0%a001240
	I reckon I could manage it okay, but %a001250 can be a bit fussy about food.
%0%a001250
	Um, Dad. Is it okay if we stay at the inn instead
	of here?
Bianca
	Hm. He may be the legendary hero, but he's still only young. It's quite a worry takin' him along.
Nera
	Fancy him being awake at this hour! He must be very desperate to join us.
%0%a001250
	How come you're not taking %a001240 with you?
%0%a001250
	I'm not sure I'll be very happy without him around.
Sancho
	Ees true that %a001240, he ees the legendary hero, but he ees the Prince of Gotha too.
Sancho
	Maybe ees a good idea to leave heem here, just een case esometheeng happens to...
	No. No, ees bad luck to esay these theengs.
Tuppence
	Good heavens! What an honour it is for you to choose me to accompany you when you're leaving %a001240 behind!
Tuppence
	Have no fear! I'll be sure to make myself of greater use to you than he would be so that you don't regret your decision.
Bianca
	%0%a001250's just a little girl, and we mustn't put her in any more danger than we have already.
Bianca
	Still, it's sad to have to part with her again, even if it's just for a bit.
Nera
	Are we not taking %a001250 with us, darling? No, I suppose it would be too tough on a little girl.
Nera
	It'll be sad to leave her, but we can always come back and visit. We just have to be strong and do what's needed of us.
%0%a001240
	We have to take %a001250 with us, Dad!
	Family should stick together!
Sancho
	Ees eso hard to esee %a001250 look eso esad.
Sancho
	I pray to the Goddess that the world, ees gonna be at peace again esoon, and you can all be together like a proper family.
Tuppence
	Good heavens! What an honour it is for you to choose me to accompany you when you're leaving %a001250 behind!
Tuppence
	Have no fear! I'll be sure to make myself of greater use to you than she would be so that you don't regret your decision.
%0%a001240
	Come on, Dad! You heard her. We should go and see Patty the party planner.
%0%a001240
	It's always been my dream for us all to travel together as a family.
%0%a001250
	You've gone all red, Dad. You must be happy that Mum said she loved you, though.
Sancho
	Uf! Perdón. I am een the way, sí?
	You old Don Juan!
Tuppence
	Ooh! How romantic! Don't you worry about me. Just carry on with the lovey-dovey routine, I would!
%0%a001240
	Come on, Dad! You heard her. We should go and see Patty the party planner.
%0%a001250
	I'd rather Mum was with us too, Dad.
%0%a001240
	Come on, Dad! You heard her. We should go and see Patty the party planner.
%0%a001240
	It's always been my dream for us all to travel together as a family.
%0%a001250
	You've gone all red, Dad. You must be happy that Mum said she loved you, though.
Sancho
	Uf! Perdón. I am een the way, sí?
	You old Don Juan!
Tuppence
	Ooh! How romantic! Don't you worry about me. Just carry on with the lovey-dovey routine, I would!
%0%a001240
	Mum's amazing.
%0%a001240
	I thought I'd have to be there to protect her,
	but she's always the one looking after me!
%0%a001250
	I'd rather Mum was with us too, Dad.
%0%a001240
	It'd be cool if we could all sleep here together!
	Oh, but there's only one bed...
%0%a001250
	We heard lots of stories here in this house.
	Stories from Sancho's past.
%0%a001250
	I think we probably know everything there is to know about Grandpa Pankraz!
Sancho
	After I left Gotha weeth señor Pankraz, every day I make the dinner.
Sancho
	Ees no easy to look after the young friend when you no used to eet, but when I look back now, ees, ees eso happy times... (sob)
%0%a001250
	Sancho calls out in his sleep sometimes. He always sounds really upset.
%0%a001250
	I really like staying here, but I've seen him call out like that loads of times and it's not very nice.
%0%a001240
	Is Grandpa Pankraz really dead? Can't he come back to life somehow? Poor Sancho seems so sad.
Bianca
	Oh, Sancho, you big softie!
Nera
	Sancho seems really sad.
	Probably more so than we realise.
%0%a001240
	Are we leaving Sancho behind? I'd rather he came along with us.
%0%a001250
	It's a bit lonely without Sancho...
%0%a001250
	Oh, but that doesn't mean I'm not happy to have you around, Dad. Sorry!
Tuppence
	Sancho must be getting on a bit, mustn't he?
	He's still very full of beans, though.
Bianca
	We've always got Sancho on the go, eh? We should probably give him the chance to have a rest every now and then.
Nera
	All Sancho ever seems to think about is Pankraz.
Nera
	I wonder if there's any way of cheering him
	up somehow.
Sancho
	But ees a family moment.
	Esometheeng must be very important.
Tuppence
	How marvellous! Ha ha ha!
Sancho
	Anda! Señora Debora, eshe always have the bad words een her mouth.
Tuppence
	S-So this is Miss Debora...
Tuppence
	G-Goodness me!
	I'm all aflutter!
Sancho
	Sí. When your Uncle Sancho first hear that señora Debora and my young friend are husband and wife, ees, ees, ees esome kind of eshock!
Tuppence
	ⓗEven more harshlyⓘ? I wouldn't mind that. Miss Debora can speak to me any which way she pleases!
Debora
	They've managed fine without you up to now, right?
Debora
	So they'll manage fine again now. Just leave Bertie to take care of things and let's go!
Debora
	You were already planning on rescuing your mother, right? You didn't need Sancho to tell you to.
Debora
	Speaking of Sancho, don't you think we should ask him to come along?
Debora
	Yes, and you're the one who resurrected it!
Debora
	Don't you want to tell him and take the credit?
Debora
	That throne looks nice and comfortable,
	don't you think?
Debora
	Could be a nice place to spend the day once the world's at peace again.
Debora
	This room's almost on a par with my old room
	in Mostroferrato.
Debora
	It's natural that they'd be pleased now their true leader has returned.
Debora
	You're not joining in with her tears there,
	are you, %a000090?
Debora
	Oh! We're not leaving %a001250 behind, are we?
Debora
	%0%a001240 is the legendary hero.
Debora
	And he's my son.
	Sounds about right to me.
%0%a001240
	Dad! Don't you like being with Mum or something?
%0%a001240
	I'd much prefer it if she came with us.
%0%a001250
	How does your relationship work? What was it that you promised Mum all those years ago?
Sancho
	Eh, friend. Thees ees just señora Debora trying no to eshow the embarrassment, sí?
Tuppence
	It sounds rather like Miss Debora thinks of you as some sort of servⓚⓛ
	Er, never mind! Forget I said anything!
%0%a001240
	Devote yourself? To what?
	To keeping Mum safe?
%0%a001240
	In that case, I'll devote myself to her too!
%0%a001250
	Um, Dad... You were really head over heels in love with Mum, weren't you?
Debora
	That Nimzo has some nerve, daring to cause havoc in my world!
Debora
	We didn't get to see this the first time we came.
Debora
	We should have a little look around now we've got the chance.
Debora
	Ha ha! My beauty's always having this kind of effect on people.
Debora
	I'm not keen on having to walk about the place, but I suppose I'll just grin and bear it.
Debora
	I've never drunk to the point that it's given me a headache, so I can't really sympathise with how bad it feels.
Debora
	It seems that fathers the world over have too much to say for themselves.
Debora
	I can never quite get over how unusual Gotha is.
Debora
	You can get excited like that too if you want.
Debora
	I hardly remember anything about it, so it doesn't feel like ten years at all.
Debora
	He seems like he'd make a good servant.
	Let's take him along, %a000090.
Debora
	It's getting late. Let's postpone going out until tomorrow and get some sleep.
Debora
	It's almost a little bit too quiet.
	I wonder where everyone is.
Debora
	ⓗA fine specimenⓘ? I take it he meant to call me
	a beauty.
Debora
	It was the middle of the night when I was snatched, come to think of it.
Debora
	You'd better sleep next to me if you're worried it might happen again. You'll be on the floor, naturally.
Debora
	She's not a bad cook, is she?
Debora
	I reckon she could show Papa's chef a thing or two.
Debora
	He's been along with us before, so I don't see the problem in having him with us again, personally.
Debora
	Oh! We're not leaving %a001250 behind, are we?
Debora
	He could at least try to have happy dreams!
Debora
	Sancho's like an old man sometimes, going on and on about the past.
%0%a001250
	The castle's a bit scary of a night. People say it was night-time when Mum was kidnapped.
Nera
	You mustn't worry yourself, %a001250.
	I won't leave you again, I promise.
%0%a001250
	The castle's a bit scary of a night. People say it was night-time when Mum was kidnapped.
Debora
	Don't worry, %a001250.
	I'm right by your side.
