	This is the home of the forgotten ones.

	You have come to speak with the Elders?
	But the hour is already late.

*: 
	Wahoo! Wahoo! I finally turned into a gooman!
*: 
	I hope my friend Rocket turns into a gooman
	soon too.
*: 
	(shlurp)
*: 
	This is Precaria, the only town in the
	whole of Nadiria.
*: 
	You look pretty young. Bet you were staggrrred to find a town in a place like this, eh?
*: 
	The water around here's holy water, you see. Brought here from the human world by the grrreatⓚⓛ Ahem! 'Scuse me. The great Madalena.
*: 
	If it wasn't for her, we wouldn't even be here.
	She saved us from a precarious fate!
*: 
	Oooh! We don't often see the likes of yooou around here. Surely you're not from the huoooman world, are you?
*: 
	No, that can't be right.
*: 
	You're one of us, aren't you? Saved from your monstrous heart by Madalena's suoooper power.
*: 
	Yes, you'll make a fine huoooⓚⓛ
	Ahem! I mean, a fine human.
*: 
	I bet you wouldn't believe it looking at me now,
	but I used to be a wrecktor, you know.
*: 
	It was all hellfire and brimstone back then.
*: 
	But thanks to Madalena, I'm a balanced,
	well-rounded individual now.
*: 
	A bit too well-rounded if the truth be told.
	And to think, as a priest, I always thought
	gluttony was a sin!
*: 
	Grandmaster Nimzo lives to the north of Precaria, at the summit of the great Mt Zugzwang.
*: 
	He is almighty!
*: 
	Even the so-called legendary hero would be powerless in His presence.
*: 
	I may be human now, but Grandmaster Nimzo remains my master. I will be loyal to the endgame!
*: 
	Strike a light! You went an' found me!
*: 
	But that don't mean you're gettin' the treasure
	I nabbed!
*: 
	Oh, fie! Oh, fie!
*: 
	Be warned, Zenith Dragon!
	Nimzo's might does wax daily.
*: 
	Forsooth, should it not abate, I fear he will break the seal and transcend the limits of Nadiria into the world above.
*: 
	Oh, fie! Oh, fie!
*: 
	I don't know how much longer Madalena can continue to keep Nimzo in check.
*: 
	The spark of life inside her is growing weaker all the time. That much I do know.
*: 
	Something must be done!
	And quickly!
*: 
	What? No, I'm not drinking any booze!
*: 
	A sin like that'll turn me back into a monster again, and I'm not going back down that road!
*: 
	You want something to drink?
	Maybe you'd better not.
*: 
	Or you'll end up regretting it like the man by the water mill.
*: 
	Eee-aw! Do you have any regrets about
	your life?
*: 
	Then you moost have this.
*: 
	It's the Annalum Retentium.
	A book of tales from Precaria!
~ %0%a000120 receives the Annalum Retentium! ~
~ %0%a000180 takes the Annalum Retentium. ~
*: 
	No? Eee-aw, that moost feel good.
*: 
	There was once a man who wanted to
	become a god.
*: 
	But many, many years ago, his evil heart turned him into a monster.
*: 
	The holy people of Lofty Peak set out to drive
	the evil from within him, but it had penetrated his very soul.
*: 
	In the end, they were powerless to help him, and he never returned to his human form.
*: 
	This place was once the great dungeon of Nadiria, the backbone of the underworld.
*: 
	And to the north of here, soaring high into the sky, is the mighty Mt Zugzwang.
*: 
	You would be wise to avoid both, unless you enjoy feeling chills run down your spine.
*: 
	Ah...welcome.
	Welcome to the Nadiria T 'n' T board.
	The reception is upstairs.
~ No response. ~
~ It's just a corpse. ~
*: 
	I tell thee, good %A0110%Xsir%Z%B0110%Xlady%Z, a great treasure lives on Mt Zugzwang. A treasure benamed the ghoulroarer.
*: 
	It is but the conjecture of a long-deceased knight, but I would wager such a ⓚⓛ Clank! ⓚⓛ treasure exists nowhere else in the world.

~ The rockbomb is surveying the situation... ~
*: 
	Baaah! Deeep beneath us, faaar underground, there sleeeps a mighty monster even Grandmaster Nimzo could not defeeeat.
*: 
	But now he waaaits in silent meditaaation.
*: 
	Unless something teeerrible happens, the gates to his realm will remaaain tightly shut.
*: 
	The greeeat Estark is no longer counting sheeep. He is awaaake.
*: 
	If you think you have what it taaakes to shear him, go to the swaaamp in the north.
*: 
	Who goes there?
*: 
	Madalena is offering up a prayer to our exalted Grandmaster Nimzo.
*: 
	He who dares disturb her will pay a hefty price!

	Not a day has gone by since I was snatched away that I haven't thought about you.
Mada
	%0%a000090... You've grown up to be so big
	and strong.
Mada
	Being able to meet with you at last is like a dream come true.
Mada
	Now I can die happy.
Mada
	%0%a000090... Grandmaster Nimzo's powers are stronger than you could possibly imagine.
Mada
	I must do all I can to seal his evil away, even if it means giving my life to do so.
Mada
	Almighty Goddess, please hear my prayer!
Ladja
	Wa ha ha! I am thinking not! Your duty is the opening of door for great Grandmaster Nimzo.
Ladja
	Never minding. It is always extremely touching to observe love of parent for child, after all.
Ladja
	So...the time is at last upon us.
	%0%a000090 and your dear companions...
Ladja
	Not to forgetting the cheeky little legendary hero also in our midsts.
Ladja
	Here is where all of your sweet dreams are
	being extinguished.
Ladja
	Grandmaster Nimzo is no longer requirementing powers of your mother.
Ladja
	So now I am sending parent and child together into eternal world of darkness. It is touching, nyet?
Ladja
	Ooh! You foolishly present yourself before me once more, %a000090.
Ladja
	Not to forgetting the cheeky little legendary hero also in our midsts.

Ladja

Ladja
	So now I am sending parent and child together into eternal world of darkness. Is that not sweet?
Ladja
	Yoy! It is so heatful!
	What is meaning of such light?
Ladja
	Great bishop Ladja cannot be burning from such light. No! It is not possibly!
Ladja
	Waaargh!

Mada
	Hahh... Hahh...
	But I hope I will be able to assist you in
	these final hours.
Mada
	Now, step away, my son.

Zenith Dragon
	Gee gads! That's enough of all this formal

Zenith Dragon
	Maybe it's because I was a human for such a

Zenith Dragon
	Ah ha ha ha diddly ha!
	What? You don't like me like this?
	Lighten up, my faithful friends!

Zenith Dragon
	There's a whole bunch of people just dying to
	meet up with you again back down on good old terraly-firmaly.
Zenith Dragon
	What d'you say I whisk you all down to the ground? I can take you there in a gee-whizz jiffy!
Zenith Dragon
	I wouldn't mind reacquainting myself with the old human element myself.

	Don't diddly-doodly dally too long!
~ But the Zenith Dragon is waiting. ~
*: 
	No sooner is tranquility restored unto the world than the Zenith Dragon becomes derangⓚⓛ
*: 
	No, no. I am quite sure our master has a plan

*: 
	Surely it is not our master's intent to return to his erstwhile human form of Dr Agon?

	Honey says hello to you.
	She's my friend, you know.
*: 
	Sweet joy and candy kisses!
	The world is at peace once more!
*: 
	By the Goddess, these are busy times! Your heroic deeds must be recorded in the annals of history with all haste.

Zenith Dragon
	Still got some things to be getting on with up here?
	Okay, just come see me when you're ready to make like a bee and buzz on down below!
*: 
	I see... You were able to meet with Madalena, though only once.
*: 
	I can well imagine the look of joy on her face at such a long-awaited and happy encounter.
*: 
	The people of Lofty Peak hold your mother in the highest regard, %a000090. We are proud to call her our own.
*: 
	Though her earthly time has passed, she will live on for evermore in your heart.
*: 
	I see... You were able to meet with Madalena, though only once.
*: 
	In days gone by, we held Madalena's magical powers in such awe that we confined her to the prayer room above us.
*: 
	It was your father, Pankraz, who caused a light to shine in that most revered of hearts.
*: 
	We salute your father, %a000090.
	We thank him from the bottom of our hearts.
*: 
	So we were right, Madalena was a great and
	wise woman.
*: 
	For her children and her children's children have saved the world from ruin.
*: 
	It is thanks to you that the world now slumbers in peaceful repose. We thank you. We thank you all.
*: 
	The blissful serenity at the dawn of peace!
	How wonderful to feel it at last.
*: 
	Our thanks to you, %a000090.
	And to your father, Pankraz.
*: 
	The offspring of two lovers who eloped long ago from Lofty Peak have saved the world...
*: 
	What a romantic tale!
*: 
	Now that Nimzo, Grandmaster of Nadiria, has been eliminated, the Crocodilopolis too will surely crumble to dust.
*: 
	For the slaves of the Order of Zugzwang not lucky enough to have escaped, it will be their final resting place. May they at last know peace.
*: 
	Lofty Peak is your home.
*: 
	You shall forever be welcome here.
*: 
	Welcome to the Lofty Peak armour shop!
*: 
	Although...I suppose people won't be needing armour any more, will they? I'll have to change
	my stock!
*: 
	This is the Lofty Peak weapon shop.
*: 
	But the days of weapons and fighting are gone now! Peace reigns!
*: 
	Ah ha ha ha hah!
	I knew you could do it.
	I knew %H0860%Xyou and your friends%Yyou%Z were the ones.
*: 
	I see. So we're finally at peace, are we?
	I never thought I'd see the day.
	How wonderful!
*: 
	How many moons ago must it be now, I wonder...
*: 
	There was another traveller who, like you, stumbled across our village. Lost, he was.
*: 
	Looking back now, that was the start of all this.
*: 
	I swear I'll tell this tale to future generations for as long as the Goddess allows me to.

	And a chip off the old block he is too.
Maria
	Listen to yourself, Harry! You can't say things like that. What about %a001230?
Harry
	Oh, yes. Sorry. A chip off the young and beautiful block in your case, %a001230. You're far too good for %a000090. Always were.
Harry
	Well, anyway, everyone here in Coburg is delighted that peace has finally been restored.
Harry

Harry

	Hmph! So %O0968%Xyou're%Y%a001240's%Z the legendary hero, then. That's almost as good as being a prince.
Kendrick
	Maybe I should reconsider %O0968%Xyou%Yhim%Z as my lackey, seeing as %O0968%Xyou're%Yhe's%Z so important.
Maria
	I see. My brother wrote that on the wall of the Crocodilopolis, did he?
Maria
	I know that my brother's soul will be set at rest now that the world is at peace at last. And that's all thanks to you.
Maria
	Thank you, %a000090.
	And thank you, %a001230.
Maria
	I haven't seen or heard from my brother since we said goodbye at the Crocodilopolis, but I know he's alive. Somewhere.
Maria
	That's what I want to believe, anyway.

	Oh! The legendary heroes!
	I... Thank you! Thank all of you!

	Now you've won peace for us all, we'll fight to the bitter end to keep it!

	It is all as the Goddess intended.
*: 
	May you and your family continue to live under Her divine protection.
*: 
	Well, well. The world's at peace at last, is it?
*: 
	That calls for a good slap-up meal then, I'd say, wouldn't you?

	Yay! We don't have to be afraid of monsters

	No one imagined that the two of you would ever be comin' home.

	People have finally started to set up home again here in Whealbrook, just like the old days.
*: 
	It wouldn't have been possible if the world wasn't at peace again. We can't thank you enough.
*: 
	Pankraz and I used to have our fair share of debates, y'know. I knocked him on the head a fair few times too!
*: 
	Turns out he was king of some kingdom or other. Now I'm thinkin' I should've been a bit more polite!
*: 
	Aah, there'll be a good harvest this year,
	so there will!
