	I wonder what we're supposed to do with this orb. We've brought it here to Zenithia, but now what?
%0%a001250
	It's a relief to have made it here to Zenithia.
Sancho
	You no wonder where ees señor Agon?
%0%a001240
	It's a bit nerve-racking moving the castle about
	the place. We'd never be able to afford to pay
	for any damage.
%0%a001250
	I can't help feeling a bit bad about landing the castle on the ground. I mean, Zenithia's supposed to float up above the clouds, after all.
%0%a001240
	This is from the Yggdrasil tree?
	A tiny little sapling like this?
%0%a001250
	It's so tiny and delicate!
	Can I give it some water, Dad?
%0%a001250
	This tiny sapling's done so well in all that water.
	It's a determined little thing.
Sancho
	They esay you can breeng esomeone who has passed away back from the dead weeth the leaf of Yggdrasil.
Sancho
	But thees ees just a sapling. Eet no has esuch estrong power yet, I believe.
Tuppence
	If we can keep this sapling going, we'll have all the Yggdrasil leaves we could possibly need! Now we can fight to the death without having to worry!
%0%a001240
	ⓗThe darkness spreadethⓘ... I think that means
	we'd better hurry, Dad.
%0%a001250
	That poor sapling, confined to such a tiny pot!
%0%a001250
	Once we've defeated Nimzo, we'll have to make
	sure it's moved to a nice big place with lots and
	lots of sunshine!
Sancho
	Sí, ees just the esapling, but ees from the Great World Tree. Eef you no look after eet well, the Goddess, eshe gonna make you pay!
%0%a001240
	A present? We're not supposed to take presents from strangers. But I suppose it's okay if you're here, Dad.
%0%a001240
	I didn't know there were faeries here too. Do you think Zenithians and faeries are all good friends?
%0%a001250
	Is that grass Yggdrasil? Ooh...
Sancho
	Uf! The dew of Yggdrasil, ees a very
	valuable theeng.
%0%a001240
	That's not fair! Why can we only have one lot at
	a time? It'd be much better if we could take loads of it!
%0%a001250
	We'll have to make sure we use the bit of Yggdrasil dew we have carefully then, Dad.
Sancho
	Sí. Ees true. Eef you have too much of esometheeng like thees, you forget the true value of life.
Tuppence
	You'd think she could just slip us a few extra lots out of goodwill, wouldn't you? We are fighting for world peace, after all.
%0%a001240
	We would never have made it inside the tower without that grappling hook.
%0%a001240
	It's a good job we found that in his cupboard, rather than just a load of old man's pants!
%0%a001250
	I wonder why the old man had that grappling hook in the first place.
%0%a001250
	You don't think he used to be a burglar, do you?
%0%a001240
	Centuries? Wow! I didn't realise this place
	was so old.
%0%a001250
	Have you ever met the Zenith Dragon, Dad?
	I've only ever seen pictures of him in books.
Sancho
	Then we must find thees Zenith Dragon, sí?
Tuppence
	Are humans really all that noble? I'd say gods have the edge there, myself.
%0%a001240
	Zenithia is certainly a fairly tricky place to find your way around!
%0%a001240
	Can the castle still only fly low to the ground?
	I want to see it float right up to the heavens!
%0%a001250
	It looks like things have dried out nicely. The castle has a much happier feel to it now.
%0%a001250
	Zenithia used to be much, much higher all those
	years ago, didn't it? We're lucky we didn't have to climb so high.
Sancho
	Eso, thees ees how the eenside of Zenithia looks?
	Ees very interesting, no? Eef we had more time, I like to look around...
Tuppence
	I'll be able to hold my head up high when we get back to Gotha, so I will! There's not many folk who can say they've been to Zenithia.
%0%a001240
	What a long ladder!
	And it's really dark too...
%0%a001250
	I'm okay. As long as I don't look down, I'm okay.
%0%a001240
	That all sounds a bit odd.
	What do you suppose has been going on?
Sancho
	Ees very estrange, sí?
%0%a001240
	But Dad! Dr Agon's not evil!
	We have to do something to help him.
Sancho
	We can no just ignore thees, eh?
	You must do esometheeng, My Majesty.
%0%a001250
	Yikes. It's scary seeing a Zenithian get angry
	like that!
Tuppence
	Hmph! Well, well, well...
	What a turn-up for the books!
Tuppence
	Well, %a000090, you know you can count on me to help you put this Dr Agon in his place if he isn't what he seems.
%0%a001240
	Dr Agon isn't a bad man, Dad!
	I just know he isn't.
%0%a001250
	I feel so nervous! I wonder what would happen if we gave him the orb.
Sancho
	You never know what ees gonna happen, eh?
	I no like thees...
%0%a001240
	Wow!
%0%a001240
	Th-That was a surprise!
	I didn't see that coming, did you, Dad?
%0%a001250
	The Zenith Dragon... So Dr Agon was the
	Zenith Dragon all along!
Sancho
	When you travel, many, many theengs, they surprise you. But thees...?
	No, I no believe thees.
Sancho
	Ees, ees... Eet hits you like the armada!
Tuppence
	To think that Dr Agon was actually the
	Zenith Dragon...
Tuppence
	Forgive me, o Great One, for my ignorance!
%0%a001240
	I quite liked his human form, actually.
%0%a001240
	But it is good to see him back to his true self.
	I mean, he's pretty cool!
%0%a001250
	Is that really the Zenith Dragon in the flesh?
	This is like living a dream.
Sancho
	To have the Zenith Dragon esay gracias to you, ees, ees...
Tuppence
	Yes, well. He was rather powerless.
Tuppence
	Oops! Not that I mean any offence, of course!
Bianca
	So the Zenith Dragon was masqueradin' as a bumblin' middle-aged man?
Bianca
	What I'd give to have bin able to see that!
Nera
	The great Zenith Dragon...
	I'm quite overwhelmed.
%0%a001240
	Well, it can't be helped. There's no way any of us could've known his true identity.
Sancho
	But ees because he was trying to protect Zenithia, sí? Thees ees why he doubted señor Agon. Ees notheeng to be ashamed.
Tuppence
	I also feel great shame for my faithlessness.
%0%a001240
	It's a relief to know that the Zenith Dragon is back on form again. I feel much more confident about everything now.
Sancho
	We no need to worry about Zenithia no more, eh?
%0%a001240
	I suppose he's right. We still have a battle to win. We'd better get to it, then!
%0%a001250
	That old man can't know much about what's going on in the outside world, being holed up here all the time.
%0%a001250
	It's good that we passed on the news about the Zenith Dragon.
%0%a001240
	Dr Agon didn't exactly have to do all that much, though, did he?
%0%a001240
	Oh well. It's hardly worth going into that now.
%0%a001240
	The Zenith Dragon's really amazing. Do you think he can fly even higher than the castle?
Bianca
	I never imagined for one minute that I'd ever have the chance to visit Zenithia.
Bianca
	I can't help feelin' a bit out of sorts. Maybe it's my Zenithian blood at work.
Nera
	So this is the home of my ancestors...
	But I belong with you now, in Gotha.
Nera
	Being here makes me feel relaxed and on edge all at the same time!
Nera
	I can't really explain it, but something in my heart just won't settle.
%0%a001240
	Zenithia is certainly a fairly tricky place to find your way around!
%0%a001240
	Can the castle still only fly low to the ground?
	I want to see it float right up to the heavens!
%0%a001250
	It looks like things have dried out nicely. The castle has a much happier feel to it now.
%0%a001250
	Zenithia used to be much, much higher all those
	years ago, didn't it? We're lucky we didn't have to climb so high.
Sancho
	You know, when you look again, ees a
	very beautiful castle, sí? You feel eso much history.
Tuppence
	I'll certainly have a story to tell back in Gotha! Imagine people's reactions when they hear I was responsible for the Zenith Dragon's resurrection!
Debora
	So Zenithia really does exist after all.
	I still can't believe a castle like this can fly,
	even after seeing it with my own eyes.
Debora
	I don't know why, but being here makes me feel
	all stirred up somehow. I can't put it into words
	very well.
