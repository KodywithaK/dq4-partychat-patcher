Bianca
	Blimey, this place brings back a few memories, eh? This is where old Briscoletti give us the boat.
Bianca
	The first time we come here was just after we got married, eh? And now here we are again today.
Bianca
	I wonder what kind of situation we'll be in next time we're here.
Nera
	Oh, how funny it is to be here again! We were here just after we were married, remember?
Nera
	It's from here that we set sail out into
	the big, wide ocean.
%0%a001240
	Hey! You can really smell the sea from here!
%0%a001240
	Gotha isn't all that far from the ocean, but this place is practically right on top of it!
%0%a001240
	(yawn) The noise of the waves is starting to make me feel sleepy.
%0%a001250
	The breeze here feels so refreshing. You can hear it come swooshing in over the waves.
%0%a001250
	It's such a nice day again today. I love sunshine.
Sancho
	Eh! Ees a long time esince I am een thees town.
Sancho
	We came here when we were travelling to find you, My Majesty. But we left empty-handed. Eet was eso esad a time.
Tuppence
	Ooh! So you came here on your honeymoon,
	did you, %a000090?
Tuppence
	How lovely! You can't beat a honeymoon by the sea. Maybe I'll meet my special someone here!
Bianca
	This place really feels like it's part of the ocean.
Bianca
	Fancy bein' able to fish when you're in town!
Nera
	The smell of the sea water is really strong.
	Just like before.
Tuppence
	A port town... I imagine there are lots of pretty young fillies here!
Bianca
	Hmm... A monster the size of a mountain?
	Sounds like a bit of a tall tale to me.
Nera
	A monster the size of a mountain... Where have I heard something like that before?
%0%a001250
	If we had a key like that, we could probably travel almost anywhere we wanted!
%0%a001250
	I wonder if it's still inside that monster's belly.
Sancho
	For me, I worry about what would happen eef esuch a key would fall eento the wrong hands. Ees gonna be a beeg problem, eh?
Tuppence
	With a key like that, maybe I could unlock the hearts of women the world over!
Tuppence
	...Er, maybe that was rather crude of me. It doesn't do to be greedy, after all.
Bianca
	That poor old man. I hope that dun't mean he's all on his own now.
Nera
	People say there's nothing worse for a parent than outliving a child.
Nera
	It's hard to find the right words to console
	that poor old man.
%0%a001240
	What a shame for the old man!
%0%a001250
	That poor old man!
Sancho
	I hope thees old man, he gonna find een esometheeng another reason to leeve. Ees eso esad for heem.
Sancho
	For me, my esoul was esaved because I can raise %a001240 and %a001250.
Tuppence
	It's like time has stood still for that old man ever since his son died.
Tuppence
	Every day he's just there moping around and
	doing nothing. His son would be really upset
	if he could see him now.
Bianca
	Any idea what that bloke was on about?
	It all went right over my head!
Nera
	Did you understand what that man was talking about? I'm afraid I had no idea!
%0%a001250
	He didn't even tell us what he was on about,
	and now he thinks whatever it is is true! 
Sancho
	You must listen to what people esay, my friend.
	Ees very important.
Tuppence
	Did you understand what that was all about, %a000090? Goodness! You're much brighter than I am, then.
%0%a001240
	Mt Azimuth is the highest mountain in the world.
	Did you know that, Dad?
Sancho
	Thees Mt Azimuth, ees a very high mountain.
	How ees possible they are building there esuch
	a temple?
Bianca
	He's a brave one! Talkin' to people like that really gets you all buoyed up!
Nera
	Maybe we should join forces with him and fight together. It's a bit tricky trying to explain what we're up to, though.
%0%a001240
	We'd better hurry, Dad! Otherwise he'll get to Grandmaster Nimzo first and defeat him before
	we have the chance!
%0%a001250
	What would happen if he succeeded and really did destroy the world? How scary!
Tuppence
	Anyone can say things like that!
Tuppence
	It's the folk who actually put their money where their mouth is and act on it who are the real heroes. Like me, for instance!
Bianca
	When I look at the monsters you've managed to befriend, %a000090, I find it hard to believe that all of them can be bad.
Nera
	I suppose it can't be helped. The Dragon God probably needs his rest just like we do.
Sancho
	Ees true. We all estruggling here to protect the world. Thees Dragon God, he eshould be helping us.
Bianca
	It looks like they get their fair share of church donations here, eh?
Nera
	I wouldn't be surprised if lots of people don't even realise there's a bank here.
%0%a001240
	Wow! It's amazing that you managed to find a bank in a place like this!
%0%a001240
	Sancho had no idea it was here, you know.
Bianca
	I know him! He used to study under the man who made us some medicine for my father back when I was little!
Nera
	To think that man once dreamt of being a pharmacist and yet he's ended up a sailor! You never can tell where life will take you.
Sancho
	I feel as eef I know thees señor...
	Who ees he?
Bianca
	It's a bit damp down here, en't it? Maybe the monsters prefer it that way.
Nera
	The monsters here are very well-looked-after. They certainly seem happy and healthy enough.
%0%a001240
	Why are these monstergartens always underground? Maybe Monty doesn't like sunshine. 
%0%a001250
	Yay! It's Monty the monster monitor! I really like him!
%0%a001250
	I mean, how could you not like a man who's
	so nice to monsters!?
Sancho
	Thees señor, he ees here to look after the monsters for us, friend.
Sancho
	Maybe we should cook for heem a paella next time, eh?
Bianca
	There's all sorts of treasure around the world, but I'm your prized one, right, %a000090?
Bianca
	Ha ha ha! Thanks!
Bianca
	Fine! Then my treasures are %a001240 and %a001250!
Nera
	How nice to be able to realise a dream you've had since childhood.
Nera
	It's so easy to lose your ambitions or allow them to be changed along the way.
%0%a001240
	I wonder what my dream is... Bringing peace to the world maybe? Hmm...
%0%a001250
	We've travelled so much that we have
	lots of treasure!
%0%a001250
	But the greatest one of all is you, Dad...obviously!
Sancho
	Eet, eet makes me eso happy to esee the young man weeth esuch dreams!
Sancho
	Eet reminds me of the days when I was esuch a man. I, I was also full of dreams.
Tuppence
	My dream is... Hey! Why's no one listening!?
Bianca
	I suppose we can't really expect people to believe a thing like that. I dun't think I believed you until I saw it for myself!
Nera
	If he's lived all his life on the ocean, I suppose it's only natural that he won't believe us.
%0%a001240
	But we're not lying!
%0%a001250
	But we do have a magic carpet!
Bianca
	That's right. And our kids are the cutest of them all, eh, %a000090!?
%0%a001250
	It's good to hear people saying nice things about our monsters, isn't it, Dad?
Tuppence
	I wouldn't say all of them are cute, would you?
	Or maybe you would...
Bianca
	I suppose we shouldn't really expect folk to believe a thing like that.
%0%a001240
	So you know more than he does, Dad! That's cool!
	I hope I end up knowing more than other people
	one day!
%0%a001250
	He he! It's funny that you know the place better than he does.
Bianca
	Ten years ago would've bin around the time we were here together last, eh?
Bianca
	I dun't really remember, but maybe we met those folk that time too.
Nera
	It must be a terrible strain for them, a scholar who's not used to fighting and his wife travelling around like that.
Nera
	I feel so grateful to them for their efforts.
%0%a001240
	Ten years ago? I wasn't even born then.
%0%a001240
	And yet people were looking for me already!
Bianca
	Do you think that man's alright? He seems a bit troubled if you ask me.
Nera
	We must defeat Grandmaster Nimzo at once and set that poor man's mind at ease!
%0%a001240
	Okay, I heard him. I'll do my best.
Tuppence
	Goodness me! What a diligent man he is, being so determined to get his message across!
Bianca
	Oh dear. Bit disappointed, are you, %a000090? Wanted her autograph, did you?
%0%a001240
	What's an autograph?
%0%a001250
	It sounds like hard work being a dancing girl.
Tuppence
	What a pity! I was hoping I might be able to trick her into signing a marriage contract with me.
Bianca
	So the show's only on of a night? I don't remember it bein' that way when I was here before.
Nera
	Those dancing girls are wearing rather skimpy outfits! I hardly know where to look!
%0%a001250
	Their clothes are pretty, but I think I'd be too shy to wear them.
Bianca
	It looks like a tough old job bein' a dancin' girl. I'd hate to have to wear make-up like that.
Nera
	Make-up? Well, I must admit, I, er, do use the tiniest amount every now and then.
%0%a001250
	I just can't seem to get my make-up right
	at all today.
%0%a001250
	Only joking! I just wanted to say it to see what it felt like to be all grown-up.
Tuppence
	What an outfit! Phwoar! Now I'm really glad I came along on this trip!
Bianca
	Blimey! This place is bigger than it looks!
Nera
	I've been here lots of times before with Papa.
%0%a001240
	Wow! This place is huge! And it echoes
	when you speak!
Tuppence
	I should imagine they can fit some fairly large ships in here.
Bianca
	This ship in a bottle is really well-made.
Nera
	The ship inside this bottle looks just like
	Papa's ship.
%0%a001240
	Who did you get that for? Is it for me?
Bianca
	Oh! What a shame we can't afford it!
Nera
	Oh well. We'll just have to come back another time.
%0%a001250
	Didn't you have enough money, Dad? I don't mind not eating today if that helps.
Tuppence
	Don't worry, I won't tell anyone back home that
	His Majesty couldn't afford to shell out a thousand gold coins!
Bianca
	Uh-oh! Looks like that's on its way out to sea!
Nera
	I do feel sorry for the man, but he probably should've been a bit more careful with it if it means that much to him.
%0%a001240
	Oh dear, it's drifted out really far already.
%0%a001250
	I think that man's crying a bit.
Tuppence
	There are some clumsy folk around, aren't there!
Bianca
	M. Bezzler... You can't blame the man for becomin' a thief with a name like that!
Bianca
	Still, I suppose we en't got much room to talk, eh!
Bianca
	Haah, haah...
	Spiral staircases are pretty hard work, eh?
Nera
	This staircase is rather frightening.
	You won't let me fall, will you?
%0%a001240
	I never knew lighthouses were so big on the inside.
%0%a001250
	Do you think these stairs are safe? I'm a bit scared.
Sancho
	Hahh...hahh... Huhh...huhh...
	I must...no eat...eso...much...paella...
	Hahh...hahh...
Bianca
	We sorted that now, so we dun't need to think about it any more.
Bianca
	The main thing is defeatin' Grandmaster Nimzo before it's too late!
Nera
	Even though the Dragon God has been awoken, %a001240's duties are still not done. The poor thing.
%0%a001240
	I wonder if he could see us defeating Korol through the telescope... No, I suppose not.
Bianca
	Wow! The view from here's blimmin' incredible!
Nera
	Don't walk too close to the edge, will you?
	I know the view's nice, but it's a bit too
	scary for me.
%0%a001240
	Woo hoo! I love being up high like this!
%0%a001250
	Um, Dad... Can you hold my hand?
Sancho
	Eh! Look at the beautiful view!
	The nature, ees eso magnificent!
	Eso wonderful! (sob)
Tuppence
	Goodness! Aren't we high up!
Bianca
	Ugh! Some people are just awful. Let's keep our distance from that one, %a000090.
%0%a001240
	I don't get it, what is it he wants to see so badly?
Tuppence
	Ooh! Is there something to see?
Tuppence
	Huh! You can't see a thing!
Bianca
	Dark already, eh?
	Shall we stay the night here?
Nera
	I can't believe it's night already! Time flies so quickly when I'm with you. 
%0%a001240
	Hey! You can really smell the sea from here!
%0%a001240
	Gotha isn't all that far from the ocean, but this place is practically right on top of it!
%0%a001240
	(yawn) The noise of the waves is starting to make me feel sleepy.
%0%a001250
	The breeze here feels so refreshing. You can hear it come swooshing in over the waves.
%0%a001250
	Ooh, look at the stars! Aren't they pretty?
Sancho
	Eh! Ees a long time esince I am een thees town.
Sancho
	We came here when we were travelling to find you, My Majesty. But we left empty-handed. Eet was eso esad a time.
Tuppence
	Ooh! So you came here on your honeymoon,
	did you, %a000090?
Tuppence
	How lovely! You can't beat a honeymoon by the sea. Maybe I'll meet my special someone here!
Bianca
	Pretty impressive. He's still keepin' up the chatter even though he's sloshed.
Nera
	Oh dear! Do you think that man's alright?
	He seems to have drunk rather a bit too much.
%0%a001250
	Urgh! He smells of drink.
Bianca
	So it's not just on land. The monsters in the sea are gettin' more vicious too. Things are goin' from bad to worse.
Nera
	I'd better try to make myself a bit stronger so that I don't end up being a hindrance to you.
%0%a001240
	We're always taking our lives in our hands!
	Every day!
Tuppence
	What a brave man, risking the only life he has
	like that.
Bianca
	That poor old man. I feel really sorry for him.
Nera
	I know the poor man must be feeling terribly desperate, but he really shouldn't be sleeping in a place like this. He'll catch his death of cold.
%0%a001250
	That poor old man!
Sancho
	............
Sancho
	Thees poor man, he, he ees remembering esometheeng terrible from hees past. To esee the people esuffering... Eet tugs at my heart... (sniff)
Bianca
	We must make the world peaceful again as soon as we possibly can.
Bianca
	It's horrible to see so many people scarred by what's happened. We dun't want that to get any worse.
Nera
	If we ever see a flame like that, we should go and help. I can't bear to see people so upset.
%0%a001240
	Huh, I can't see anything.
	Does that mean it's all safe today?
%0%a001250
	I can hear it... The sound of sad crying...
	Or maybe it's singing...
Bianca
	Um, %a000090... Do you understand how that man feels at all...?
Nera
	I hope you feel like that about seeing my sleeping face! I'll try to be a good wife so that you do.
Nera
	Ah-phew, ah-phew...
Nera
	Is that how I look?
%0%a001240
	That's what happened to me! When I saw that statue of you, it made me forget my exhaustion too! 
%0%a001250
	Zzzz...
Sancho
	Ah, the love of the man for hees wife!
	Ees eso moving.
Tuppence
	I think I usually feel even more exhausted when I go home and see Mother's face. I wonder why.
%0%a001250
	Ah-phew, ah-phew...
Bianca
	It's a tough old life being a parent.
Bianca
	Not that there's any point standin' here worryin' about it. We need to be proactive and sort things out.
Nera
	She's right, life really is the greatest treasure of all.
Nera
	But we can't very well say something like that to %a001240. It's very hard.
Sancho
	The Goddess, eshe no bless me weeth the
	children, but estill, I understand thees señora very well.
Sancho
	My Majesty. Promise me you gonna have the long and happy life, eh.
Bianca
	Looks like someone fancies a treasure hunt!
	I was always dreamin' of adventures and treasure when I was his age.
%0%a001240
	Wow! A treasure map! I want to see it!
	...Oh, but I suppose he's just dreaming.
Bianca
	What exactly is his career? Spectatin'?
	That en't much of a career!
%0%a001240
	Fifteen years! I haven't even been alive that long!
%0%a001250
	I'm sleepy...
Bianca
	That bloke's really creepy. I dun't much like seein' men act like that.
Nera
	I could never dance or dress like that.
	I'd be too embarrassed!
%0%a001240
	She's really pretty. Almost like a flower!
Tuppence
	Lyn Gerie...
	Ohhh...
Bianca
	Do you reckon the girl in the middle's pretty too, %a000090?
Bianca
	Hmph!
Bianca
	Good!
Nera
	The girl in the middle certainly is the most striking. I can see why she's so popular.
%0%a001240
	Eight times!? Now that's dedication!
%0%a001250
	That could get really annoying.
Bianca
	Do you think he was talkin' about Pankraz?
Bianca
	I'm pretty sure he must've bin. He really was a brave man. A hero.
Nera
	The last time we met that old man, I'm sure he remembered Pankraz's name correctly.
Nera
	Time must have really moved on for him to forget something so important.
%0%a001240
	How rude! My name isn't Pancakes!
	It's %a001240!
%0%a001250
	Hm? Is it night already? Then it's almost time for bed. (yawn)
Sancho
	Uf! Thees old man, hees memory ees mushy like the avocado. But me, I remember like eet was yesterday!
Sancho
	Señor Pankraz, he esaved thees old man from the monsters. He was eso brave and wonderful capitán!
Sancho
	After thees, the old man esay that señor Pankraz, he ees the legendary hero, no? Thees ees how he remembers heem.
Tuppence
	He doesn't really seem to know what he's talking about. Do you think he's all there?
%0%a001240
	Of course we won't give up! We found you, Dad, so we can find Mum too!
Bianca
	So that fella makes ships in bottles? He dun't seem the type somehow.
Nera
	He wouldn't be able to sell so many of them
	if they weren't of a decent quality. He must
	be very skilled.
Sancho
	Ees for the best that he no go to thees White King's Paradise, no?
Bianca
	Let's go over there. We don't want to hang around here too long otherwise people'll start to think we're with him.
Nera
	How bizarre! Men can be ever so funny sometimes.
Sancho
	Okay, friend! Ees time for bed!
	Rápido, eh? Rápido!
Sancho
	Ees notheeng to worry about. I going esleep too. You no wake up and find me no here. I no be een the pub. No, no, friend! No!
Tuppence
	Fair enough. You are married, after all, %a000090.
Tuppence
	I, on the other hand, am not! If they need a seventh ⓗblokeⓘ, I'm their man!
Bianca
	Well, looks like we've started.
Bianca
	Started what? One day of me not talkin' to you,
	that's what!
Nera
	Huh! It's not always appropriate to joke around like that, you know!
~ Nera seems to be quite angry. ~
Sancho
	Now you are a man, eh, friend? But you are also a king. Maybe ees no eso good for you to behave like thees.
Tuppence
	We'd better hurry up and find somewhere before all the good spots are taken by other people!
Bianca
	Urgh. That man looks like a really dirty piece
	of work.
Nera
	I don't think I've ever seen anyone with quite that expression on their face before.
%0%a001240
	That man's a grown-up, but he was
	dribbling when he spoke!
Bianca
	Our journey can be a bit of a bind at times, but it dun't look like dancin' girls have it easy neither.
Nera
	I wonder how Cleo is.
%0%a001240
	Do you know this Cleo person, Dad? Hmm...
Tuppence
	Lyn Gerie is positively glowing!
Tuppence
	I don't know where to look with all these beautiful dancing girls everywhere!
Bianca
	Hey! What d'you think you're doin'? You think it's alright to go bargin' in on people like that, do you?
Bianca
	Pah! Pankraz must be cryin' tears of disappointment if he's lookin' down on you
	now from heaven!
Bianca
	Right answer.
	So let's go.
Nera
	I've made up my mind!
Nera
	I'm going to give you a nasty surprise one of these days and see how you like it!
%0%a001240
	A bath would be nice. I wouldn't mind one too.
Tuppence
	I don't think you made yourself very popular there, %a000090!
Bianca
	It's pretty here at night with the moonlight shinin' in.
Nera
	It's so pretty here with the moonlight shining in.
%0%a001250
	I can see the moon and the stars through
	the window.
Bianca
	En't this bloke supposed to be the one takin'
	care of the lighthouse? I wonder if the flame's still goin'.
Nera
	Surely night-time is when the lighthouse flame is most needed. Maybe we should wake him up.
%0%a001240
	That's a serious snore he's got on him there!
Bianca
	Hey! Maybe it's the cat who's keepin' watch over the lighthouse! Ha ha ha!
Nera
	Perhaps it's the cat's turn to tend to the flame at night. Cats can be quite clever, you know.
%0%a001250
	What a sweet cat! If the flame goes out, it's going to wake the man up.
Bianca
	This is amazin'! I feel like I could reach out and touch the stars!
Nera
	Don't walk too close to the edge, will you?
	I know the view's lovely at night, but it's
	a bit too scary for me.
%0%a001240
	The sea's so dark at night. It's a little bit spooky.
%0%a001250
	Wow! Look how close we are to the sky!
	Look at all those stars!
Sancho
	Look at the lights from the buildings. They are eso... They are eso pretty! Eet breengs the tear to my eye!
Debora
	This is where we first set sail from all those years ago, isn't it?
Debora
	I'm still as beautiful as I ever was, but you've aged a bit, haven't you?
Debora
	Don't think that means I'll go easy on you.
	Consider yourself still at my beck and call!
Debora
	Hmm, I suppose you'd have aged much more if you hadn't been a statue for all those years.
Debora
	This place is just the same as it was years ago, even down to the smell of the sea air.
Debora
	It'll probably be just the same when we next come too. If not for all eternity!
Debora
	Hurry up and find us an inn, will you?
	I want a bath.
Debora
	A monster the size of a mountain...
	I'm sure I heard something like that before, but I can't quite remember where...
Debora
	We should leave him to his thoughts.
	That's about all we can do for him.
Tuppence
	Ooh! I didn't realise you were such a softie at heart, Miss Debora!
Debora
	What's that supposed to mean?
	Come on, spit it out!
Tuppence
	Um, er, n-nothing.
	I didn't mean a thing!
Debora
	You shouldn't just answer questions like that without thinking, %a000090.
Debora
	What if it's a lie? Don't come crying to me if someone makes a fool of you.
Debora
	Do you think he'd really take our place and go
	to Nadiria to fight Nimzo? It's a lot easier said
	than done.
Debora
	If the Dragon God's been taking a break for a while, then it's about time he sprung into action and helped out a little bit.
Debora
	I've no interest in money. I can always get some from Papa if I ask for it, and now I have another purse that goes by the name of %a000090 too!
Tuppence
	Do you know this man, %a000090?
	You have such a wide circle of friends!
Debora
	Life takes some funny turns. There I was thinking I'd got myself a servant, and it turns out he's a prince!
Debora
	I must be a woman of greater foresight than I give myself credit for.
Tuppence
	I think there's a monstergarten in the pub in
	Gotha too.
Debora
	If you're done here, let's go outside.
	I don't like dark, cramped places like this.
Debora
	You have so much treasure already ⓚⓛ me and %a001240 and %a001250. The only one left is...well, it's obvious.
Debora
	Oh well. I doubt I would've believed it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.
Debora
	They are quite sweet. It's nice to have plenty of servants who hang on your every word.
Nera
	I don't blame him. I never would've believed anyone would travel with monsters, much less that I'd ever do it myself!
Debora
	Travelling with monsters isn't that bad, though, is it? They don't talk back as much as humans, for
	one thing.
Debora
	I think I remember seeing those two when we were here on our honeymoon all those years ago.
Debora
	Back then, the hero and Grandmaster Nimzo were just the stuff of legend as far as I was concerned. I never saw this coming!
Debora
	Foolish man, trying to do more than he's capable of! You'd think a scholar like him would behave a bit
	more intelligently.
Debora
	He won't be able to go any further now. He needs to rest. You'll take care of Nimzo anyway, won't you, %a000090?
Debora
	So the show's still only on at night. If you want to come and watch it, %a000090, I'll gladly come with you.
Debora
	I never have trouble with my make-up.
Debora
	And I make sure to go to bed early every night.
	I actually make quite an effort to keep myself looking beautiful, you know.
Debora
	Papa brought me here lots of times.
Debora
	This ship in a bottle isn't bad. I wonder what Papa would say if I bought one for him.
Debora
	How embarrassing, not even being able to afford a measly one thousand gold coins! Don't you dare show me up like that again, %a000090.
Debora
	What a klutz! I find people like that so irritating.
Tuppence
	These stairs are nothing!
	I could run up them if I wanted to!
	Um...are we nearly there yet?
Debora
	How much longer do these stairs go on?
	My feet are killing me!
Debora
	You already took care of everyone at the Crocodilopolis. Now it's just Nimzo we have to
	finish off.
Debora
	The view's not bad. It would be a lot better if we hadn't had to climb all those stairs to get to it.
Nera
	What do you suppose it is he's trying to look at?
Nera
	S-Surely not? How embarrassing!
	I can't understand that at all!
Debora
	Fancy going to all this effort just to sneak a peek at someone. What a waste of space!
Debora
	We're leaving, %a000090. Come on, %a001240. You too, %a001250. We don't want to be tarred with the same brush as this oaf.
%0%a001240 & %0%a001250
	Coming, Mum!
	Okay, Mum!
Debora
	Time's getting on, so you'd better hurry up and find us a room. Staying up late is bad for the complexion.
Debora
	Yuck! He reeks of drink. You'll never get yourself into a state like that if you value your life, %a000090!
Debora
	Yes, you should make yourself stronger, %a000090. We don't want you dragging me and the kids down.
Debora
	Can't he do his crying in private? Besides anything else, he's old and he could catch his death out here.
Debora
	We need to hurry up and bring peace to the world. I'm starting to get tired of all this travelling.
Debora
	I don't tend to feel tired when you're
	around, actually.
Debora
	That's probably because I make you take care of all the hard work, though!
Debora
	I've always thought parents tend to go on a bit.
Debora
	I still think it now, even though I'm a mum.
	Mama and Papa definitely worry too much.
Debora
	That's why Papa's so bald, you know. You'll have to watch out for that. Our kids are fine, so don't worry about them.
Debora
	That reminds me of how Nera used to bury her things and draw treasure maps when she was little.
Debora
	Did I do the same? No, but I had a whale of a time digging up her stash! Ha!
Debora
	Naturally, Crispin was always the one who dug it up. I wouldn't want to break a nail or anything.
Nera
	He's been coming here every day for fifteen years? What a dedicated man!
Debora
	He's been coming here every day for fifteen years? He must have plenty of time on his hands, the lucky thing.
Debora
	I suppose she's quite pretty.
	Still not a patch on me, though.
Debora
	I suppose the one in the middle is the prettiest.
	She's still not a patch on me, though.
Debora
	I'm sure this old man was much more together when we saw him all those years ago.
Debora
	The passing of time can be very cruel.
Tuppence
	They say a man is the sum of his achievements, and they're right. I must try harder!
Debora
	So he escaped being roped in with the Order of Zugzwang because these ships in bottles made
	him rich.
Debora
	It just goes to show how having a skill can get you somewhere in life. I have you, though, so I don't need to bother with anything like that.
Debora
	I suppose you think that's funny, do you, %a000090?
~ Debora seems rather angry. ~
Debora
	Men like him really are a waste of space.
Debora
	I wonder how Cleo is getting along back in
	her hometown.
Debora
	What are you thinking of, charging into private rooms as if you owned the place?
Debora
	Well, I shouldn't be surprised to see you being so thoughtless. You never think of anyone but yourself!
Debora
	What a lovely bright moon! All the better for you to enjoy my beauty by the light of, %a000090!
%0%a001250
	I'm feeling...a bit...sleepy too...
Debora
	Um... If he sleeps at night, then he's not much of a lighthouse keeper, is he? What a useless creature!
Debora
	Is the cat acting as lighthouse keeper?
	...Surely not!
Debora
	The stars are lovely, aren't they? I'm very drawn to pretty things. I suppose like attracts like.
Nera
	I used to draw treasure maps when I was his age. I'd even go so far as to bury the treasure myself. He he!
Nera
	But it was really very strange. I'd always end up finding the treasure mysteriously back inside my cupboard.
Nera
	Debora always said it was the faeries up to their tricks, but now I come to think of it, it was
	probably her!
%0%a001240
	What is it that you can see? I want to have a look!
Debora
	ⓗI wantⓘ doesn't get. We're leaving.
	Understood?
%0%a001240
	...Yes, Mum.
%0%a001240
	What is it that you can see? I want to have a look!
Debora
	ⓗI wantⓘ doesn't get. We're leaving.
	Understood?
%0%a001240
	...Yes, Mum.
Tuppence
	What a pity there are no beauties to be seen from here! I thought it would be a prime spot.
Debora
	Excuse me, Tuppence, but are you blind?
	Or are you daring to say that I'm not beautiful?
Tuppence
	Um, er, I, er... My dear Queen D-Debora...
	There's not a s-star in the sky more beautiful
	than you!
Debora
	You know, Tuppence, I've noticed lately that you tend to stutter a lot when you're being honest.
