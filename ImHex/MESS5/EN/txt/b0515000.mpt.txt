%0%a001240
	Yay! It's a slurpodrome! I bet I can pick a winner. Now, let's see...
%0%a001250
	He he! Look at all those funny-coloured slimes!
Sancho
	The slimes, they are eso cute, no?
	Ees because they have the h-healthy paunch, djou know. I n-no think of them as monsters.
Tuppence
	Slime races just don't seem exciting enough.
	I can't quite get into the gambling frame of mind
	with them somehow.
Bianca
	Ha ha ha! Looks like the old bloke's havin' fun!
Nera
	He's looking at those slimes with so much
	affection. It's almost as if he thinks of them
	as his grandchildren!
%0%a001240
	It's funny when the slimes fall splat on their faces!
%0%a001250
	I can't figure it out either. These slimes are all quite unpredictable.
Bianca
	Slimes are so bouncy and cute-looking.
Bianca
	But when you touch them, they're so...slimy! Yuck!
Nera
	The slimes here have such bright, shining eyes.
%0%a001250
	That slime smells of strawberries!
Tuppence
	I say! These slimes are roaming free.
	Do you suppose that's safe?
Bianca
	Yeah, but still, you never can tell what'll happen at the slurpodrome.
%0%a001240
	That one certainly seems to look down its nose at
	the others, doesn't it? Assuming slimes have noses, that is.
%0%a001250
	That slime smells of fresh leaves.
Sancho
	Djou wanna b-bet on the green slime, My M-Majesty?
	Hmm...
Bianca
	It'd be fun if we could get a talkin' slime in
	our party, eh? Unless they'd be too much of
	a chatterbox.
Nera
	Slimes are so childish and silly. Er... I mean childlike and innocent.
%0%a001250
	Urgh! That slime smells of curry!
Bianca
	We used to play T 'n' T together when we were kids. You always won, mind.
Nera
	I always marvel at who thought up the idea of such gigantic T 'n' T boards.
%0%a001240
	Yay! It's Treasures and Trapdoors!
%0%a001250
	I really like T 'n' T. I always manage to beat %a001240.
Sancho
	Hmm... Ees n-no eso beeg, thees board, eh?
Tuppence
	Ooh! If you're planning on a game of T 'n' T, you must let me do the honours! You won't be sorry, I promise.
Bianca
	If only you could always roll what you wanted, eh? I s'pose that'd get a bit borin', though.
Nera
	Oh dear. He's taking it all rather seriously.
	You men can be so funny at times.
%0%a001250
	I've already figured out the best way around. Pretty clever, don't you think, Dad?
Sancho
	Thees ees a g-good idea! First djou look at
	the board from the floor, then djou t-t-take the
	ch-challenge, si?
Tuppence
	A real man shouldn't dilly-dally! No, he should make up his mind and be done with it.
Bianca
	Huh! Let's give it another go, %a000090!
Nera
	I didn't expect anyone to be down there! I hope he couldn't see up my skirt...
%0%a001240
	Ha ha ha! It's quite fun falling off, too!
Tuppence
	You don't think he's hanging around there just so he can laugh at people, do you?
Tuppence
	Honestly! Some people!
Bianca
	What a mean old man. We'll have to make sure we don't fall off the board if we decide to have a game.
Nera
	The poor man. It must be frustrating not to have ever succeeded.
Sancho
	Ees n-no eso fun to watch the others l-losing, djou know. Ees a shame for thees señor.
Tuppence
	That does sound like it could be rather funny. If I had time to hang around, I wouldn't mind seeing someone fall.
Bianca
	This place is pretty lively of a night, too, eh?
Bianca
	There didn't used to be a bridge in the past, so you couldn't get here from Roundbeck and Whealbrook.
Nera
	I never visited here at night during my time at the abbey. It's quite a revelation.
Nera
	Naturally, I didn't go to the casino during my
	days at the abbey. But Papa took me there lots
	of times before.
%0%a001240
	This place is pretty lively! I'm feeling all impatient now. I just want to explore and have fun!
%0%a001240
	When we came here before with Sancho, I watched a race at the slurpodrome.
%0%a001240
	Have you ever seen one, Dad?
	They're really good fun!
%0%a001250
	This town is so big, I'm sure I'd get lost in it in an instant. Don't let go of my hand, will you, Dad?
%0%a001250
	............Zzz.
%0%a001250
	......Hm? Did you say something?
	Yes, yes! I'm awake......
Sancho
	Uf... Ees eso m-many walls een thees town.
	Djou n-no feel trapped? I, I can n-no breathe
	eso well...
Sancho
	Even eenside Gotha Castle eet f-feels more open than thees. Djou no think eso, chico?
Sancho
	Ees the night, b-b-but ees eso bright, eet feels l-like the day!
Tuppence
	So this is the famous Fortuna!
Tuppence
	I know, %a000090! Why don't we all split up for a while and have a bit of fun? ...No? Oh, what a shame!
Tuppence
	I'm afraid I'm not very proficient when it comes
	to the casino. I do enjoy a visit every once in a
	while, though.
Tuppence
	I tend to lose, so it's especially exciting for me when I do manage a win.
Bianca
	This place never sleeps, eh?
Nera
	If only everyone here was having fun. I'm afraid they have their fair share of desolate souls here, too, though.
%0%a001240
	We don't have much time to enjoy the place, though, do we?
Sancho
	Ees t-too much t-t-temptation here.
	Djou must n-no let djourself become weak.
	Ees t-time to estay een the inn for tonight.
Tuppence
	If only I could forget my duties for a while and really let my hair down...
Bianca
	Maybe we should have a bit of a flutter, eh?
Nera
	It's upsetting to see people down in the dumps like that. The point of a casino is to have fun, after all.
%0%a001240
	There's not much point in him telling us, is there? There's nothing we can do about it.
%0%a001250
	Urgh! That man smelt like he'd had a whole barrel of drink to himself!
Tuppence
	It's no use crying over spilt milk. The important thing in this game is knowing when to call it a day.
Bianca
	He seems really sad. I wonder what happened to him.
Nera
	It might be best if we gave him some space.
%0%a001240
	The lights here at night are really pretty.
%0%a001250
	I really like stars, so I suppose that must mean I like night-time. I always get really sleepy, though.
Sancho
	Si, ees true. Ees especially true on the
	qu-quiet nights. Then djou th-think of eso
	many, many memories.
Tuppence
	I'm not overly fond of the night-time myself. There always tend to be more monsters out on the prowl.
%0%a001240
	Does that mean I'm not the man of her liking? Oh! ...Actually, I'm sort of relieved.
%0%a001250
	I don't particularly want to hear my
	fortune anyway.
Sancho
	Esometimes the drowning man, he clutches at the straws. Maybe ees n-no esuch a bad idea to listen to the fortune-teller esometimes, too.
%0%a001240
	Yikes! Her face goes all scary when she tells
	your fortune!
%0%a001250
	Maybe I should become a fortune-teller when I
	grow up.
Tuppence
	It's rather fortunate that she'd give us a reading for free, isn't it, %a000090?
	...Ha ha! Fortunate! I'm an accidental comedian!
%0%a001240
	Don't you want her to tell our fortune?
	I was looking forward to that.
Tuppence
	Yes, fortune-telling can be a bit hit and miss. Maybe it's not worth paying any attention to it all.
Bianca
	I'm sure that won't stop you, eh? You just have to poke your nose in everywhere, dun't you?
Nera
	Hmph! Do I look like the type to go spying on someone while they're having a bath!?
%0%a001250
	I quite fancy having a bath now.
Tuppence
	How rude! As if I'd barge in on a man having a bath!
Bianca
	What a cheek! Did he think we were comin' here to try and take a peek or somethin'!?
Nera
	If anyone's in the wrong, it's him for not having a door on his bathroom!
Sancho
	Thees señor and señora, they always think of each other, no? Si, there ees n-nothing to esee here.
	Ees t-time for us to leave.
Tuppence
	We'll have to time things more appropriately next time, %a000090.
Bianca
	We would've probably felt the same under normal circumstances, but it's a bit different when one of your kids is the legendary hero, eh?
Nera
	Everyone wants a world without monsters, but it would be a shame if all the nice monsters had to disappear, too.
%0%a001240
	I used to think I didn't get much chance to play, but it doesn't look like most other kids do either.
%0%a001250
	It's fun travelling about together, but I sometimes think how nice it would be if we could all just live normal quiet lives at home.
Bianca
	I dun't much like hearin' other women chattin' you up. I s'pose that's a wife's prerogative, eh?
Nera
	It seems I'm not the only one who finds you so attractive, %a000090!
%0%a001250
	It's funny hearing her talk to you like that.
Tuppence
	Some people just have an eye for it, you see.
	I'm referring to my sex appeal, of course.
Bianca
	And yet he takes another sip, so it can't be all
	that bad!
%0%a001240
	Ooh! I wonder if the landlord watered them down!
Sancho
	The taste of the alcohol, eet depends on djour own mood, djou know.
Sancho
	When djou are happy, eet tastes like the liquid paella. But when djou are esad, ees, ees... (sniff)
Bianca
	Mum and Dad gave me a brilliant childhood.
	They always took good care of me.
Bianca
	With Mum gone, the family got a bit smaller for
	a while. But now you've joined, so we're back up
	to three.
Bianca
	And now we have %a001240 and %a001250. We've got so much to be thankful for, even though times are tough.
Nera
	We were separated for a long time, but I'm truly happy now that we've been reunited.
Nera
	It really is the best thing in the world to have
	a family.
%0%a001240
	There's lots of houses here in this town, isn't there? I'm bound to get lost.
%0%a001250
	I can do anything as long as you're all with me.
Sancho
	Djour Uncle Sancho, he n-no have a family now.
	For me, señor P-Pankraz, he was my family.
	But now he ees n-no lon... No longer... (sob)
Tuppence
	I wonder how Mother is getting along.
Bianca
	He must be a feisty old man to spend every night down the pub like that.
Nera
	I hope that old fellow isn't drinking to excess with all those pub visits.
%0%a001240
	Why do grown-ups all spend so much time at the pub? I don't get it.
Sancho
	The alcohol, ees all p-poison, djou know. When djou are djoung, and when djou are old. Ees n-no good to drink t-t-too much.
Bianca
	It's a pretty normal-lookin' place for a
	fortune-teller's house.
Nera
	I heard talk of the fortune-teller here when I was at the abbey. Apparently, her readings can be a bit hit and miss.
%0%a001250
	Do you think he's waiting up for her to come home? That's nice of him.
Bianca
	How many times do I have to tell you that you shouldn't go tryin' to start conversations with folk while they're sleepin'?
Nera
	You really shouldn't intrude on a woman while she's sleeping, %a000090.
%0%a001240
	What's going on with her ears!?
Tuppence
	Bunny girls are cute even when they're sleeping!
Bianca
	Fancy havin' an underground jail in town! I s'pose there's bound to be crime when you collect so many folk together in one spot, though.
Nera
	Jails always seem to feel so cold.
%0%a001240
	This place is really creepy. I'd rather not come down here if we don't have to.
%0%a001250
	It's dark and cold and smelly down here.
	I don't like it!
Tuppence
	I say! That soldier's asleep! Do you suppose we should wake him?
Bianca
	Um... You sure we should've let him go, %a000090?
Nera
	Oh dear! He's gone!
%0%a001240
	He said something about the stool.
	I wonder what's there.
%0%a001250
	That man was really stinky.
Sancho
	Eesⓚⓛ
	Ees the thug who...
	When señor Harry, he was...!
Bianca
	That's worth knowin', eh?
	We should go and give it a whirl!
Bianca
	Er, I suppose we'd better watch that we dun't end up spendin' too much time gamblin', though.
Nera
	Well! He's certainly in the know.
%0%a001240
	Do you think that's true?
Sancho
	Ees only h-helpful eef they n-no have changed
	the places of the slot machines. But ees
	pr-probably okay.
Bianca
	Eh? Dun't you want it? I was thinkin' it could come in really handy.
Nera
	I wonder what a monster menagerie is. If it's only a thousand gold coins, we could just take a chance and buy it...
%0%a001240
	Ooh! What's a monster menagerie?
%0%a001250
	A monster menagerie... That sounds pretty impressive. I want one!
Bianca
	Nice! Let's go and check it out.
Nera
	I wonder what this monster menagerie is all about. How exciting!
%0%a001240
	Yay! We got it! We got it!
	Um... What is a monster menagerie, anyway?
%0%a001250
	Did you buy the monster menagerie?
	Are there any monsters inside?
Bianca
	Hm, it's pretty tough havin' to buy stuff for all our gang, eh?
Nera
	Oh well. I suppose we'll just have to come back again when we've saved up.
%0%a001250
	Can't you afford it, Dad? You could always sell some of my clothes to get some more money.
Sancho
	I am esorry, chico. My pockets, they are empty.
	I can n-no geeve djou nothing.
Bianca
	He certainly stocks some pretty curious items,
	eh? Seems to be doin' a fairly decent business
	out of it, mind.
Nera
	I can't wait to see what the next weird and wonderful item he has in stock will be!
%0%a001240
	Let's come back here again, Dad!
Sancho
	Thees señor, he ees a g-good businessman, si?
	He ees as esharp as a m-machete!
Bianca
	Yeah, five thousand gold coins seems like a bit of a fortune to spend on a funny old curtain.
Nera
	Oh! Aren't you going to buy it? But it's so sweet!
Nera
	Sorry. If you've made up your mind, then I won't try to change it.
%0%a001240
	Oh! Go on, Dad! Buy it, buy it, buy it!
%0%a001250
	If you don't want to buy it, then I won't try to change your mind.
Sancho
	I n-no eso sure how m-many times we g-gonna need thees s-slime curio when we are tr-travelling...
Bianca
	Did you really want this funny old curtain, %a000090? It dun't much look like your kind
	of thing.
Nera
	Yippee! I'm so happy! This is just what I wanted!
	It's so pretty!
%0%a001240
	Yay! We got it! Thanks, Dad! I'm going to use it as a blanket when I go to bed tonight.
%0%a001250
	It doesn't look all that cute when you get up close.
Sancho
	Qué? Oh, djou can wear thees curio.
	I wonder who ees gonna l-look the best een eet.
Bianca
	Hm, it's pretty tough havin' to buy stuff for all our gang, eh?
Nera
	Oh well. I suppose we'll just have to come back again when we've saved up.
%0%a001250
	Can't you afford it, Dad? You could always sell some of my clothes to get some more money.
Sancho
	I am esorry, chico. My pockets, they are empty.
	I can n-no geeve djou nothing.
Bianca
	Does that mean he's shuttin' up shop? I was lookin' forward to seein' what other weird and wonderful things he might have on sale.
Nera
	I hope he'll start selling his curiosities again once the world is in better shape.
%0%a001240
	Do you think he travels about on his own?
	That would be hard going.
Tuppence
	Yes, I don't think I'd be too keen on travelling about at the moment if I weren't with you, %a000090.
Bianca
	Bein' in a casino is like bein' in another world. It helps you forget your troubles for a little while.
Nera
	Don't forget that a casino is just a place to let off a little steam. You mustn't get too carried away.
%0%a001240
	Dad! Dad! Let's go to the slurpodrome and watch a slime race! I reckon I can pick a winner!
%0%a001250
	Did you see that man before? He was crying.
	Don't you cry, will you, Dad?
Sancho
	Maybe we can ween esomething for our journey. Esomething which ees gonna muchos h-help us.
Sancho
	But djou n-no gamble too much, okay, chico?
	The first rule of the casino ees to t-take eet eslow.
Tuppence
	Rrraargh! The gambler's blood in me is flowing fast and furious again for the first time in a long time!
Tuppence
	...Hm? You look surprised. Did you not know about my penchant for a flutter?
Bianca
	He's right, %a000090. We shouldn't get too carried away.
Nera
	Some people get hooked despite that. Imagine what it would be like if you could actually win money here!
Sancho
	Ees a g-g-good idea, no? Eef the casino, eet n-no return to the clientes their gold, they g-gonna make beeg money!
Sancho
	Maybe ees t-time for a casino een Gotha, no?
	But ees n-no good for the esafety. The crime, ees gonna increase, too. Hmm...
Bianca
	We probably act like that when we get caught up in gamblin'. How embarrassin'!
Nera
	He seems to be a bit over-excited. Maybe he's never had a win before.
%0%a001240
	Go on!
	That's the way!
%0%a001250
	He was a bit carried away for a grown-up.
Sancho
	Djou n-no talk too much, okay, chico?
	Eef djou play here, djou play.
	But eef djou go, djou must go quickly.
Bianca
	Hm, but you can lose a lot of money fast in
	the hundred-token slots, so you really have
	to go careful.
Nera
	Papa only ever played on the hundred token slot machines. It seems rather frivolous when I think
	of it now.
%0%a001240
	Hundred-token slots...
	Maybe I'm not quite ready for them yet.
Tuppence
	The hundred-token slots? Dear me! I do love casinos, but I tend to be a bit too cautious to play with those kind of amounts.
Bianca
	Mum always said that every profession needs its underlings. Without them, the whole thing falls apart.
Nera
	I hope he has his dream come true some day.
%0%a001250
	Aaah. That man had such a nice voice.
	I hope I get to talk to him again...
Bianca
	Urgh! He spat on me!
Nera
	He should stop there and have a rest before he does himself a mischief.
%0%a001240
	Where's the stunning young beauty come to steal a prince's cart? What? She's behind me?
	Oh no she isn't!
%0%a001240
	What do you think?
	Did I get the words right?
Bianca
	Typical old bloke, eh? Thinks he knows all there is to know about life just because his has bin a long one!
Nera
	I suppose there are all sorts of ways to find entertainment in a casino.
%0%a001240
	How come he says you can see all walks of life here? I can't see anything special. I don't get it!
%0%a001250
	I don't really like casinos. They're so noisy.
Bianca
	I en't sure it's the kind of thing he should be bettin' on, but it looks like he's got a winner there, eh?
Sancho
	Ees l-like a game for thees señor, eh?
	Because he doesn't know anything.
	M-Maybe he's lucky...
Bianca
	They all dance so well. It's quite a show!
Nera
	I'm surprised their costumes don't fall down with all that dancing about!
Sancho
	Ees a r-rumba or a salsa? Heh heh! I n-no care.
	But I can no t-take my eyes away from them!
Tuppence
	I think they're absolutely fantastic. Just look at the way they move in those costumes. Mmmm!
%0%a001240
	That guy looked really intense.
%0%a001250
	Urgh! You won't end up looking all scruffy like him, will you, Dad?
Bianca
	I dun't think I know this song specifically, but it somehow sounds familiar.
Nera
	La la la Ⓠ
	Please, baby, ooh,
	I need you! Ⓠ
%0%a001240
	La la la Ⓠ
	Geez, baby poo...!  Ⓠ
%0%a001250
	What a good song!
Tuppence
	Yes, I'd say she's probably the prettiest of them all.
Bianca
	Looks like you think it's pretty raunchy, eh, %a000090? I can tell by that glazed look in
	your eyes!
Nera
	Darling, do you mind if we go elsewhere? I'm not too keen on being here on the stage.
%0%a001240
	What does raunchy mean?
	Does it mean rude?
%0%a001250
	Look at that costume!
	I'd be really embarrassed if I were her.
Sancho
	Perfect papayas! I, I n-no...
	Ah! Si! We n-need to take a rest from all our h-hard travelling, no? Ees a g-good time, eh? Si, si.
Tuppence
	Oh, yes. It's very raunchy.
	Very raunchy indeed!
Bianca
	I en't lettin' her get the better of me!
	Da-da-daa, Da-da-da-daaa...  Ⓠ
Nera
	Stop it, %a000090! It's making me feel funny seeing you watch her tummy button wiggling around like that!
%0%a001240
	Da-da-daa, Da-da-da-daaa...!
	What do you reckon, Dad? Am I any good?
%0%a001250
	Huh. I'm no good at dancing.
Bianca
	Yeah, well, it can't hurt to let go and have a bit of fun every once in a while, eh?
Nera
	He he he! You are rather good.
%0%a001240
	I can do it just as well!
	Watch me!
Bianca
	Um, you know when we're done with all this travellin' and we go back to the castle? I can still wear these kind of clothes, right?
Nera
	But wearing a dress like that must make you feel so pretty and special.
%0%a001240
	That kind of dress would probably really suit %a001250. Especially when she gets a bit older.
%0%a001250
	I'm a princess, but I've never worn a dress like that.
%0%a001240
	Hmm, sounds tricky.
Tuppence
	I suppose I support the lead, so to speak, by accompanying you on your travels, %a000090.
	It's true that it is rather difficult.
Bianca
	That's a good point. Travellin' certainly does broaden the mind.
Nera
	I've met all sorts of people, too. Meeting you was the best of all, though.
Tuppence
	I'd like to meet a few more people, too. Only the kind of folk who'll make me look good, mind you.
Bianca
	Did you know there was a cave all the way up here, %a000090?
Nera
	I had no idea there was a cave here.
%0%a001240
	I'm pretty curious to see what lies beyond this cave, aren't you?
%0%a001250
	There's a really funny atmosphere to this place.
Sancho
	C-C-C-Careful where djou are treading,
	My Majesty.
Tuppence
	Oh! There are no monsters here! Ha ha! I was rather dreading the fact that there would be.
Bianca
	You're not the only one who becomes all the more determined to do somethin' when you're told not to, %a000090!
Nera
	No doubt you're planning on moving it regardless? You have that defiant look on your face again.
%0%a001240
	ⓗThis stone must not be movedⓘ? I wonder who would write something like that.
%0%a001250
	If it says not to move it, then we shouldn't move it. ...Right?
Sancho
	Who would put esomething like this een here?
	Ees loco! I n-no like the f-f-feeling of this.
Tuppence
	When you see instructions not to do something, you tend to do it anyway, right, %a000090?
Bianca
	Do you sense a kind of heavy feeling in the air all of a sudden? We should be careful, %a000090.
Nera
	Be careful, darling. There are monsters about!
%0%a001240
	That strange stone slab...
	I wonder what it actually does.
%0%a001250
	Why did you go and move it when it said not to!?
Tuppence
	Dear me. Whyever did you move that stone slab, Your Majesty? Did you have too much time on your hands or something?
Bianca
	Hey! The monsters have disappeared!
Nera
	It seems to be something to do with that stone slab.
	What a strange cave this is!
%0%a001240
	Am I just imagining it, or have all the monsters disappeared? Why would that be?
%0%a001250
	Where have all the monsters gone?
Sancho
	Eet eseems as eef the air, ees cleared.
	Are djou feeling eet, too, chico?
Bianca
	Weird. It's like any sign of monsters is just drifitin' away. Still, I suppose we shouldn't complain!
Bianca
	There's somethin' a bit funny about this cave.
	I wonder what the story is.
Nera
	It feels so odd being able to take our time walking through a cave like this without always looking over our shoulders.
Nera
	I wonder where all the monsters are lurking.
%0%a001240
	Am I just imagining it, or have all the monsters disappeared? Why would that be?
%0%a001240
	You can see monster footprints all over the place, but there's no sign of the monsters themselves.
%0%a001240
	If it gets much quieter, I'm going to start having trouble staying awake!
%0%a001250
	That's odd. All the monsters are gone.
	I don't see a single one of them.
%0%a001250
	Ready or not...here we come!
%0%a001250
	I think the monsters must be playing hide and seek!
%0%a001250
	Right, right. left... Um, left...right, right... Ⓠ
%0%a001250
	It's just a little ditty that %a001240 taught me. It's to help me remember how to skip nicely.
%0%a001250
	Yoohoo! Monsters!
	...Why don't you answer me?
Sancho
	Djou know what eet ees, My Majesty? The monsters, they are escared of djou now. Because djou fight like the matador!
Sancho
	Si, ees g-good the monsters no b-b-bother us.
	But I... I estill w-w-worried.
Tuppence
	I say! There's something a bit odd here. There's no sign of any monsters whatsoever.
Tuppence
	I'm not very comfortable with this. I don't much like surprises. Still, at least this is a good one.
Tuppence
	Ah... (mumble mumble)...
	Oh dear! This won't do!
Tuppence
	Sorry, %a000090. Things are so quiet in here that I was almost falling asleep on the spot.
Tuppence
	Did you use holy water while I wasn't looking or something, %a000090?
Bianca
	What do you suppose is goin' on with this place?
	Why are the monsters here such pesky, persistent little things?
Bianca
	If there are this many monsters about, there must be somethin' pretty special in here that they're tryin' to stop us gettin' at.
Nera
	It's all or nothing with this cave when it comes to the number of monsters around. Rather too extreme for my liking.
Nera
	It would be nice to get ahead more quickly, but it looks like they're doing their hardest to stop us.
%0%a001240
	Be careful, Dad. The monsters in here
	are pretty scary.
%0%a001240
	This cave isn't far from Roundbeck, is it?
%0%a001240
	We'll have to tell all the townspeople to steer well clear of this place. It's far too dangerous!
%0%a001250
	Ouch! ...It's alright. I just tripped a bit, that's all.
%0%a001250
	The monsters here are really mean. It's like they're being controlled by something.
Sancho
	A brave conquistador, he knows when ees the good time to make a fresh estart.
Sancho
	Djou have b-become such a fine man, %a000090. I, I am so proud! Esometimes when I am walking behind djou, I forget djou are n-no djour father.
Sancho
	Today, ees been a very exhausting day. I g-gonna prepare for djou a nice hot bath and esomething esalty for dinner.
Tuppence
	Don't worry, %a000090. If the worst happens, I'll take good care of your beloved wife and children.
Tuppence
	Hmm. If only I'd brought a painter along with me.
Tuppence
	How nice it would be if I could show people at home a picture of me in a mighty fighting pose!
Tuppence
	I just can't keep up with this place. One minute there are no monsters at all, and then the whole place is overrun with them!
Bianca
	Hey! What d'you s'pose that is?
%0%a001240
	Are we done yet? Those stone slabs are really heavy. I'm tired!
%0%a001250
	Is that your robe over there, Dad?
Sancho
	Uf! Pushing these estones around these narrow passages, ees like dancing the salsa, no? Ees h-hard work.
