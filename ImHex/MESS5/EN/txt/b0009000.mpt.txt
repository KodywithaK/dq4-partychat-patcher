	A prince on a white horse came and...he came and asked Maria and...then Maria said yes and...

	They got married!
Nun of the Above
	It seemed as if Maria had hardly been back with us at the abbey a few days before Prince Harry returned.
Nun of the Above
	If the Goddess knew he was coming, She, in Her infinite wisdom of course, didn't tell any of us about it! It was quite a shock!
Nun of the Above
	Well that's Prince Harry married...
Nun of the Above
	I'm sure it would make the Goddess happy if you were to follow suit, %a000090.
Nun of the Above
	What joy Prince Harry has brought to the world, asking Maria for her hand in marriage!
Nun of the Above
	Let us hope the young Briscoletti girl from Mostroferrato finds someone soon too. Where has the sister who was taking her home got to?
Nun of the Above
	Perhaps it's this trouble with the ships I've been hearing about. Hardly any are sailing now, apparently. I hope she isn't stranded.

	My ambition's to be a dancer. Dancers are the prettiest girls in the world!
*: 
	That's what I came here for. But it's really hard trying to make it in the dancing game.
*: 
	I came here looking for a legendary shield I heard about.
*: 
	Something like that would go for a small fortuna. Ha ha ha! Get it? Fortuna!
*: 
	Gosh, darn it, I'd give my right arm to be in that casino right now.
*: 
	Oh, what the heck! I'm sick o' this store. I'm goin'!
*: 
	Why, hello there. Oh, you're a friend of my husband? I suppose you've heard what he's planning now, then?
*: 
	He gave up on the idea of goin' away to that castle to do business. Oh, yes! He's far too busy at the casino now to think about work!
*: 
	I don't know! Men!

*: 
	According to what I've heard, there's a king somewhere who collects those mini medals that
	crop up all over the place.
*: 
	I heard a rumour that the old guy was livin' it up on some island way down south. Sounds like he's got the right idea, huh?
*: 
	I keep tellin' my boy not to go playin' outside o' town, but he just won't listen.
	I sure am worried about him.
*: 
	I wish the world was a more peaceful place,
	and we didn't have to think about monsters the
	whole time.
*: 
	I came to this town because I heard there was a shop where you could buy a book called ⓗThe Big Book of Beastsⓘ.
*: 
	But the shopkeeper won't sell you one unless you've got a horse and cart first!
*: 
	I don't know what's stranger, the things the man sells, or the man selling the things!
*: 
	Now you look like a seasoned old trav'ller to me, pardner. In that case, you won't wanna be without this here Big Book of Beasts!
*: 
	I wanna say three thousand gold coins for it, but I just can't resist givin' you a discount, pardner! So how about we settle on a thousand?
*: 
	Yee-ha! You got yourself a deal!
	I'll just go on and put it in your bag for you.
	Ride 'em, %A0110%Xcowboy%Z%B0110%Xcowgirl%Z!
*: 
	Okay, pardner. You're the boss!
*: 
	Sorry, pardner, but you look to be a little
	short of cash.
*: 
	Don't be a stranger now, pardner. If I git ahold of any more unusual items, I'll be puttin' them up for sale. So come on by again, y'hear?
*: 
	Howdy, pardner! Now didn't I just sell you that mighty fine Big Book of Beasts?
*: 
	I ain't got no other fancy goods to be sellin' you right now.
*: 
	But I can't let my best customer leave empty-handed now, can I?
*: 
	So how about this? The only one of its kind found anywhere in the world, the famous Fortuna slime curio!
*: 
	I wanna say ten thousand gold coins for this fine article, but I just can't resist givin' you a discount, pardner! So how about five thousand?
*: 
	Hot dog! You're really gonna buy this slime curio from me for five thousand bucks?
*: 
	You got yourself a deal, pardner! I'll just put it right into your bag there for you and take that cash off your hands. Thank you kindly!
*: 
	Okay, pardner. You're the boss!
*: 
	Still too much for ya, huh, pardner?
	I'm pretty attached to it myself, you know...
*: 
	Sorry, pardner, but you look to be a little
	short of cash.
*: 
	Why, you've cleaned me out, pardner!
*: 
	But I ain't beat that easy. The Ole Fortuna Curiosity Shop'll ride again. Yes siree, it will! Yeehaw!
*: 
	So I'll be seein' ya 'round, huh, pardner?
*: 
	Did you buy one too?
*: 
	I thought so. You look like the type.
*: 
	They're selling ships in bottles down in the dockyard.
*: 
	They're pretty well-made. You wouldn't want to miss out on a souvenir of Lodestar Harbour now, would you?
*: 
	Step right up! Get your souvenirs here! One of these famous Lodestar ships in a bottle could be yours!
*: 
	Look at the superb construction! See the fine finish! And all for just one thousand gold coins! What d'you say?
*: 
	That's right! You'd be crazy to pass up this unbelievable offer. I'll just pop it in your bag for you.
*: 
	Oh dear! You haven't got enough cash.
	I can't discount something of this quality, you understand, %A0110%Xsir%Z%B0110%Xmadam%Z.
*: 
	Shame. But maybe next time, eh?
*: 
	%H0860%XA traveller%YTravellers%Z, are you? I was on the move myself until recently. Heading for that White King's Paradise everyone's talking about.

	But these ships in bottles I was making for fun were selling like hot cakes, so I thought to myself, ⓗHow much better can it get!?ⓘ
*: 
	Ah, you never know in this life, do you, eh?
*: 
	Get this! After six whole years at Heaven's Above Abbey, Rodrigo Briscoletti's daughter, Nera, has finally returned to Mostroferrato!
*: 
	It's rather sad parting after such a long time. We looked after Nera for many years, you know.
*: 
	I would have returned to the abbey sooner, but her family have been so hospitable.
*: 
	To be perfectly honest, we would have been glad to have her stay on with us.
*: 
	But her father has plans for her future, it seems. He's hoping to find a nice young man for her to marry.

	Ⓠ With a hand to the soil,
	I work my honest toil,
	and listen out for gossip as I sow Ⓡ
*: 
	You look lost, %H0860%Xtrav'ller%Ytrav'llers%Z. If you're lookin' for Mostroferrato, it's down south, through the tunnel.
*: 
	I'll let you in on a little secret. I did battle with a fearful monster in a cave just west of Hay not long ago.
*: 
	You'll never guess what it was...
	A great sabrecat of all things!
*: 
	I say it was fearful, but I could tell it'd had some contact with humans. It might even have been someone's pet once.
*: 
	Come to think of it, that'd be the way to tame it again, I suppose. By using something it remembered from its old owner...
*: 
	Now I don't mean to pry, but what's your opinion on women? D'you think they should be all demure an' unassumin' an' that?
*: 
	I thought as much. I s'pose I better sign up for a stint at the old abbey like Nera did, then.
*: 
	That's right! We women have more to offer than that now, dun't we!?
*: 
	I tell you what. If you're feeling bored, why don't you take a look at that book on the counter there?
*: 
	We have all sorts in here, you know. And they all write things in it. You travellers certainly like to keep up on your gossip, don't you?
*: 
	Oh, is that the Scuttlebutt Alledger you've got there? Oh, yes. That's full of tittle-tattle, that is.
*: 
	Keep it if you want to. It's all gossip, mind. Don't take it too seriously!
*: 
	You can't help having a few thoughts on the subject when you run an inn, you know...
*: 
	If you ask me, I'd much rather travel with a few friends than on my own. It'd be like having a family with you.
*: 
	Ooh, don't tell me! Let me guess!
	You've heard about that pretty little Nera and now you're hoping to get married to her!
*: 
	Ooh, wait till I tell everyone!
	But I wouldn't get your hopes up too much. She'd be quite a catch for you!
*: 
	Ooh, you'll never guess what I heard!
	Prince Harry of Coburg's got married!
*: 
	What's that? You're a friend of his?
	Ooh, tell all, tell all!
	What!? You didn't know!? Then go and ask him!
*: 
	I heard of a fellow in Zoomingale who knows the Zoom spell. That'd be the quickest way to get to Coburg.

*: 
	Ssss!
*:

*: 
	Welcome to Mostroferrato, ancient stronghold of the Briscoletti family.
*: 
	Me and my boy are always travelling about from place to place, you know.
*: 
	But this is a first, I can tell you.
	Have you heard about it?
*: 
	Just think, if you married one of Mr Briscoletti's daughters, you'd come into a small fortune overnight!
*: 
	The renowned millionaire, Mr Briscoletti, is looking for a suitable young man to marry his daughter, Nera.
*: 
	Of course, he's laid down some pretty stringent ground rules, but they say whoever he picks might even get the famous Briscoletti family shield!
*: 
	Looking for old Briscoletti's place? It's the
	flash mansion right at the far end of town.
	You can't miss it.
*: 
	Even the item shop's closed today so the owner can go and see what's happening. And that guy never takes a holiday!
*: 
	Thank the Goddess Mr Briscoletti's finally realised it's high time for his daughter Nera to settle down with a nice young gentleman.
*: 
	She's such a lovely girl. As pure as the driven snow, she is.
*: 
	Countless young hopefuls have come courting her in the past, you know.
*: 
	But her father's a very strict man of
	tradition and family values. He's turned
	them all away until now.
*: 
	You're %H0860%Xa traveller%Ytravellers%Z, aren't you? Travellers are cool. Me and my dad are travellers.
Bingo
	Aaarf, aaarf...
*: 
	I'm so bored. I suppose you're going to the mansion too, are you?
*: 
	I knew it! But you don't seem like
	the gold-digger type.
*: 
	What? Don't you know what's going
	on there today?
*: 
	All the young men in town have gone to
	Mr Briscoletti's mansion.
*: 
	Welcome, welcome! I'd say I can just about squeeze you in. Ha ha ha!
*: 
	We're not normally this empty, I assure you. Apparently Mr Briscoletti's making some big announcement today, you see.
~ ⓗUnderage drinking is protibihⓚⓛ probitihitⓚⓛ prohibited by law.ⓘ ~
*: 
	Well, well! %H0860%XA visitor%YVisitors%Z. And you must be about the same age as my boy, Crispin.
*: 
	I wish you young ones wouldn't take so long finding wives. It's a constant source of concern for us parents, you know.
*: 
	Although you're a traveller, I see.
	I expect you're married already, aren't you?
*: 
	I knew it! You must meet lots of suitable young ladies travelling about the place like you do.
*: 
	Really? Well, you don't want to leave it too long. We parents can't relax until we've seen our children married, you know.
*: 
	And mark my words, you won't be able to sweet talk the ladies forever. Once your youth's gone, you've had it!
*: 
	Don't listen to my wife. She doesn't know what she's talking about. Marriage is a lottery, my friend. A very risky lottery.
*: 
	Stop lazing about and put some tea on,
	you old waster!
*: 
	Oh! You're not my husband!
	I, I do apologise.
*: 
	My wife manages everything to do with the shop. My job's taking care of the housework.
*: 
	It's great being married to someone who's so in control. Although...I can do some things myself.
*: 
	Marriage is a blessed union of two souls in the presence of the Goddess.
*: 
	She will bestow happiness upon any couple who truly love one another.
*: 
	This is Mr Briscoletti's villa. He doesn't get
	out here much, though. It's just that little bit
	too far away.
*: 
	Welcome to the Briscoletti residence.
*: 
	Are you here to talk to Mr Briscoletti about marrying Ms Nera?
*: 
	Just wait over there then, please.
*: 
	In that case, I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to come back another time.
*: 
	Mr Briscoletti is very busy today talking to all
	Ms Nera's prospective grooms.
*: 
	You picked a great time to visit this place,
	my friend.
*: 
	Not that it'll do you much good. I don't intend to lose out on all Nera's wealth.
*: 
	It would be like a dream come true if
	I married Nera.
*: 
	I just wonder what these ⓗconditionsⓘ are
	going to be...
*: 
	Oh, are you here to ask for Nera's hand in marriage too?
*: 
	Well, I'm Crispin. Crispin Burns. Pleased to
	meet you. Nera and I have been friends since
	we were little.
Crispin
	I don't care about money or family heirlooms. The thought of marrying Nera is like asking for the moon. But if she picked me, I'd... I'd be over the moon!
*: 
	Thank you all for your patience. Mr Briscoletti is ready to see you now. Please go in.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Welcome, young Romeos!
	As I'm sure you are already aware,
	I am Rodrigo Briscoletti.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	And as you are all here in the hope of marrying my daughter, Nera, one of you will soon be calling me ⓗPapaⓘ, eh? Ha ha ha ha hah!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	But enough antipasto! Only a man of extreme virtue will marry my precious bambina.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	So. The rules.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	According to a very ancient legend, somewhere on our continent of Zephyrus, there are two rather unusual rings.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	They are called the Circle of Fire and the Circle of Water. They're said to bring good fortune to those who wear them.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	I have therefore decided that the suitor who brings them to me will marry my daughter with one of those very rings on his finger!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	And I will give my new son-in-law the treasured Briscoletti shield as a sign of acceptance into my great family.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Soⓚⓛ
*: 
	Wait!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Nera! Didn't I tell you to wait in your room?
Nera
	Papa. I've always done as I'm told. Always.
Nera
	But please, let me choose my husband for myself.
Nera
	Listen to me, all you brave young men. The Circle of Fire is said to be deep in a cave full of lava.
Nera
	A place like that is far too dangerous! I couldn't bear it if anyone was to get hurt because of me.
Nera
	............
Nera
	Aren't you...? The young man who stopped Bingo when he ran away before...?
Nera
	So, you came here for my hand in marriage?
	Wow! I, I mean, I don't know what to...
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Do you know this man, Nera?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Hm. Yes, you look like a reliable young fellow...
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Ahem! But only the man who brings me the two rings will have my permission to marry Nera!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Now, come with me, my bambina.
*: 
	Phew! That's a tall order, eh?
*: 
	The meeting's over now.
	Do be careful, won't you?
*: 
	Ms Nera is such a kind lady, I'm sure she'd make a wonderful wife.
Nera
	Papa's always been a very assertive man.
Nera
	Please, don't do anything dangerous for me.
Nera
	You don't need to bring me the Circle of Fire or the Circle of Water. Even without them, I'd...
Nera
	There's something about you. Something so familiar. Maybe it's your voice...
Nera
	Or maybe we met somewhere once before, long ago.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Hm? Are you still lingering, lad?
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	The Circle of Fire is said to be deep in a
	raging inferno in a cave to the south-east
	of here. Good luck!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Remember, I want both rings before I'll consider you worthy of my bambina!
*: 
	Once he's made up his mind about something, there's no talking to him.
*: 
	I do wish he'd have a bit more consideration for Nera's feelings in the matter, though.
*: 
	Welcome to Mostroferrato, ancient stronghold of the Briscoletti family.
*: 
	I've heard rumours, you know.
*: 
	People say the Briscoletti family shield is actually none other than the legendary Zenithian Shield.
*: 
	You're %H0860%Xa traveller%Ytravellers%Z, aren't you? Travellers are cool. Me and my dad are travellers.
Bingo
	Aaarf, aaarf...
*: 
	If I could've married Nera, I would've expanded the shop, you know.
*: 
	But I won't be able to do any expanding if I end up dead, will I?
*: 
	If you're still thinking of going, you'll be wanting to stock up on some decent items here before you head off, won't you?
*: 
	Who in their right mind would go off hunting
	for a couple of rings when there are monsters
	on the prowl?
*: 
	I heard the Circle of Fire was in some volcano to the south of here.
*: 
	You're hoping to marry Nera, are you?
	You'll need a stiff drink, then!
*: 
	Crispin told me all about it. So you're another of young Nera's suitors?
*: 
	But couldn't you just bow out? You must meet lots of young girls on your travels.
*: 
	Crispin and Nera have been bosom buddies since they were in nappies, you know.
*: 
	Don't listen to my wife. She doesn't know what she's talking about. Marriage is a lottery, my friend. A very risky lottery.
*: 
	Stop lazing about and put some tea on,
	you old waster!
*: 
	Oh! You're not my husband!
	I, I do apologise.
*: 
	My wife manages everything to do with the shop. My job's taking care of the housework.
*: 
	It's great being married to someone who's so in control. Although...I can do some things myself.
*: 
	Marriage is a blessed union of two souls in the presence of the Goddess.
*: 
	She will bestow happiness upon any couple who truly love one another.
*: 
	This is Mr Briscoletti's villa. He doesn't get
	out here much, though. It's just that little bit
	too far away.
*: 
	Welcome to the Briscoletti residence.
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	The Circle of Fire is said to be deep in a
	raging inferno in a cave to the south-east
	of here. Good luck!
Rodrigo Briscoletti
	Remember, I want both rings before I'll consider you worthy of my bambina!
*: 
	All this reminds me of my courting days.
*: 
	Rodrigo was quite the Romeo himself, you know.
	He had to put himself in great danger to win my hand in marriage.
Nera
	I'm sorry about Papa, %a000090.
	It's unreasonable to expect anyone to
	do things like this for me.
Nera
	I'm so worried about Crispin. Do you know him?
	He was at the meeting too.
Nera
	He wouldn't say boo to a goose when we were younger. I'm scared he'll push himself too far.
*: 
	I was attacked by monsters up in the mountains on my way here and I did my leg in.
*: 
	Fortunately a young lady from a nearby
	village happened to pass by and she dressed
	the wound for me.
*: 
	What an exceptional young woman to be out in the mountains all on her own!
*: 
	I lost my wife some time ago. She was killed by monsters while I was away travelling once.
*: 
	I wish I'd taken her with me now, even if it can be a bit dangerous at times.
Bingo
	Aaarf, aaarf...
*: 
	Zzz... Yeah! Come on, Dad!
	Let's get those monsterzzz...
	Zzz... Zzz...
*: 
	Have a few drinks here and forget all
	your troubles!
*: 
	Ah-phew, ah-phew...
*: 
	I've given up on marrying Nera now.
*: 
	But Crispin's really going for it. I've got to say,
	I'm a bit worried for him.
*: 
	Aaah! That's some good juice!
	You want to try some, lad?
	Go on, just one glass!
~ %0%a000090 downs the glass! ~
*: 
	Hey, are you alright? You looked like you could take it, but maybe I was wrong.
*: 
	That's it! You're looking tough now, lad!
	Hah hah hah!
*: 
	No? Listen to me, lad! If you can't take your drink, you'll never have the guts to chat to the ladies.
*: 
	You're hoping to marry Nera, are you?
	You'll need a stiff drink, then!
*: 
	Crispin told me all about it. So you're another of young Nera's suitors?
*: 
	But couldn't you just bow out? You must meet lots of young girls on your travels.
*: 
	Crispin and Nera have been bosom buddies since they were in nappies, you know.
*: 
	Ah-phew...
	Debora...and Crispin...again...
Crispin
	I can do this! I'm going to find those two rings!
Crispin
	I've even been practising some magic to
	impress Nera with.
Crispin
	...Frizz!
	There you go!
Crispin
	Uh-oh!
Crispin
	Cr-Cr-Crack!
Crispin
	A-Anyway. You've got yourself some competition,
	my friend!
Crispin
	I can do this! I'm going to find those two rings!
Crispin
	So you've got yourself some competition!
*: 
	Zzz... Zzz...
*: 
	If you don't rub a bit harder, it won't help one little bit, you old waster!
*: 
	Oh! You're not my husband!
	I, I do apologise.
*: 
	Everyone's gone to bed already, I'm afraid.
	Could you come back in the morning, please?
*: 
	Zzzz...
*: 
	Be quiet! What is this? Not more men pestering me!
*: 
	Sorry to disappoint you all, but I'm perfectly happy as I am. I've no intention of getting married.
*: 
	What are you doing down here, Debora?
*: 
	These gentlemen aren't here for you. I've invited them on Nera's behalf.
*: 
	Stop making a nuisance of yourself and go back to your room!
Debora
	For Nera? Huh! Well, good luck with that, Papa.
Debora
	I'll go back to my room then, if I'm not needed here. I can't afford to get too tired. It plays havoc with my complexion.
*: 
	That girl will be the death of me!
*: 
	I must apologise, gentlemen.
	Please, this way!
*: 
	I'm sorry? Why isn't he looking for a match for Debora as well?
Debora
	Who do you think you are?
	Is there a sign on the door saying
	ⓗscruffbags welcomeⓘ?
Debora
	Oh? You heard I was the older sister out of Nera and I, did you?
Debora
	So? What of it? If you think that means I'm looking to get married first, you can think again.
Debora
	What is it now? Do you want something, or not?
Debora
	Can't get enough of me, I suppose? I'm not surprised. Sometimes being so beautiful really is a curse, you know.
Debora
	Then stop gawping!
*: 
	We couldn't possibly expect anyone to... It would be far too much to expect of anyone.
