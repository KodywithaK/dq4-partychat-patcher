	Ouch!
Harry
	Listen to you, putting on airs like that, Frank!
Frank O'Phobe
	Ow ow ow! How dare you flick me, you insolent fool!? Who are you? How do you know my name!?
Harry
	Still scared of frogs, are you?
Harry
	Ha! You were frightened to death that time I put the frog in your bed!
Frank O'Phobe
	............
	No... I don't believe it!
Harry
	That's right, Frank. It's me, Harry!
Frank O'Phobe
	Y-You're still alive!
Frank O'Phobe
	It's been so many years! Those were happy days, looking back. The kingdom is in a terrible state now...
Harry
	Enough, Frank. You mustn't speak badly of your country. A soldier like you could get into a lot of trouble for that.
Frank O'Phobe
	Yes, sir!
Harry
	Will you let us pass, Frank?
Frank O'Phobe
	Of course! With pleasure!
Frank O'Phobe
	I never dreamt I'd be seeing your face again, Prince Harry.
Frank O'Phobe
	You were certainly a bit of a prankster in your time, but it all seems quite funny in hindsight.
Frank O'Phobe
	Ah, you're a friend of Prince Harry's, aren't you? Please go ahead and pass on through!
*: 
	I used to love this kingdom.
*: 
	But without us citizens realising it, we've suddenly been overrun with increasingly heavy-handed laws.
Harry
	Wait a minute, %a000090.
Harry
	If we carry on to Coburg now, we probably won't be able to come back this way for a while.
Harry
	It sounds like the people of Whealbrook have had a terrible time of it, don't you think?
Harry
	Maybe it would be worth trying to find the thing your father hid away and seeing if it can be of any help?
Harry
	He's supposed to have hidden something away in the cave in Whealbrook, right?
Harry
	Let's go back and see if we can find it.
Harry
	Wait a minute, %a000090.
Harry
	He's supposed to have hidden something away in the cave in Whealbrook, right?
Harry
	Let's go back and see if we can find it.
Harry
	You know, we still haven't dropped in on Whealbrook.
Harry
	I'm sure there must be people there who'd like to know you're safe, %a000090. Maybe we should pay them a visit first?
~ %0%a000090 senses the voice of his late father Pankraz calling out to him... ~

*: 
	You're still young. You can see for %H0860%Xyourself%Yyourselves%Z how things really are.
*: 
	If this land means anything to you, I'm sure you'll find a way to make things right.
*: 
	This is the Kingdom of Coburg.
*: 
	I don't know what your business is here, young man, but I'd recommend you steer clear of the castle if you know what's good for you.

	It's bin eight years now.
	I dunno what's become of him.

~ ⓗGlory to the Kingdom of Coburg! ~
~ All that we are and do is for the kingdom!ⓘ ~
~  ~
*: 
	I came along here because I heard that they're paying lots of money to enlist foreign soldiers and build up their army.
*: 
	It looks like the folk here are suffering for it, though. The tax they have to pay to cover the army's wages is sending them all broke.
Harry
	Hang on a minute.
Harry
	I think it'd be better if we kept my identity here a secret. Just until we know what's going on.
Harry
	Let's just pretend I'm no one special. Okay?
Harry
	I say! You're not planning on just turning back, are you!?
Harry
	Hmph. But I suppose there's not much choice if we simply can't get by.
Harry
	Wait a minute!
Harry
	I'm sure there was some kind of passage into the castle from the outside.
Harry
	I just can't remember where the entrance to it was. I seem to recall some kind of waterway...
*: 
	Legend has it that long ago, a castle came falling from the sky.
*: 
	Apparently, it's since that day that monsters have been terrorising mankind again.
*: 
	Only those summoned by the Queen Dowager are permitted beyond this point. Now, leave!
	Go on!
*: 
	Hm? The Queen Dowager asked to see you?
*: 
	Very well. But when your business here is done, you mustn't linger in the castle.
*: 
	Very well. But when your business here is done, you mustn't linger in the castle.
*: 
	The Queen Dowager is quite a ⓚⓛ Clank! ⓚⓛ ruler.
*: 
	It will not be long now before the Kingdom of ⓚⓛ Clank! ⓚⓛ Coburg rules the world! Wa ha ha!
*: 
	Awright, mate? You 'ere to join the army an' all, are ya? This place rocks!
*: 
	All you gotta do is fight, an' they give ya bags o' dosh! An' ya can eat all the grub ya like!
*: 
	You can't beat this as a place to live.
*: 
	The Chancellor and his crew are such a lily-livered bunch. We get our own way with everything. He he he!
*: 
	I can't help but feel that some of the soldiers the Queen Dowager has employed of late are a bit unsavoury.
*: 
	Oh! Oh dear! What am I doing, blurting out such foolish things? I take it all back!
*: 
	No! Argh!
	Oh, I was just dreaming.
*: 
	But it really did happen...
	If only I could just put it out of my mind.
*: 
	I know the Queen Dowager ordered it, but I feel so guilty for destroying that village when they'd done nothing to deserve it.
*: 
	These are Darwin the Psarologist's quarters.
*: 
	Hello there. The name's Darwin. I spend my time researching all about living things.
Darwin
	How have humans and other creatures evolved in the way they have? And could they ever develop into something more powerful?
Darwin
	It seems there was once a secret that unlocked these mysteries of evolution. Perhaps it was the hand of the Goddess.
*: 
	Is somebody there?
*: 
	I've been down here so long now that my eyes and ears have stopped working on me.
*: 
	But my mouth works just fine, so let me tell you this!
*: 
	The person responsible for Prince Harry's death is none other than the Queen Dowager!
*: 
	And yet she put on a good show of being distressed by the whole thing and then laid all of the blame squarely on Pankraz's shoulders!
*: 
	The cheek of the woman! She even took it so far as to destroy Pankraz's village, Whealbrook.
*: 
	I've never seen a woman so cruel and cold-hearted. The Goddess will punish her for this!
~ There's no response. ~
~ It's just a corpse. ~
*: 
	Oh! What a relief it is to see a friendly face!
*: 
	I'm the Queen Dowager, don't you know?
	You must help me to escape from this cell at once!
Queen Dowager
	What is it? Why are you dilly-dallying? Don't you believe I am who I say I am? Oh, blast!
Queen Dowager
	It is I. I'm the one who left Prince Harry for dead all those years ago, I tell you!
Queen Dowager
	But I was just doing what was best for my son,
	so that my dear Wilbur could become king.
Queen Dowager
	I know now that what I did was wrong.
Queen Dowager
	So I implore you, please get me out of here!
*: 
	I don't believe I've seen you before. Are you new in town? Then allow me to give you a tip.
*: 
	King Wilbur is the ruler of our kingdom,
	but it's really his mother, the Queen Dowager, who pulls all the strings.
*: 
	You'd be wise not to get on her wrong side.
	She'll have your head on a platter if you do.
*: 
	The Queen Dowager always used to dote on her son Wilbur.
*: 
	But as soon as he became king and her role changed from Queen Consort to Queen Dowager, it was like a sudden change came over her. 
*: 
	Now she acts as if he's nothing more than a nuisance getting in her way.
*: 
	I just can't fathom what's going on inside her head.
*: 
	Another poor fellow who dared to rebel against the current state of affairs was condemned to death today.
*: 
	I know the Queen Dowager must have her reasons, but surely this kind of thing can't continue.
Chancellor
	Do you have some kind of business here?
	I'm afraid King Wilbur is feeling a little
	under the weather at present.
Chancellor
	I must request that you come back at another time.
King Wilbur
	...............
King Wilbur
	...............
King Wilbur
	I believe my chancellor has explained the situation.
King Wilbur
	I'm not in the mood to speak with anyone today.
	You must leave.
~ Harry whispers in response. ~
Harry
	But a lackey should always listen to his master, wouldn't you say?
King Wilbur
	............!
King Wilbur
	Oh...!
	Good heavens!
King Wilbur
	I say, Chancellor! I wish to speak with this fellow in private. Make yourself scarce!
Chancellor
	Er... Y-Yes, Your Majesty!
King Wilbur
	Harry! My brother, Harry!
	You're alive!
Harry
	Indeed I am! Sorry I was gone so long.
	The thing is...
King Wilbur
	No! Mother is in jail!?
Harry
	Shh! Keep your voice down!
King Wilbur
	Hm, now I come to think of it...
King Wilbur
	I remember reading a story once about a mysterious mirror.
King Wilbur
	I think the book I read it in was in the castle vault.
King Wilbur
	Here. Take this key and go and see for yourself.
	I'm sure it'll be of use to you.

King Wilbur
	Maybe I never did really have what it takes to become a good king.
Chancellor
	What does King Wilbur think he's doing, ordering me to leave like that!?
Chancellor
	If only the Queen Dowager was in charge, our land would be peaceful again!

	Before he died, he tried to make arrangements so that his first son, Prince Harry, would become king when the time came.

	And so the second son, Wilbur, ended up taking the throne in his place.

	I'm a trader, travelling the world in search of unusual items.

	I heard there was a book here somewhere that makes mention of some kind of curiosity.

	My big sister used to run a shop here years ago, but then the taxes became too much for her.
*: 
	She ended up moving to Fortuna. People used to be much better off here in the past, but those days are gone.
