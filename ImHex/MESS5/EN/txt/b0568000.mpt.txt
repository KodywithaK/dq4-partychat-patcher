Bianca
	After all them years I spent away from you as a statue, I can really understand how painful it must be for your mum to have bin snatched away.
Nera
	So Grandmaster Nimzo is right before us.
	The time has finally come.
%0%a001240
	Grandma must be in here somewhere, right?
	I know she is. I can sort of sense it.
%0%a001250
	I'm getting the feeling that there are scary
	monsters all around us, just waiting for their
	chance to pounce.
Sancho
	You must estand on your toes.
	Thees mountain, ees full of dangers.
Tuppence
	So here we are at last. Who would've thought
	that I, Tuppence, would be part of such a
	momentous event?
Bianca
	I wonder how many more times we'll have to tread this path before Nimzo's defeated, eh?
Bianca
	Here's hopin' this is the last.
Nera
	On we go! We must succeed this time, and bring peace to the world!
%0%a001240
	The monsters here are really strong, so we'd better be extra careful this time.
%0%a001250
	I'm getting the feeling that there are scary
	monsters all around us, just waiting for their
	chance to pounce.
Sancho
	You must estand on your toes.
	Thees mountain, ees full of dangers.
Tuppence
	So here we are again. Who would've thought
	that I, Tuppence, would be part of such a
	momentous event?
Bianca
	I dun't mind goin' fast, %a000090, but it could be dangerous to hurry too much.
Nera
	This place is so cold. The air here has a very sinister feel to it.
%0%a001240
	I'm alright. I'm not scared of anything. 
	I'm your son, so I have no fear!
%0%a001250
	That big statue looks like it's staring at us.
Sancho
	You must remember the way as we go.
Sancho
	Ees no gonna be just one time we travel along these paths.
Tuppence
	I reached a point once where I felt rather disappointed at the uneventful sort of life I saw stretching out before me.
Tuppence
	And yet look at me here today! I never imagined I'd be involved in something so momentous.
Bianca
	Not long now, %a000090. It won't be long before we find your mum at last.
Nera
	It can't be much longer now. I'm sensing that your mother isn't far away.
%0%a001240
	Hang on a minute... What floor are we on now?
%0%a001250
	I'm sensing something really sinister lying in wait for us, but I can also feel a benevolent force in the air.
Sancho
	Are you tired, My Majesty?
Sancho
	Then you turn back esometimes, okay?
	The lives of all of us, they are een your hands.
Sancho
	You, you are amazing, friend!
	I weesh your papá, he could esee you now.
Tuppence
	Come on, you no-good monsters!
	Come and give it your best shot!
Tuppence
	I won't let any of them lay a claw on you, %a000090. Even if I have to lay my own life on the line to stop them.
Bianca
	I can't get used to this place, no matter how many times we come.
Nera
	Now your mother's no longer here, the only thing left on this mountain is an aura of evil.
%0%a001240
	Hang on a minute... What floor are we on now?
%0%a001250
	We've made Ladja pay for hurting Grandma, but Nimzo still has to be put in his place.
%0%a001250
	If it wasn't for him, Grandma would never have ended up here.
Sancho
	Are you tired, My Majesty?
Sancho
	Then you turn back esometimes, okay?
	The lives of all of us, they are een your hands.
Sancho
	You, you are amazing, friend!
	I weesh your papá, he could esee you now.
Tuppence
	Come on, you no-good monsters!
	Come and give it your best shot!
Tuppence
	I won't let any of them lay a claw on you, %a000090. Even if I have to lay my own life on the line to stop them.
Bianca
	D'you hear that, %a000090? I swear I can hear the sound of someone prayin'.
Nera
	This is it, darling! Listen!
	It sounds like someone praying.
%0%a001240
	Is this the top of the mountain?
	It's bigger than I expected.
%0%a001250
	Hang on in there, Grandma!
	We'll all be there to rescue you soon.
Sancho
	Qué? Ees...
	I feel esometheeng eso familiar...
Sancho
	Ees estrange een a place like thees, but...you
	no feel eet too? I no have the right words to explain eet.
Tuppence
	I'm rather curious about what that nasty-coloured mist swirling around our feet is.
Tuppence
	Though perhaps this is one of those occasions where ignorance is bliss.
Bianca
	Pankraz, Mada...
	Please watch over us and keep us safe.
Nera
	Pankraz, Mada... I implore you to watch over us and keep us safe.
Bianca
	Pankraz, dear Pankraz...
	And poor Mada...
Bianca
	We're so thankful to have seen you both again, even just for a short time.
Bianca
	Please watch over us. I know your good wishes will be enough to keep us all safe.
Nera
	No... Don't go, Mada!
Nera
	Just once... If only you could've held %a000090 just once!
%0%a001240
	Grandpa! Grandma!
%0%a001240
	It's not fair! We only just found you.
	It's just not fair!
%0%a001250
	(sob) Waah... (sniff)
Sancho
	You, you must feel proud, friend. Proud that you are the eson of señor Pankraz and señora Mada. You never forget thees, okay?
Sancho
	Ees all your Uncle Sancho can esay to you now. Ees all I can... I can... (sob)
Tuppence
	I'll never forget the events that have unfolded before me today.
Tuppence
	The love that King Pankraz and Queen Mada have for each other is truly breathtaking to behold.
Bianca
	This place has a different sort of air to it.
	And it's not a nice one.
Nera
	There's a nasty feel to this place. This is probably the true face of the mountain.
%0%a001250
	Yikes! Dad! The wall... It looks like someone's face!
Bianca
	This kind of place really irritates me. I hate not bein' able to walk where I want.
Nera
	We have to plan out our route carefully and try not to hurry too much. It's the only way to get through a place like this.
%0%a001240
	I'd usually be having a right laugh in a place like this, sliding about on the floor.
%0%a001240
	I just can't seem to get in the mood today, though.
%0%a001250
	There's so much I wanted to say to Grandma.
	And I wanted to play lots of games together too.
%0%a001250
	I kept imagining us going home to Gotha together. Haa...
Sancho
	Ees no need to worry about señora Mada. Eshe ees weeth señor Pankraz. Notheeng can hurt her.
Sancho
	Ees time to feel happy, sí? We pummel thees desperado, Ladja. And now, we gonna pummel the Grandmaster of the Underworld!
Tuppence
	I don't suppose we'll be lucky enough to reach
	our destination if we just slide about the place willy-nilly, will we?
Bianca
	Mada!? It sounds like your mum is watchin' over us, %a000090! That's the best encouragement we could hope for.
Nera
	Was that... Was that your mother's voice?
	Oh, darling! So she's still nearby, looking out for us!
%0%a001240
	What's aspi...aspa...aspersorium?
	And where do you get it?
%0%a001250
	We don't have an aspersorium, do we, Dad?
	It would be good if we could find one nearby.
%0%a001250
	The aspersorium is full of really clear and
	pure water.
%0%a001250
	Maybe I'll use it one day to water some of my favourite plants.
Sancho
	Ees, ees the voice of señora Mada!
	All the way from the heavens!
Bianca
	This place is absolutely enormous. I wonder where Nimzo could be lurkin'.
Bianca
	Imagine what would happen if Nimzo unleashed his evil powers on our world...
Bianca
	We have to hurry, %a000090! I can't stand to see folk sufferin' even one minute longer.
Nera
	This is a big place, isn't it? You'd never know you were inside a mountain.
Nera
	Maybe it's an indication of just how powerful Nimzo really is.
%0%a001240
	I'm going to take up the challenge where Grandpa and Grandma left off...and I'm going to succeed!
%0%a001240
	Nimzo... I doubt I'll ever forget that name for the rest of my life.
%0%a001250
	Dad... I'm going to do my best, you know.
	I'm going to make sure we win.
%0%a001250
	We already defeated Ladja, but now we have to defeat Nimzo too. As long as he's still around, the nasty monsters won't go away.
Sancho
	You no become confused now, okay?
	Ees just one theeng we must do.
Sancho
	You know, sí, friend? I no need to espell eet out for you.
Tuppence
	It's good that we can see all around, but this place is a little on the large side. We'll have to be careful not to lose our way.
Tuppence
	As representative of the soldiers of Gotha, I will take on the evil Nimzo and bring him to justice!
Bianca
	Um, %a000090...
Bianca
	Never mind. There'll be plenty of time for us to
	talk later.
Nera
	Um, darling...
Nera
	No, never mind. Sorry to trouble you.
%0%a001240
	I'm glad I turned out to be the hero. I'm sure that's the reason why I've been able to become so strong.
%0%a001240
	That's all I ever wanted, right from when we first met. I just wanted to become strong so that I could help you, Dad.
%0%a001250
	The sinister air in here is becoming gradually thicker...
Sancho
	Egh! I no know why, but I can no estop theenking about the past.
Sancho
	About the time señor Pankraz, he ordered for me to accompany heem on hees journey to find señora Mada.
Tuppence
	I must say that I'm ever so grateful you chose me as your companion here, %a000090.
Tuppence
	When we return home to Gotha, I'll be able to tell everyone how even a lowly character like me can
	do anything if he puts his mind to it.
Bianca
	What is this place? It all looks totally confusin' if you ask me.
Bianca
	I'm rubbish at figurin' out things like this. I'll have to leave it to you, I'm afraid, %a000090.
Nera
	I see! We have to go like this, and then like that, and then... No, wait a minute...
%0%a001240
	This room's really weird. The monsters who thought this up must be pretty pleased with themselves.
Bianca
	All this nasty air is startin' to make me dizzy.
	But we can't let this place get the better of us.
Nera
	Being at this sort of height makes you feel all dizzy, doesn't it? We won't let it stop us now, though.
%0%a001250
	I'm scared. I don't want to look down!
	Is this what a bottomless pit looks like?
Sancho
	I, I esure ees gonna be okay, but...you be
	careful where you put your feets, okay?
	I no gonna esave you eef you fall!
%0%a001240
	I'll bet the ancient legendary hero felt a bit scared when the time came to do battle with the
	Lord of the Underworld.
%0%a001240
	So it doesn't mean anything that I'm a bit nervous.
	I'm definitely going to win!
%0%a001250
	I'm actually really scared, but being with you makes it a little bit easier, Dad.
%0%a001250
	I'm really glad I was born your daughter. Sorry...
	I don't know how to say what I mean very well.
Sancho
	Sí. Ees time...
Sancho
	Ees time for your Uncle Sancho to finish what señor Pankraz, he estarted. Thees Nimzo,
	he no gonna be around much longer.
Tuppence
	I trust you've been enjoying these little chats with me along the way, %a000090?
Tuppence
	Oh good! That is nice to hear. I couldn't have wished for a better answer.
Tuppence
	Oh, er... I see. What a pity. I put so much effort into trying to keep you entertained.
Bianca
	Um, %a000090...
Bianca
	This could be the last chance we have to talk,
	so there's somethin' I want to say.
Bianca
	D'you remember the vows we made back
	in Mostroferrato?
Bianca
	We stood there in that church and promised to love each other forever.
Bianca
	If we die here, it looks like we'll be dyin' together at least. But we have to try to get through this and go home to Gotha hand-in-hand.
Nera
	I must apologise to you, darling. I haven't been a good wife or mother, and I know I've caused you lots of stress.
Nera
	When we were married and we left Mostroferrato together, I tried my very hardest so I'd be able to keep up with you.
Nera
	I'll always be grateful to Mama and Papa for bringing me up, but being chosen by you like
	that was when I first knew true happiness.
Nera
	I felt as if we were destined to be together, to have a family together, and I couldn't have been happier.
Nera
	We owe it to our love to make sure we come out of this alive and return home to live in peace in Gotha.
Nera
	Then we can finally give %a001240 and %a001250 the childhood they deserve.
Debora
	Your mother is in here somewhere, %a000090.
	We should hurry up and rescue her.
Debora
	This is the last time I'm coming here. We're going to defeat Nimzo once and for all, and go home to our proper lives.
Debora
	To think that I'm going to challenge the Grandmaster of the Underworld! I would never have imagined it back when I was living at home.
Debora
	It's not exactly the kind of thing you daydream of,
	is it?
Debora
	It won't be long now, %a000090. Your mother's not far away, I can sense it.
Debora
	I don't want to be here any longer than we have 
	to. Surely you don't either? I can't stand places
	like this.
Debora
	Over here, %a000090!
	I can hear someone praying!
	You know what this means...!
Debora
	Your poor mother and father...
	I'm going to avenge their deaths, %a000090.
	Just you wait and see.
Debora
	You heard what your father said. They'll be watching over us. They'll be by our side forever.
Debora
	............
Debora
	Well, I'm not going to disappoint them!
	They can watch over us as much as they like, and they won't find fault with me!
Debora
	I don't want to be here any longer than we have to. Neither do you, right? I can't stand places like this.
Debora
	This is starting to get really old! I'm fed up with not being able to go where I'm trying to go.
Debora
	Surely that voice...!?
	Your mother really is incredible, %a000090.
Debora
	This place is annoyingly big. Just another sign of Nimzo's power, I suppose. He certainly likes to
	show off.
Debora
	Maybe it's on account of my anger, but I'm feeling great surges of power stirring deep within me.
Debora
	Watch out, Nimzo! It's all coming your way!
	You'd better steel yourself for the fight of your life!
Debora
	Um, %a000090...
Debora
	Actually, forget it. Let's push on.
	There'll be plenty of time to talk later.
Debora
	Just looking at this place winds me up.
	You can figure this one out, %a000090.
Debora
	We're quite high up here. But it'll take a lot more than that to stop me in my tracks!
Debora
	Um, %a000090...
	You probably know this already, but...
Debora
	Actually, maybe you don't know.
	Well, I may as well come out with it...
Debora
	%0%a000090...
	Do you believe in fate?
Debora
	You see, when we first met, I felt something.
	It was like a shiver running down my spine.
Debora
	It's lucky that you're adventurous, otherwise you would never have chosen me. And I am grateful that you chose me, even if I don't always show it.
Debora
	That's all I wanted to say. Come on, let's go!
	Before long we'll be returning home safe and sound to Gotha.
Tuppence
	Oh, for the Goddess' sake, this place is driving me
	to distraction.
Debora
	You don't need to tell me, Tuppence!
	I couldn't agree more.
	I'm about to rip my hair out here!
