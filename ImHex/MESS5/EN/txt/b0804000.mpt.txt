~ Uh-oh! The treasure chest is actually %a040190! ~

~ Neatly arranged plates, cups and other crockery adorn the shelves. ~
~ It's a very old, but really quite superb, pipe organ. ~
~ There are various drinks lined up on display. ~
~ A picture hangs on the wall. ~

~ %0%a000120 has a look inside the pot. ~

~ %0%a000120 gazes into the mirror... ~
~ There are bits of %A0110%Xhis%Z%B0110%Xher%Z dinner all around %A0110%Xhis%Z%B0110%Xher%Z mouth! ~
~ %0%a000090 tries to make himself laugh by pulling ~
~ a funny face. ~
~ ...Wow! Talk about feeling lonely! ~
~ %0%a000090 studies his face intently. He thinks he's looking more and more like his father every day. ~
~ If he smiles, he doesn't actually look all that bad! ~
~ He sticks his tongue right out. ...What a discovery! ~
~ He can touch the tip of his nose with it! ~
~ Donk! He gets a bit too close and bashes his head! ~
~ He touches the mirror and leaves a very conspicuous fingerprint! ~
~ He opens his mouth wide to check for bad teeth! ~
~ He tries to picture his dad's face by looking at his own reflection. ~
~ A smiling face with a healthy tan stares back! ~
~ Memories of all the trials and tribulations he's had to face come flooding back. ~
~ Looking at his own reflection seems to make him want to yawn! ~
Harry
	Well! It's been so long since I last peered into a mirror, I'd clean forgotten what I looked like!
Harry
	Who would ever imagine I was royalty with a grubby face like this?
Harry
	Dear Goddess! Is that a five o'clock shadow or have I just not had a wash for ages?
Harry
	Look at that! That's a man's visage, that is, not a boy's. Wouldn't you agree, %a000090?
Harry
	You can tell I've spent a lot of time outdoors. Any darker and they'll start calling me the Prince of Darkness!
Bianca
	Oops! Someone could've told me I had cream smeared all over my face like a big idiot!
~ She sees %a000090's reflection beside hers in the mirror. ~
Bianca
	That's a sweet-lookin' face, that is. For a lad, I mean.
Bianca
	Mirrors are a bit weird, if you ask me. I always find myself wonderin' if there's someone on the other side.
~ She smiles prettily. ~
~ She purses her lips and tries to look all angry! ~
Bianca
	Well, that's today's hairdo sorted.
	Time to get movin'.
Bianca
	I'm gettin' a bit fed up with this style lately.
	Maybe I should try lettin' my hair down for once.
~ She grabs her cheeks and pulls them out! ~
Bianca
	Pullin' on your skin like this every now and then is a tried and tested way of keepin' it young, apparently.
Bianca
	No way! I look like I've got huge dark circles under my eyes.
Bianca
	I reckon it must be the mirror. Yeah, that's it.
	This mirror must be broken or somethin'.
Bianca
	I've just remembered how I used to wear my hair in two plaits back when I was a little girl.
Bianca
	I wonder when it was that I switched to wearin' it like this.
~ She discreetly fixes her lipstick! ~
~ The reflection of a girl who's grown into a beautiful woman looks back. ~
Bianca
	I'm happy as I am now an' all that, but I sometimes wish I could go back to bein' a kid for a while. Stupid of me, really...
Nera
	Oh dear... No one's cleaned this mirror for ages by the look of it.
~ Nera hurriedly polishes it. ~
Nera
	Oh, bother!
Nera
	I'll never be able to do it! How on earth do you go cross-eyed?
~ She tries to remember what she had for breakfast yesterday, but it's no good. ~
Nera
	Long or short? I just want my hair to be the way my darling likes it.
~ Her hair's looking a bit of a mess... ~
~ She takes out a pretty brush and starts to run it through her long, dark hair. ~
~ She suddenly chuckles as if she's remembering something funny. ~
~ The reflection of a pretty young woman looks back. ~
%0%a001240
	I'm going to be really tall like Dad when I'm older!
%0%a001240
	...Only, even though I drink my milk everyday, I don't seem to be growing at all.
~ %0%a001240 sticks his thumbs in his ears and wiggles his fingers. ~
%0%a001240
	Ah ha ha ha hah! That'd make anyone laugh!
%0%a001240
	Grrr...
%0%a001240
	Come on, a bit more!
%0%a001240
	I'm trying to break my record. You have to stare into the mirror without blinking for as long as possible.
~ %0%a001240 laughs self-consciously. ~
~ The reflection of a slightly precocious boy looks back. ~
~ He brushes a cut on his forehead with the back of his hand. ...Ouch! That hurt! ~
%0%a001240
	I bet I'll look just like Dad when I grow up.
%0%a001250
	Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?
~ ............ ~
~ The mirror doesn't seem to know! ~
~ She reties the ribbon in her hair in a pretty little bow. ~
%0%a001250
	I want to grow my hair longer. Then I'll be able to plait it.
%0%a001250
	I wish it would hurry up and grow!
%0%a001250
	I wish I had a flower ribbon.
~ She has a go at a cool wink... ~
~ ...but it just ends up as a disconcerting blink! ~
~ She grins. ~
~ She feels a warm glow inside as she sees a bit of her father in her. ~
~ He taps his belly lightly... ~
~ Boom! All that paella wobbles reassuringly! ~
Sancho
	Anda! These grey hairs, they geeve away how many, many years your Uncle Sancho ees alive, no?
~ But the mirror's just not wide enough to show all of that well nourished belly, no matter where he stands! ~
~ He sighs heavily. ~
Sancho
	Thees mirror, ees eso clean, no? And the floor, ees weethout all the dusts, eh?
Sancho
	Sí, sí... Ees a good feeling to be een esuch a clean place.
~ He smoothes his moustache. ~
Tuppence
	Mirrors are strange things, aren't they?
	I mean, under normal circumstances, you don't get to have a good look at yourself, do you?
~ He shifts around, trying to find his best angle! ~
Tuppence
	That reminds me. Have you ever heard of the mirror that's supposed to reflect your true self?
Tuppence
	Dear Goddess! What on earth would it make of me, I wonder?
Tuppence
	You never know who you're going to run into, do you? Always a good idea to keep up appearances.
Tuppence
	Now then, Tuppence. Remember, whatever monsters you face, don't panic. You're brave. You're brave! You're BRAVE!
~ Oops! He appears to have frightened himself... ~
%0%a001210
	Grrarrrgh!
~ He appears to be trying to intimidate himself! ~
%0%a001210
	Grrr... Grrr...
~ He's clawing at the mirror, trying to catch his own paws! ~
~ He finds it really weird that the beast in the mirror is copying his every move! ~
~ He looks like he's thinking how much bigger and stronger he is than the puny cat in the mirror! ~
%0%a001210
	Grrreoow...
~ Hmph! It just makes a compliment seem so hollow when exactly the same thing's said back to you. ~
~ %0%a001210 just can't seem to grasp that he's looking at his own reflection! ~
~ %A0110%XHe%Z%B0110%XShe%Z turns stiff with fear! ~
~ %A0110%XHe gazes curiously at his%Z%B0110%XShe gazes curiously at her%Z reflection. ~
~ %A0110%XHe%Z%B0110%XShe%Z's sizing up the opposition! ~
~ %A0110%XHe calls to his%Z%B0110%XShe calls to her%Z brethren... ~
~ But no one comes. ~
~ %0%a000120 seems to think %A0110%Xhis reflection is another one of his%Z%B0110%Xher reflection is another one of her%Z own kind. ~
~ %A0110%XHe's so surprised, he%Z%B0110%XShe's so surprised, she%Z runs off! ~
~ The door is locked. ~
~ The door is locked, and it doesn't look like any of the keys in %H0860%X%a000120%Ythe party%Z's possession will open it. ~
~ %0%a000120 tries to look inside the chest of drawers. ~
~ But %A0110%Xhe%Z%B0110%Xshe%Z soon realises you can't open drawers from the back! ~
~ %0%a000120 tries to look inside the drawer. ~
~ But %A0110%Xhe%Z%B0110%Xshe%Z soon realises you can't open drawers from the back! ~
~ Oops! %A0110%XHe%Z%B0110%XShe%Z was looking at the back of it! ~
~ Mini medals do not appear in your normal inventory. ~
~ If you want to see how many mini medals you've collected, open the Attributes menu and move the cursor to the wagon symbol. ~
~ An attractive woman gazes back. ~
Debora
	I really am pretty, aren't I?
	No. Not pretty. Beautiful.
~ Debora is enraptured! ~
Debora
	It's very important that I look my best at all times. You'll have to wait a while.
~ Debora pulls out a make-up pouch from her bosom. ~
~ Oh no! She's started fixing her make-up. This could take some time... ~
~ Her lips look a bit dry. ~
~ She takes some lip balm out of her make-up pouch and rubs it on. ~
~ The mirror's a little bit dirty. ~
Debora
	Unbelievable! How am I supposed to use this when it's not clean? Someone polish it! Quickly!
	I need to see myself!
~ Another day looking absolutely great! Debora seems happy with how she looks. ~
~ Her hair looks a little ruffled. ~
Debora
	H-How is this possible!? How could you let me walk around like this? If anyone saw me, I'll hold you solely responsible.
~ She smiles at her reflection. There's... There's something a bit creepy about the way it smiles back! ~
~ No... Debora decides she must've been imagining it. ~
Debora
	Perfect skin as always! Not that I needed to check, but it's always nice to look at yourself...when you look as good as me.
Debora
	I'll be needing a new outfit soon. Actually, I'll be needing several so I can see how different things go together.
~ The door appears to be locked from the other side. ~
~ The door is shut fast. ~
~ The door appears to be held tightly shut by some mysterious power. ~
~ A book's been left open here. ~
